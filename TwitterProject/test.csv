1,I have to put this in writing somehow so I stick to it. feels good honestly
2,"I've made my peace with the fact that I'm going to kill myself... One day. My head is a train wreck, my life skills are nonexistent, I have zero reliable friends, I'm disconnected from my family, I'm basically alone 24/7 with my toxic thoughts... But despite all of that there's a degree of comfort in knowing that I can grab a knife or tie a noose at any given moment. For some people going out on our own terms is the best we can hope for. A small victory to end a life of constant losses. I'll take it."
3,I really want help now i just cant so this anymore alone i feel hopeless
4,"I can't think of any reason to stay. I have no sense of stability in any area of life and I'm fucking terrified. Narcissistic parents that didn't want me. No friends. I've experienced how wonderful life can be, just for marvelling at existence itself and appreciating its divinity - appreciating my senses etc. It's not enough though. My basic human needs aren't being met and I've tried everything. I can't seem to play the character that I need to in order to move through the world. I'm tired. Nothing's getting better, it's getting worse and I'm not a teenager anymore - I'm a woman in my late twenties. I want out. I'm done being alone and being in these terrifying situations. I'm ready to die."

6,"Hi, it's my first post here, I'm new in this community. So... I've been struggling with suicidal thoughts for at least 8 years now. Today is my 25th birthday. Things have been extremely bad lately. I lost my job that I adored and I feel useless because of unemployment, I live in a country where unemployment rates are extremely high and my field of work doesn't have many opportunities. Even outside of it, it's hard to find work. I feel hopeless and it has made my suicidal thoughts much worse.

I actually plan to do it tonight. I had a shitty birthday and I really don't need to live a day more. Leading up to today, I've broken up with my girlfriend and pushed my family members away from me as much as possible, so it will lessen their pain. It hurts a lot, but it's for their own good.

I've tried therapy and medication, it helped briefly but my psychiatrist told me that my depression will keep coming back easily, I have family history of depression and suicide so it's no wonder. I can't keep going through this and bringing down my loved ones. I can't keep living like this.

I guess the reason I made this post is to vent. I don't know if I'm actually going to go through it tonight. I hope I'll be able to. My feelings have gone numb and I just want to close my eyes forever. I called a suicide hotline and the operator tried to guilt me into staying alive by telling me all about how my family will miss me... I know they will, but it will pass with time. I'm very worried about them, but I can't keep living for them. It's been the only reason I've kept living all these years... I can't do this anymore.

So, tonight might be the end. Sorry for venting. I'm keeping it a secret, obviously, but I felt like I had to tell someone, even anonymously on reddit. Goodbye."

8,What the fuck is even the point when no one gives a shit about me? Their life makes no difference if I‚Äôm here or not. I want the pain to stop so badly I just want to die.
9,"I assume the person cutting is a girl but i‚Äôm not sure. I was scrolling through random hashtags about adhd because i have it. Then in a post i clicked a self harming hashtag. Then I saw her profile with 2 or 3 posts of her cutting herself. Very new, and its been 6 days since she‚Äôs first made the profile.

First attempt talking:
Titles herself as an unwanted person. She wants help, and I saw it and I fucking had to do something. I couldn‚Äôt just leave someone crying for heIp. I‚Äôve tried to talk to her using knowledge I‚Äôve read online. She doesn‚Äôt want to talk to me and replies with ‚Äúidk‚Äù constantly. So i said I‚Äôll leave her and told her to think about seeking a professional. Told her to remember it‚Äôll pass and some other things. So i stopped talking for 2 days.

Second attempt:
I came back to her profile account, and saw her new posts. She was trying to talk to me through her captions accompanied by photos with more cuts. She said ‚Äúif you can‚Äôt help me no one can‚Äù and ‚Äúhelp‚Äù. 

So i messaged her/him again asking if she thought about seeking professional help yet. She wrote ‚Äúabout?‚Äù and ‚Äúty‚Äù and asked how old i was. She then posted on her profile page again with ‚Äúi need you but you don‚Äôt seem to need me üôÉüî´‚Äù with more fucking cuts...probably because it took me a while to respond since i didn‚Äôt see it. 
Back to the private messages. I said i was 19. She‚Äôs seen my message and hasn‚Äôt responded for about 4 hours now.

I then texted ‚Äúdo you live with your family‚Äù just recently. I need help right now. I need as much help to stop this, I can‚Äôt let this go. I‚Äôm not experienced with this, i only messaged her because i was the only one who has seen it. This is so sad."
10,"Everything has been a mess. I cannot keep doing this anymore. Even after 3 years of self-healing, and therapy, I cannot find peace in anything I do. Everything is tainted with bullshit. I just wanna kill myself. But I cannot find the courage to. I just need the courage to. If someone here could give me that push, that way to gather up the courage, I will forever be grateful to them."
11,"Like many of you, I am single, live alone, I have almost no social life. Social isolation is contributing to the rapid deterioration of my mental health. 

I have little to no support system, and I am struggling with sobriety. I can hold it together while sober, but if I end up drinking, I will kill myself. 

I still care about other people so I‚Äôm not going to disregard social distancing rules. I also understand that it is unrealistic to ask the immunocompromised to suffer on my behalf so I can get out the house. 

Regardless, my isolation-induced suicide is an acceptable public health outcome... which I understand. My life isn‚Äôt that worthwhile. I‚Äôm a terminally depressed Wasteoid so why should society care? Society would be much worse of if my immunocompromised parents died than if I died anyway. 

I do sometimes wonder how many suicides it will take for quarantine to have not been worth it... 

Here‚Äôs to another day of not doing it"
12,
13,I can‚Äôt. Please. Why does God keep doing this to me. Why does it always have to end this way. I tried my hardest in this relationship and now I‚Äôm gonna be in the same place I was last year. Maybe I‚Äôm not meant to live. I think that‚Äôs how I‚Äôm supposed to go. I thought I was getting better with therapy but it‚Äôs all unraveling. Please. I need a way out. I can‚Äôt keep doing this. I don‚Äôt want to keep doing this. It‚Äôs too exhausting to live. Please. Just let me rest.
14,"29F. Single for years because I can‚Äôt manage relationships. Lonely. Been depressed my whole adult life. Have bipolar and tend to fuck up my life in the brief periods of mania - scars, risky sex, and now a broken heel.

Non stop health problems. Endometriosis, a gut parasite leading to severe abdominal bloating non stop for the past 5 months, PCOS, acne. Have been unable to work and am just a place where money goes to die. 100% financially reliant on my dad, who uses that to control me. The only acceptable job for me in his eyes is as a lawyer. Been chipping away at the degree for 5 years and am still only halfway through.

There is no hope for me. My body is fighting against me. In some ways it is permanently broken. I don‚Äôt want children or a partner, and yet without these I can‚Äôt see the point of life. I have no career aspirations because I hate everything. I am in constant existential or physical pain. I can‚Äôt do it anymore. My life has not been like most of my peers‚Äô lives, and I can‚Äôt connect with them because of it. I want to sink back into the earth, and float around as insouciant dust. That sounds like the only peace for me."
15,"Hi, I'm looking for advice or encouragement to kill my self. I'm really depressed and having a real bad time living since 2010.

I want to hang my self, my plan is to go far into a forest and just do it. My plan is setup but I need the courage just to go and do it.

What do you think? Do I need alcohol to fuel the suicide will? Should I just go for it in the middle of the night when I have anxiety and panic attacks? Or should I just be Spontaneous? 

Too much planing is dumb I know, I will do it somehow anyway."
16,"I took 12g of ketipinor 20min ago. 
All i want say is sorry to everyone but i couldnt continue live like this. 
Also im sorry to my therapist who called last week. I purposefully didnt tell you the truth. Nothing you could have done."
17,"This is my 5th or 6th bout of extreme depression, and every new one is harder than the one before. Last time, I tried to kill myself a few times and nothing worked, but I've gotten better at doing the drug calculations and I'm pretty sure they'll work if I try again. The only reason I can't right now, is because I have a dog and a cat who depend on me, and another dog who belongs to a friend, who I'm fostering (the dog, not the friend).

These are the things which are making me miserable -
1. I hate myself. I have no self worth and I cannot see myself as worth loving or being around. 
2. There is a guy I like. We kinda were together for a while, but we were long distance and then we broke. We occasionally text now and even though he acts the way he should (by this, I mean, pretty indifferent), I care more than I should. And that sucks. He's the only guy I've ever thought was good for me and even though I'm fully aware of his flaws, he was good for me, and it sucks that he doesn't really care.
3. I'm a grad student. I'm in the middle of my PhD. Even though I do love my work most of the time, sometimes, it hits me that I'm not doing what I always wanted to do. And maybe I never will. And even this, I feel very mediocre. And for someone who has always been am over achiever, this kind of just jogging along without proper progress is excruciating.
4. I've always wanted to do certain other things with my life even though doing a PhD was my primary goal. I wanted to write. I wanted to do something with music. I wanted to try spoken word poetry, I wanted to do other things and somehow none of those things are working out. It's a lack of opportunity, but it's also a severe lack of motivation as of right now. It's a vicious cycle.
5. My health has become crap. I keep trying to get better, but it's hard and a lack of motivation does not help.
6. I'm financially not doing well. That's not an issue, but my stipend will end before my PhD does, and that fear of the future is terrifying to me.
7. I've lost faith in God. It's like losing a limb. It sucks.
8. I cannot seem to find anyone who I like and who likes me and wants to be with me. I speak of both friends and relationships. I'm literally alone.
9. I'm of no significance to anyone. If I died tomorrow, nobody would even notice. And that's a stupid reason to want to die, but honestly, it makes it harder to want to live.

I'm fully aware that it's depression talking. I'm fully aware that this will pass some day and I'm fully aware that my problems are not that bad. But I haven't stopped crying for the last two days and I'm not even sure I can get through any more. I'm terrified I'll end up doing something to myself and that my animals will have no place to go. But that's the only thing I care about."
18,"can't take it anymore. nobody will miss me but i wrote a note. just about my entire life when 911 finds my body. im done with this world, cana't take it anymore"
19,"fuck me i was in middle of this shit out then i switched apps now i have to type it again fuck.

Why am i such a lazy peice of shit? every time i try to focus on my problems i forget them and watch some youtube cuz i gave adhd idk and idgaf.. wowww now im making excuses for me being a lazy waste of human life. im such a fucking hypocritical whiney peice of shit. i just told myself to shut the fuck up 100 times in the mirror. and now i sound like im victimizing myself... im too self aware thats why every time i cut myself i think im doing it for attention. im fucking done. i say i believe in god and then i dont listen to a single thing he tells me to do and act like he doesnt exist. i cant own up to it. because im a weak fuck. honestly i cant do anything i put my mind to anything i want because of how much of a fucking weak hypocritical loser i am. and dont say i shouldnt think that im a terrible person because i fucking am and if i dont own up to it then i will never grow up. im not gonna ignore the fact that im a weak peice of shit. no one understands me. my dads a peice of shit to my mom. my moms a peice of shit to my dad. i cant do this shit any more. i have to grow some balls and meet my maker."
20,I fucked up and i am bad at life and wish someone would make whats happening to me a situation that will just dissapear.I was depressed already and dont know how I can deal with this now.It feels like i dont have any excape and im seriously thinking of what to do and if this is the end.
21,Time to make the outside fit the inside??
22,"I‚Äôve accepted that I‚Äôll never have any close relationships outside my family and I‚Äôve more or less made peace with that but sometimes the loneliness just hurts so fucking much
All the friends I have are online and while I love them a lot I just wish I had someone physically in front of me who could hold me and tell me I‚Äôm not a bad person and we could just go out and do stupid shit together and I could forget about how much I hate myself for a brief moment and it hurts so fucking much knowing that I‚Äôll never experience that
If there‚Äôs any good from this at least once I finally kms less people will be sad"
23,"I'm too depressed to write a long suicide note. 

I missed out on my teen years I never been asked out to prom nor have I been to any HS parties. (I'm going into my senior year this august) i'm almost an adult and haven't accomplished anything whatsoever. 

I'm also fucking terrible at driving, I can't parallel park for the life of me.

Recently lost my job so there's that. Life can't get any worse than this."
24,"It's been four years since we split up. I think about you every day and every hour. There are days in which not a minute goes by without thinking about you. At first, I was so angry that it felt as if the world was to fall apart. Then it felt like you died in front of my eyes. I often want to tell you how my day was, but you are with someone else now. I've been replaced, repackaged and thrown away. Now, I am not angry and not even sad anymore. I feel empty. Nothing can replace you and when I get home, you're not there. Not a single hug. I cannot recall the odor of your parfum anymore, I cannot remember the spark in your eyes. The spark was long gone when we were still together. You bought a house with someone else. I know you still deeply care about me, but I don't buy anything with it. It feels like the only way I can be forever in your mind, is to kill myself. I cannot do to my family and friends what my heart tells me to do, and here I am. Stuck. I don't live anymore, the day starts and ends. I am either in pain or totally numb, and it feels like I died the day you left me. Silke, I love you more than I hate myself."
25,
26,"I want to start off by saying that I love  my sister and I have no animosity towards her, but her life is so perfect. She got married to a wonderful man, has a gorgeous house and a baby on the way. I've been putting on showers and events for her for the last four years and even thought I'm happy for her I cant help but feel like we are constantly celebrating her.

I just can't help but see what a contrast my life is to my sisters and it makes me feel like such a failure. Its also hard to not compare when you are always planning and shopping for her parties and such. I cant help but feel like life forgot about me. I look like such a fuck up compared to her. She is loved and perfect and I'm over here alone till I'm need for her. I feel like I don't even have my own life; I'm such a supporting character in my sisters life and only here for her.  Its a shitty thing to live with

I just want to know if there's anyone out there that can share their feeling with being the black sheep of the family, even if you aren't really a black sheep in society."
27,"I‚Äôve had the tools to do everything I needed to do in life, (that I didn‚Äôt because I was too weak) available to me. Now that I‚Äôm faced with the exact resources I need to commit suicide, I‚Äôm too weak to do even that. I‚Äôm stuck in a place worse than death where I‚Äôm too hopeless to live, and too cowardly to die. My story isn‚Äôt interesting, I‚Äôm sure many people would have been able to do great in my shoes, but I ruined everything ages ago. I have no talents, I have no friends, my family has given up on me, my day consists of watching anime and listening to music until 5 AM then sleeping until 3."
28,"I'm stuck in my parents' house because of quarantine, and I just realize that there's a rope in their store room and I can hang myself up anytime, especially at night because they are all asleep. I've been itching to do it since forever but I have no access to anything back then."
29,"Realizing that I no longer really care how much my death would fuck people up. I'm just tired of living. Tired of holding up my end of the bargain and being met with nothing in return. This world is shit. Why should I keep living to make other people happy. I'm certainly not living to make myself happy. As far as I'm concerned that's not even possible. I'm pretty chicken shit so I'm not ready to kill myself yet but for the first time I no longer really care if anyone is hurt by my leaving. Honestly I find it quite selfish of people to expect me to continue suffering so they don't have to confront their fear of death. Everybody has to die some day. It's not like it matters. There no greater purpose. You can make your own but it will only ever be real in your own delusions of grandeur. Man's greatest hubris is thinking that they can create purpose. No one's legend is eternal. The sands of time wipe the slate clean eventually. Why stand defiant against them, so we can feign valor for or ""rightous"" fight while we sit on our deathbeds succumbing to the eventual grip of times deathly embrace. For my part I think what would be truly noble is to accept reality and go willingly into the great abyss without fear. IDK, my philosophy is dark and shitty and likely doesn't stand up to scrutiny. This turned into a rant rather suddenly. If I don't stop now I never will."
30,"life just keeps throwing bullshit after bullshit at me and i‚Äôm so done trying to keep up. no one cares. i can‚Äôt really explain it but even around family 24/7 i feel so alone. no one really knows me, even though i‚Äôve tried so much. everyone either leaves or doesn‚Äôt care enough. i‚Äôm done seeking help, nobody cares until you‚Äôre gone. i just wish someone would walk up to me, hold me, tell me they care and they‚Äôll be here for me. but no one will because everyone else is so self absorbed. i spend hours caring about other people, listening to their problems, but as soon as i need help everyone‚Äôs gone. so many other people deserve such a great life and i wish i could give them all a piece of mine and just fade away. fuck this place"
31," I can't take it anymore. This entire year has been a shitshow. My business partner fucked me over before COVID was relevant, the pandemic has canceled my senior year of High School, and now I'm falling for a co-worker who I just know that I have no chance with (hell, I think she already rejected me by rejecting my follow request.). I'm an ugly and useless piece of shit who deserves to be publicly shamed, humiliated, and executed. I plan on ending it all in the near future. I'm sick of being here when everyone I come across ends up hating me. I serve no purpose in this world other than to be God's punching bag and someone who is fun to reject for no reason. There is always something going wrong in my life. I wish to be at peace and killing myself is the only way."
32,Goodbye

34,"I am a Christian k cool we will start with that. 

I was abused by my father when I was 9 years old and verbally abused until 17 

My father finally left when I was 17 making my mom a very very dedicated psycho catholic 

The conflict that I‚Äôve had with her because of that means I have no family relationships anymore 
-         furthermore both Catholic families on both        father and mother side think I should go to hell since I‚Äôm Christian not catholic 

I‚Äôve been depressed since I was 10
I was bullied my whole life
Over the summer leading into my 8th grade year my best friend raped me. 
I was suicidal 8th-12th grade 

I had no friends and I had severe trust issues in everyone

I finally found people who helped me, and got me off the suicide train. By the time they helped me I attempted suicide at least a dozen times and contemplated it every single day. At the time I was an atheist. Those people helped me find God and life was good for a bit. 

Now those same people do things they know trigger ptsd from my past. They would talk about rape in front of me to trigger me. They would say I‚Äôm talking to them for attention despite me trying to make it very abundantly clear that I was trying to find a reason to live
They do things intentionally to make me depressed or suicidal so they have entertainment during this shit show of COVID. Every-time I asked them to stop they apologized to just do it over and over again. I developed a Stockholm syndrome effect with this group because they used to be so good for me, so I allowed myself to keep crawling back to be abused over and over again. 

They made me go from loving God to hating God so much that I wish I was an atheist again. I wouldn‚Äôt even call myself a Christian anymore that‚Äôs how much I hate God, the only reason I still believe is the logical argument behind it. 

With no family, no friends, no religion, no anything please tell me why I should be alive? It would be so much easier to just die and either be dead or go to heaven. What‚Äôs the point in living if you legitimately have no reason to want to live. The typical response on these threads is ‚Äúyour X will still care about you‚Äù but I don‚Äôt have that. I have no one, literally no one everyone in my family tree that‚Äôs alive thinks I‚Äôm going to hell for renouncing Catholicism. I don‚Äôt have any friends to turn to now when I‚Äôm depressed and suicidal. There‚Äôs only one person I can think of that would care if I did off myself, but he would only care because he would have to live with the emotional burden knowing that I killed myself specifically because of him and what he‚Äôs done."
35,"i have one friend and he is in the same mind set as me. he just got out of a super toxic relationship with my ex-best friend and now ive been branded as the school slut even though im only 13. every single one of the girls in my small school of about 70 people hate me and think i stole this girls BF (my friend) and all the boys either think that i want to fuck them or that i want to fuck their friends. i have tried for almost a year to leave this behind me but it just keeps getting worse and worse. my guy friend still loves his ex so i cant say anything to him about her. i know that if i kill myself he might have a chance with her again cause even if he says its not my fault she dumped him i know it really is and if i leave it will just fix the problem. but i also know that if i do then he might kill himself because right now were the only things keeping each other alive and it gets harder and harder each day to protect him. i don't know what to do, i'm becoming more and more numb to what people say and do and i don't know how to stop it. i wont tell anyone in person but i'm scared, im scared im losing myself and i'm going to reach a point where i cant come back."
36,"18 male and recently broke up with my girlfriend, we were dating for almost 2 years. Too some it might seem crazy how I can feel this way, but I really dont know what to do anymore.

It was going well before a couple of days,when she said she was lying about loving me like I did her. She said that she can't be with someone like me anymore, she said the she wants to be the others as well. Well I do sure understand that to some degree, I was shooked that she did not tell me earlier.

I do not wanna do anything anymore, Im feeling suicidal and hopeless of anything, I cant forget all the times we had fun and had an amazing time,and now its nothing anymore.

Does anyone have any advice how to stray away from these feelings and thoughts?"
37,"ive written a really nice suicide note and now i want to do it more. its very pretty sounding, and has quotes and things. im lowkey proud of it. ill probably be gone soon so my parents can read it and finally realize how much pain im in."
38,"Give me a reason, I don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs selfish of me and others suffer, I don‚Äôt want to live at all. Give me a reason to stay alive"
39,"I don‚Äôt enjoy video games anymore.

I don‚Äôt enjoy movies and netflix anymore

I don‚Äôt enjoy anime anymore

I don‚Äôt enjoy le funny quirky memes anymore

I don‚Äôt enjoy junk food anymore 

I don‚Äôt enjoy porn anymore

I don‚Äôt enjoy this website anymore

I want to be fulfilled but I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôll never be. All I do is rot away in my bed alone. Like a dog who knows their time is coming so they go to a quiet and isolated place to die."
40,"Have you ever noticed it? Like something is pressing your lungs, so they can't expand. And when you are trying to do a deep breath, you instantly exhale it back. Like your body intentionally tries to prevent you from breathing. But why it still feels that you need to breathe? Why you can't just stop, if you clearly want to? Why it needs to be so hard and painful? Why you can't just close your eyes and stop breathing, so you will peacefully go to sleep?"
41,"I‚Äôm coming to Reddit as I don‚Äôt know who else to talk to. 

Without going into too much detail, I forced a sexual act on my partner while she was asleep and drunk. I didn‚Äôt see it that way at the time, but the cold sober truth has hit me like a bullet - I raped the person I love most in this world.

She has experienced rape in the past, which only makes it more confusing why I did what I did. Why did I not recognise what I was doing? How could I let myself do that to her? I have no answer for these questions and the pain in her eyes has broken me. 

She hasn‚Äôt left me (yet) but I have left to house for a few days with our children to visit family and give her space (her request). The more time that passes the more the weight of my actions are pressing down on me. I have made it my only goal in life for almost 10 years, to keep her safe and make her happy. In one moment I‚Äôve then gone and broken every value I hold dear and shattered my own perception of who I am. She says she knows I never meant to do anything to hurt her and that she knows I am a good person with a kind heart. But how can that be true? I want more than anything for her to be ok, she has had such a long road to overcome her past traumas. She deserves better than me. My children deserve to have a father they can look up to. I can‚Äôt bear to see them look at me with total adoration knowing what I have done to their mother. 

When we arrived at my Mothers last night I tried to hang myself with a belt in the bathroom. But I couldn‚Äôt do it. I don‚Äôt know if I want to die but I know I can‚Äôt live knowing what I‚Äôve done. There is no way to fix it, nothing I can do to make it right. And the love and adoration of those closest to me feels like a mockery in my heart. She would be better if without me, but if I do kill myself I know that she would blame herself. And what damage would that do to my children...my world. But I just can‚Äôt live with the guilt and pain. I don‚Äôt know who I am, how I could do that. I wish I could just close my eyes and never wake up. I wish I never existed at all. But this isn‚Äôt a dream and my world is falling to pieces before my eyes. I deserve to die, but that would be selfish. I should carry the pain so that others don‚Äôt have to, but I don‚Äôt know if I can. Cutting myself doesn‚Äôt wash away my guilt no matter how much I bleed. I am on the edge of a knife and I don‚Äôt know which way I will fall. I just wish it would all go away!"
42,"I have a loving family and good friends. In the past, I told them about my suicidal and depressive thoughts and for the most part, they have been very supportive. I have drastically improved my grades in school and I am about to graduate community college and transfer to a 4 year school. However, the desire to kill my self still lingers in my mind. 

It just feels like I‚Äôm going to throw myself off a bridge regardless of all the good things happening in my life. I feel like such a burden to everything and everyone and I really think that I‚Äôm better off dead."
43,I wish I was joking
44,"I want to kill myself because everything seems to go wrong. Everyone has an easier life than me, and everywhere I go, I'm being treated like garbage by other women. There is no job that I want to do, which would bring me joy. I just want to die because then, I wouldn't have to worry about this. 

I live alone with my mother, and she has been abusing me consistently. My family talks shit about me or don't reach out to me at all ever since I was a kid. My father is rich, but he never gave me a cent, and I haven't seen him in 10 years. I don't have many friends left, and those who are left, they are not my real friends or have their own life. Every job I start, I'm being abused. I'd like to go to university, but I have no money, and I want to earn money, a lot of money. 

My mother works in a bad place, and she has her own issues with our family and at work. 

I don't know anymore. My last hope is to sell my body, as sad as it sounds. But then, I don't even want to do that. I just feel horrible. I had a bad experience with drugs months ago, and ever since then, my mind seems to go crazy, like I'm bordering on psychosis and not trying to slip from reality. Yesterday night, I couldn't fall asleep and had a paranoia attack, similar to when I was tripping.

And the ironic part is... I don't even hate other people. I would like to have many friends and enjoy life again. I would like to work in a good place and have a happy family. And I would like to travel. But no matter what I do, I feel like everything is failing, and I end up at the same miserable place. Hence why I want to take my own life finally."
45,"I'm turning 22 next week - i'm spending July 4th alone today and I've cried a lot today. My suicidal thoughts started when I was 12, and I get to the point sometimes now where I'm like, really? They're still happening? I get really frustrated with myself because I try to do everything ""right"" and the ""healthy way"". I try exercising. I try eating well. I have a boyfriend I've known since High school. I have friends and a sister who I care about deeply. I am a straight A student in college hoping to go into the psychology field. And yet, this whole time, almost on a near daily basis, I just wish I was dead. It is not obvious on the outside - people think i'm a funny and happy person. I make people laugh and I present myself in a positive way when I'm out. But inside, it just fucking hurts all the time.   


In high school, I called the suicide hotline twice and never told anyone. It helped at the time, the woman stayed on the phone with me for an hour before announcing that she had to go. Therapy has been helpful too, but from my experience, I haven't found a foolproof ""cure"" to not wanting to hurt myself.  I self harmed for years and never told anyone about that either, and even five years later when I no longer hurt myself, the desire to want to die is still there. I am doing things ""right"", but it doesn't seem to matter. 

My freshman year of college I ended up in the hospital due to an illness. I was on bedrest for three months, alone in my room. I couldn't see anyone or talk to anyone. My boyfriend was several hours away at school. I was living with my parents who seemed to make issues worse. All I saw on social media was my 18 year old friends getting drunk and studying abroad. It solidified in my mind that my life was pointless.

I never tell people because I feel like when I used to express suicidal thoughts, they didn't really help me. It's fucking horrible. I've been in therapy for about three years and we talk about my past trauma a lot, but I'm always too afraid to say how hard it is for me because I feel like it's implied. I'm afraid to really be honest with anyone because people can be so judgy and mean.

I know these thoughts stems from my depression, anxiety, and PTSD as a result of an abusive childhood, but knowing the cause doesn't seem to help. All I can use to describe it is immense pain all the time. And obviously, life doesn't help. There's the stress of college, finances, love and lack of it, new trauma, and change. I hate talking to anyone because I feel like I'm constantly complaining, but I also know that I need help. Life is hard. This year alone, I went to two funerals, had to call the police on a roommate who tried to take naked pictures of me underneath my bedroom door, and lived out of suitcase in my boyfriend's room because our college was shut down because of COVID. I lost my job and what little income I had, and being inside for 5 months has increased these thoughts again because I no longer have distractions. This on top of my recurring nightmares and insomnia about my abusive parents has brought me to the point of just wanting it to stop. There is no happiness. There used to be short moments, but now there's nothing.

I guess this is just me venting. I'm so sad that I'm spending another birthday this year wishing that someone else had my life instead of me. I wish I could talk about these thoughts without everyone in my life being dismissive, mean, or weird about them. I get thrown away as a ""sensitive emotional woman with mommy/daddy issues"" when in reality every day I make the choice to keep living. I tell myself I do it for everyone else, but if it came down to it, I'm not sure I would keep myself alive for me. Every day is painful and I wish I could express that to the people close to me without them reacting in a way that hurts me. I wish I could talk about these things without having to make a private reddit account. And I wish I wasn't so fucking alone all the time, and I wish that other people gave a crap. I wish that after ten years I gave a crap about myself too."
46,"It's the logical option. I'd rather be dead than spend 90% of my day daydreaming or sleeping. Everything i want to achieve seems impossible, and even if it id possible, it won't matter anyway. Atleast death is actually something interesting. Don't give me any advice. I don't want to hear it. I'm just saying whats on my mind."
47,i'm useless and a waste of space but at least i finally got the courage to off myself
48,"I completely lost it today, like I'm struggling mentally and I can't stop crying. I pleaded with them to just give me 1 day because I'm exhausted and I need a break. They don't care so I'm done"
49,"Listen, I've tried. Very hard. For years. 
It doesn't get better. If anything it gets worse and worse. 
The universe has decided to screw me over yet again.
My sister is dead, my beloved little sister, the one that came to me every time she had problems. The one that I had to go visit in the hospital every few months every time she attempted to kill herself

And now she's gone.

And I'm fucking pregnant.

Life can't possibly get any worse, but I'm not willing to stick around just to prove it.

This will be my last message. I'm sorry mom that you had to suffer this much. I though I could stick around for you.

But you will learn to live. You are strong. You are loved. 

I'll always be with you. 

Thank you everyone for the amazing support. This time is the last. Ignore this post and go respond to people who still have a chance. Tying my knot right now.

Okay I'm inside. It's kinda hard but I think I did it right.

If I did, goodbye."
50,"It has been a lifetime of mental illness. Treatment resistant. Meds, therapy, the lot. Add autism, add being trans, add being poor and jobless. and not having the language to talk about what I‚Äôm going through, I cannot keep going. I have spent months with only my husband‚Äôs happiness keeping me here. I can‚Äôt continue to only live for someone else‚Äôs happiness. He isn‚Äôt happy. I am a husk. I am a burden. I have drunk myself to hell and relapsed into self harm and I am not able to keep going. I simply don‚Äôt have any other options. I just can‚Äôt continue to be this empty shell. I‚Äôm very sorry."
51,i want to bash my head
52,"I am going to drop out of university. Failed first semester,  terrified me, was behind and then did nothing in the 2nd because I was scared of failure, had no interest in the course and due to corona online classes gave me even less motivation. I know it is all my fault. I am not going to even attempt the exams. The first one would be in 2 weeks and I didn't attend any classes except 2 and didn't study and I can't catch up anyways. 
I don't know what to do. I feel like I have no future anymore. I will never get a job (what job even?), I have no experience and I am scared to not be able to get rid of my apartment and then where can I go? Back to my parents who will kill me? I am going home on Monday to tell them but they won't understand. I feel like the only option is to kill myself since there is no other way. 
I have no idea what to do in the future, my parents won't accept any of it. They wasted money on me going to uni just to fail and I feel guilty and I don't know what to do in the future. But continuing this degree is no option either. I just don't know anymore. I am desperate. How can I make a living?"
53,
54,I‚Äôm finally accepting that the best thing for me to do is just die. I won‚Äôt have to deal with anything anymore and everyone can just forget I ever excited and it‚Äôs a win win for everybody.
55,"I‚Äôve been fighting a war that I can‚Äôt win. Depression, suicide attempts, alcoholism, and compulsive gambling. I took a really hard look in the mirror and realized my time here is coming in an end. No one can talk me out of it this time. My first attempt was a little over two years ago (thanks to my partner at the time screaming ‚Äúfucking kill yourself‚Äù) and I‚Äôm so tired of the pain and loss.

The pain of having a long term partner cheat. The pain of my best friend overdosing. The pain of losing all trust in myself. I can‚Äôt go without a day about thinking about dying.

Once I made the plans and wrote out what I need to do before I go (write letters, clean, make amendments, etc.) I finally felt peace. There‚Äôs a tremendous amount of happiness surrounding the idea that I won‚Äôt be here much longer. Happy tears. It‚Äôs a permanent solution to a permanent problem.

The addict inside me needs to be stopped. The suicide hotline hung up on me. My regular therapist that I‚Äôve been seeing for two years is quitting his practice. My dreams have been crushed. I‚Äôm in debt. This is the final chapter- I‚Äôm done. I‚Äôve fought too long and it‚Äôs time to give up.

I don‚Äôt want to be 25 and already have more relapses than I can count. I‚Äôm done failing. I‚Äôm done disappointing others. I‚Äôm done causing conflicts that could be easily avoidable if I was simply not me. I love everything and everyone, but I truly hate what‚Äôs in the mirror. My mind is constantly persuaded by guilt and hate. The things I do are singular, detached from anything and everyone. There‚Äôs no origin. No one‚Äôs fault but my own. Remember that.

 And with this said, I say goodbye. It‚Äôs a sweet goodbye like a sunset after a long day at the beach. It needs to happen- innately natural, at least to me. I am at peace and I see happiness on the horizon. I am going to feel the love that I‚Äôve always wanted."
56,"I attempted suicide and now stuck on bed cause my leg fractured. I didnt feel grateful surviving it cause the after math is painful. 

  Can someone help me please?"
57,HELP ME HELP ME HELP ME HELP ME HELP ME HELP ME HELP ME HELP ME HELP ME HELP ME HOW THE FUCK DID I END UP HERE AND HOW DO I GET OUT OF THIS
58,"I‚Äôm going to be home alone today, and part of me - actually most of me - knows that it‚Äôs a terrible idea because I have many methods of ending myself in this house, and I‚Äôm the only one who knows that. But I try to think of the things I have that can stop me from doing it. Then I remember that the things I have are so far out of my reach or so far away for me to contact, that I can‚Äôt. In the common sense of the term, I‚Äôm alone in my own space with awful, intrusive thoughts and access to many lethal weapons. A chemical. A knife. A substitute of a rope. Bedsheets. Bathtub. Banister. 

I‚Äôve stopped taking my meds and I‚Äôm tired of waiting for death. I‚Äôm sick and I know it. My physicality is getting worse. My mentality is declining to its lowest brink. My last resort is to tell someone who lives close enough to save me, but nobody that cares about me lives close enough. To die, alone, freezing because of the air conditioner, in pain, depressed, and feeling as if I deserved it. 

It‚Äôs fine. 

I‚Äôm okay with this, now.

I deserve it, so it‚Äôs okay.

I‚Äôve done horrible, irredeemable things. I am unfit for dating or love, everyone I love ends up afraid of me. I‚Äôm unfit for friends, I‚Äôve lost so many because of my broken mental health. My stress has hit its very peak. The stress of thinking of all of the people I‚Äôve hurt because of my actions. 

The people I would still have to this day if I could have simply gotten the help that I needed. 

I won‚Äôt say that I am sorry, for I‚Äôve said it too much for it to do anything for me or anyone else I‚Äôve hurt. Such a numbing phrase. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry‚Äù.

I‚Äôm not. 

If I really were, then I wouldn‚Äôt hurt people as easily as I do.

But I do, and now where has that gotten me. 

I‚Äôm tired of living, and I want this to be the end of me."
59,"I decided im not gonna kill myself. but im gonna feel all this pain in life so i'm more prepared for when i burn in hell. Thats what life is. hell. Lmao why tf was I religious, thats the dumbest thing i've done in my whole life. What a joke life. I so badly want to kill myself though. All the damn time i'm wanting to just fucking off myself in horrible painful ways. Its such a strong damn urge, so i do wonder how long i will really last. I hope hell is real."
60,This is my second post on this sub. I keep trying to be a better boyfriend but even though my girlfriend tells me I am a great boyfriend I feel like a waste of space. I have my next therapy appointment in 4 weeks but I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm gonna make it that long. I hate everything about myself. So if I can‚Äôt even love myself why should anyone else. I despise waking up in the morning just so I have to look at myself in the mirror and be reminded of the waste of oxygen that lies before me. I just want a break from life and the longest break I can think of is death. I want to feel something anything.
61,paramedics are gonna have a laugh at that when they find my dead body next week
62,
63,"Please can someone have some sort of answer for me. I have tried again and again to end my life but for some reason I'm so fucking bad at it. I don't understand why it won't work. Is it my unconscious self stopping myself because me consciously right now wants to be dead? I have genuinely tried. Genuinely. Like really genuinely. Wrote the note, cried my fucking eyes out and tried to do it. I've tried to cut my wrists but I couldn't get it deep enough or in the right place. I've tried to to strangle myself again and again. I've even tried to hang myself but it just won't work. Why? I am so tired. Both physically and mentally. Good people die every day. People who want to live life and have dreams and here I am. Who wants to die but can't seem to die. I want to end my life. So why won't it work?"
64,"Iv been depressed for many years on and off. Past few months it wont leave, i have lost my partner in the most brutal way, lost my family my kids and everything i have. I am a shell of my former self. 

I have come to the realisation that i will never be happy. I will never have the family and the love i have always craved. I keep questioning why others have people who love them and stay together for life while i get brutally fucked over by the people i love the most. 

I cant take it anymore. I am alone, and will be alone forever. 
My friends are not really that close, my parents have never liked me or made effort and the woman i loved for so long and gave everything i had to wouldnt care if i lived or died (she actually said this). 

I find no joy or happiness in anything any more. I dont feel any love or kindness from anyone. This world has chewed me up and spat me out more than once. I have been knocked time an time again. I kept getting back up like they tell you too but not this time. 

Im circling the drain of death, if i didnt have 3 children who would be hurt by my passing i would of already gone. 

Last ditch attempt of counseling and medication. Im thinking of setting a date. Say 6 months from now. I know time is a healer and i will feel better in time. However if things havnt drastically improved within 6 months i think its time.  

Anyone else ever set a end state timer?"
65,"My boyfriend and I have been together for a year and a half, and just recently i started understanding the suicidal tendencies that can take over him. This is something new to me as i‚Äôve never dealt with anything like this before. He explained to me that this runs in his families mental health, and it worries me that he can cut himself and want to die occasionally when times get tough. I just want to make him feel that i am here for him, and to get through this together with him because he deserves that. Any advice as to what i can say/do to show my support and that im here through everything??"
66,"I'm going to kill myself in less than an hour. I used to cry my eyes out at my misery. But now I feel nothing, because I know I'm going to die. It's almost like a sense of relief. I used to be so scared of upsetting my parents, but I don't even care anymore. Part of me feels like I should be remorseful, but there's nothing. I just wanna die. It's the only way out."
67,"I just don't think I can do this anymore. I'm sorry I've failed everyone. I just can't keep fighting anymore. I've lost. I'm such a horrible, horrible person. I just wanna end it so nobody will have to be cursed with my presence any longer.

No matter what I do, I'll always be at death's door. I don't think I'll ever change. Because I am weak-minded and not courageous enough to get better. So I'll just do the next best thing. I'll end my life. Nobody cares about me anyway, they'll only care about me after I'm dead. So I'll give them what they want."
68," Mental health is not a battle to be won, it's a journey to continue walking. Be kind to your mind and let yourself feel.

70,"I didn't think that was possible. I already had a suicide plan and was determined to go through with it. The last days of my life had a certain freedom to it, I wanted to live my life with my friend and savor these last moments. My birthday is coming up in a few days, turning 19. And yet, I can't see myself enjoying myself at all anymore. I can't listen to music anymore, which was really my only closure. I used to love prog and jazz and fusion and all these different talented artists. But now I can't even fathom how I'm supposed to even go through with my plans, which involve renting a place. My parents aren't good, they aren't bad either. But however they may be they don't deserve to see their child lying dead in his room. I just wonder if I'm gonna even have the will to kill myself anymore. that sounds good on paper, but I guess it's only a matter of time before I muster the last of my strength to talk to people and get shit done.

72,"Alright, so one of my friends (still a minor) has told me about his depression and anxiety and sometimes he gets huge mental breakdowns/panic attacks where he starts venting. For now, all I have done is regularly talked to him about his depression and tried to calm him down during these breakdowns.

He has also told me that he has not told his parents about his depression out of fear of them worrying. He has also mentioned how his depression isn't even that big (even if it is very clear that it is) and that he wouldn't want to take the spot of someone who needs it more.

It has come to a point where I feel like I NEED to tell his parents about this. His parents need to know and they need to get him to a professional as soon as possible, wether he likes it or not.

I need some advice.  
Do I ""betray"" his trust and tell his parents? Or do I try and continue what I have been doing so far?"

74,"Not really a suicidal post, but i definitely don't know where to go from here.

I will do it at some point, haven't really thought out when yet.

&#x200B;

without further ado the explanation as to why;

&#x200B;

I feel like everything, has come to the worst definitive outcome of my life.

And somehow i wished for it to happen at one point but then, when i mostly needed everything came true?

&#x200B;

The pent of feelings i had as a teenager;

&#x200B;

I wished for my father to die, because i was so stuck up with him.

I wished to never fall in love, because i didn't deserve it.

I wished to be damned, like a religion, because of the way i was treated around with my friends.

&#x200B;

For a while i thought; these were just the feelings i had as a child since i was naive.

Since my father, did love me.

He was in fact the only person who cared so deeply. 

And i can only see that now.

&#x200B;

I falled in love; with a girl over the summer after my father died.

Then i got cheated on, and the worst part she never acknowledged it.

Knowing i could handle it, as i was open for her having open relationships. 

&#x200B;

All these 2; came into my own damnation like a religion, my friends came to believe my side of the story.

But also due to that, they never saw me as the same thing anymore.

&#x200B;

Every day seems like a struggle; and i do smile, i do laugh.

But deep inside; i'm crying.

&#x200B;

I refused to give up before, and i'm still doing that, i just don't know for how long.

Till i finally collapse.

&#x200B;

To top this whole story off, i hate racism.

I loathe people who hate one another just because of a color,race or what other people did.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

And with that said, my mom got a new boyfriend who, is exactly like that.

He works in a prison, but he hates and loathes about race so so much.

I can't listen to him; and yet i do.

Because i can't cause drama/i won't.

It's because i also hate drama.

I don't like it, neither does me writing this whole story like what i just wrote.

But, sometimes you just have to, write your own feelings out.

&#x200B;

I want to move out,

Away from all this.

&#x200B;

But i know this project will take another 2 years before i finally move out of the house.

&#x200B;

Then is the question then what, what do i do when i moved out. 

&#x200B;

Maybe that will resolve itself,

I just hope it doesn't involve in me; going into spirals again.

That's just the scary part off it all."
75,"This feeling of indifference towards everything in life is growing bigger and becoming more justifiable each day and I just don‚Äôt want to do this anymore.

I tried to end it all 3 years ago but it backfired and got me into loads of troubles with my family.. If only it worked.. I wish I had the courage to find a way to end it, no matter how brutal, just get it done with for good.

76,"My plan is to buy 2, connect them and then attach a tube to one. I'll put the tube into a plastic bag and tie the bag to my head.

77,"It was already looking friendly when the world started going to hell but with the fact my mom and I are gonna be evicted from our house at the end of the month. We have no money or time to pack up, find a place and move into a new place (especially with trying to find a temporary place for our birds to stay until we get settled) and ya know... We're in the middle of a damn pandemic and my mom is in the category of high risk for covid. 

Before anyone asks our landlord waited until our states restrictions on evictions was lifted (which was on the first) before hitting us with the eviction notice. 

After I went through the rapid wave if emotions, crying my eyes out and just laying in bed for several hours straight, my brain just emotionally shut down. For the last few years I've been just chugging along, clinging to hope that things will at least stay stable and I could focus on my goals of being an artist. But now I feel nothing. I spent time with bf and I just faked a smile to seem fine but I just couldn't bring myself to find happiness which I know isn't fair to him.
Mom and I have been through a lot of shit and have scrapped by by the skin of our teeth but I just don't see how we can possibly pull through this. 

I've been contemplating swallowing all of my pills, taking enough meletonin to put myself to sleep and hope I just go in my sleep. I know the chances of success are slim but better then my other plan which is stop drinking and eating or to just yeet myself off the overpass. 

Am I selfish and a coward for wanting to die, yes but I'm just tired of fighting against the world only to get pushed down and spit on. I know mom will be devastated as will my friends and other loved ones (mom especially since my older sister passed away a couple years ago) but hopefully they'll understand that I'm weak and just can't keep going anymore just to be a burden on them. 

I know some are going to see this as a me wanting to be convinced to live but honestly I mostly wrote this for catharsis (if that's the right word) and to hold myself accountable if I chicken out.

Thanks for reading."

79,"I saw a starter pack about a ""narcissistic mother"" and now I feel the pressure to lose all of my weight, get plastic surgery and wear revealing clothes by 25 so I don't fit into the stereotype after 25.

I want to be the friendly 40 year old who doesn't care about looks and has tons of beautiful pictures of their youth to show people, not the vain narcissistic excuse for a human who still wears smaller sizes and shows her arms and has long hair because she was huge and ugly in her youth and wants to make up for it.

I just want to be a UK size 4-6, wear very little clothing and get surgery before it is too late and I am no longer considered a human for caring about my looks.  Time is ticking and if I don't look decent NOW, I'll have the choice between turning into a vain narcissistic subhuman freak or a fat old ugly person with no memories of their youth to share."
80,"Currently sitting outside on my balcony, in one of the Chairs.  

Probably about a 15 foot drop onto my patio, if I climb up onto one of the railings. Considering taking a head dive off right now. 

I was talking with my therapist yesterday about how I‚Äôve been feeling. He wants me to go back to the hospital but I hate going. I find it a waste of time tbh.

I‚Äôve been texting crisis lines on and off for the last few days in addition to checking in with my therapist. 
Also been using a lot of coping skills and distraction to try and take my mind of suicide. 

Any advice on what I should maybe do would be appreciated. I know that I should call someone right now for help, but I honestly don‚Äôt have the guts."
81,My wife of thirteen years kicked me out and whats a divorce. I lost everything and am now living in trash room across town. I can inly see our children when she allows me to. She told me I disgust her. I have dealt with depression for years and have been trying everything to change but she wont try. I have dreams/ nightmares every night. Her and my kids were the only happiness I had in life. I cant see pife without her and she tells me Im being selfish. I just want the pain to stop. I am utterly alone everyday after I get off work. Everything is dull. Is it selfish to not want to wake up? Ive been doing this for three months and it hasnt gotten any better.
82,"My whole life I think has been tracking toward suicide.   It‚Äôs like there‚Äôs never been any escape.  People told me it was going to get better.  I didn‚Äôt believe them.  But I always loved the scientific method - prove yourself right by trying and not being able to yourself wrong.  

I had nothing to lose, I took big risks and fought like hell.  

I‚Äôm on medications now that I swore I‚Äôd never take, and guess what?   My depression appears to be treatment resistant.  

The gave me adderall and it keeps me awake - I plotted out all the things I‚Äôd have to do to get my life back on track and it‚Äôs more than I can get done in the next few months. 

That‚Äôs not even counting work (which I have to do), free time, things I wanted to accomplish, etc.

Anyway, I‚Äôm convinced it‚Äôs hopeless.  There appears to be no reasonable escape. 

In the next two months I can go get TMS, I can get EMDR, I can stay on my medications, but after all that then what?

My job environment sucks, my dream career has been derailed, the girl I loved left and I don‚Äôt want anything else.  I don‚Äôt even want to get better.  My therapist struggled to be polite when I said I didn‚Äôt want to be happy.  How am I going to achieve anything in therapy if there‚Äôs nothing I want to improve?

I liked who I was, I liked how strong and smart I became dealing with impossible situations.   But I‚Äôm miserable.  Nothing will remove the lifetime of bad experiences I‚Äôve had.

Anyway, it‚Äôs like I‚Äôve had greater things things and opportunities than I‚Äôll have again in my lifetime.  For sure.  And I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôd keep fighting for anything anymore.  I miss the girl who left me.  Period.  As I get older I realize there are fewer and fewer people I‚Äôd like to spend my time with.  And if my seemingly great relationship with her ended, then either I‚Äôm a fool or a loser.

I just really have nothing to look forward to.  I have tried so much already.   I don‚Äôt want to change myself bc myself has been forged through crucibles of trauma and I like who I became.  I like myself.  But I am miserable.  I am done with it.  It‚Äôs clear to me I don‚Äôt have enough control over things.  I don‚Äôt have enough energy.  My health is failing.  Everyone has left me.  I‚Äôm done living a life of misery."

But you have to have lived there for 12 months and I don't have 12 more months in me, and it also has to be for a terminal illness. Anyone reckon a petition is a good start?

Why am I even bothering to write this?? Maybe I feel less lonely when I do so.. I'm sorry. 

I wake up everyday wishing I sleep more... I wait for the day to end so I can sleep more.

I've lost all my ambitions and I'm emotionless. I still care about my loved ones and friends but I'm not strong enough to keep going.

I'm trying to get the courage to end my life. I want to end my life next month. How? I still don't know.

I'd like a painless method but such is impossible.

God! I hate myself so much... I just want to leave."
88,"As the tittle said, I tried to kill myself yesterday. I took a handful of all the pills I had in my room, and took them all. 

I was woken up by my parents later that evening, and rushed to A&E; and now I‚Äôm here, unsure what to do. 

I regret it completely- seeing the effect it had in the people around me, I am lost for words. It‚Äôs not that I didn‚Äôt think they would care, I just didn‚Äôt realise the effect it would have. 

The issue is, what do I do now. My girlfriend downs t know what to do, my parents are out of their depth, and I am just as confused as I was 24hours ago."
89,"I'm 24, moved to nyc (my favorite place in the world) in the best neighborhood and have the most fascinating roommate. I'm healthy, somewhat intelligent, have a sought after degree, make a decent salary, and basically have the foundation and means necessary to have a great life and work towards an incredible life.

Only problem is that I hate myself and have no energy or will to do anything. I dislike nearly everything about myself from the way I look - the way I speak - the way I work - the way I interact with people. There was a time where I was outgoing, tried really hard in school and with my hobbies, and actively made an effort - but i'm the completely opposite now.

I don't have many good friends because I alienate myself and believe if someone is being friendly and wants to hang out with me - they're either just doing it as a charity or they'll just be disappointed and find out i'm not who they thought i was. I never speak up because I think everything I say is dumb or just not worth saying, I don't find myself interesting at all, and I always immediately assume I'm the least valuable person in a room and am automatically below everyone. I'm very lonely and hold myself back in every single way. I overthink and criticize EVERYTHING I do and any decision I make. I just want to feel and think normally, and not be so in my head. I know life has it's ups and downs and i've had a positive outlook through it all but i'm absolutely exhausted now even though my life is just getting started.

I've tried to make efforts to better myself and at least somewhat like myself by speaking to a doctor - was diagnosed with ADHD and Depression and have been taking mediation for about a year - but there's not much improvement. I work out and try to push myself to gain new experiences but feel so awkward in my own skin and mind. I even feel awkward talking to my doctor (who is absolutely wonderful btw) but always hold back and don't mention how I feel suicidal on a weekly basis, that I genuinely don't like myself, that i'm miserable, and hide all that by talking about my frustrations with my work ethic and motivation.

I'm in my 20s and want to take FULL advantage of this time in myself, but it's so difficult to when I feel cemented to my bed and wish I could go to sleep and never wake up.

Often times I truly believe I'm not cut out for life and would be better suited as an observer and watch others make the best of their lives instead of me. What would I be like when I'm older? Apparently I'm great at my job but feel like I'm terrible at it and have no motivation to improve even when my mind is yelling at me to, so how could I handle being promoted and move up when I feel too dumb to manage people or command a room or feel confident in my work? How could I be in a relationship when I believe a man of high-value would be absolutely insane to even like me enough to commit to me? How could I make life-long friends when I alienate everyone? How can I take care of children or even a pet when I'm too exhausted to take care of myself? Etc. etc.

Anybody else in a similar position?"

93,"A part of me often hopes that I'll get some incurable illness or be involved in some accident where I'll die quickly. Then I'd be able to finally escape this pain and not have to feel guilty about deliberately killing myself.

I sometimes fantasize about getting a diagnosis of terminal cancer or something, so that I will finally be at peace."

28k in debt.

No job due to Covid-19. Also quit a career job 7 year years ago to be a full time care giver for my parents who died in 2017/2019 from COPD and Throat cancer.

No unemployment, health/dental insurance.

No savings.

28K in student loan debt...  I have paid 40K. Still only growing with Income Based Repayments.  I pay 20 a month and gain 166 a month in interest.

I have no children, no pets, and no debt outside student loans.

I am blind in one eye, and have other health problems, none qualify for any kind of Government help.

Eating  a  1oz slug seems to be the answer.

I have no family left, no money, no hope.

I am fucking tired, no one gives a fuck about what I am going thru, especially my dad, I've seen 2 psychiatrist, one I stopped seeing for some reasons, and the 2nd one just misdiagnosed me at first then give me antipsychotics that made my symptoms and gave me bad side effects like hallucinating, luckily I stopped immediately cold turkey, but it was followed by a week of hell.

After that my dad have came to a conclusion that no one will gonna treat me and that every doctors out there is the same and it's up to me to help myself, I've tried, I did fucking tried, I meditate 2x a day, exposed myself, exercise all this kind of shit but my mind is keep fucking with me, maybe my chemicals and neurons are not normal out there, and need some serious rewiring. My mom understands my pain but she can't fucking do anything because she has no money and my dad has our family's possession.

My anxiety and depression took away everything from me, my passion, my friends, my social life, my love at learning things, and my happiness overall, and my personality and sense of self. I am tired, I feel hopeless, I am trying everything I can do but it's not enough, been bullied by people whole my childhood, been abused mentally and emotionally for 2 years by my own relatives, living in a third world country where I am an outcast, and my dad is neglecting us, man fuck you life give me a fucking break, I think life is not meant for me, I used to love learning and love life itself, but now, I became a depressed, boring, loner, and maybe a loser that no one gives a shit about. I think suicide is the only option, I don't know man. The fuck is the purpose of life if you can't feel pleasure or rarely feel emotion besides sadness, emptiness, and anxiety. Fuck this shit man."

I've struggled the past couple of years working towards a trade I dont really want, dealing with the fact I have 0 relationship experience and kinda just wanting to isolate myself and just play on my PC at home after work. I'm also afraid to go for a walk outside my house or in my local town in case of being seen by old friends or people I used to know because I feel embarrassed/full of shame/guilt/anxious. 
I'm the eldest and have to set an example in my family and I absolutely love my younger siblings/parents and our dog. 
But I just cant shake the feeling that I'm just going to keep struggling on for however much longer before I most likely end it all myself. 
Been on lexapro for 2.5 years and all it has done has suppressed my feelings just so I can get through a days work. It mutes my mind of the depressive thoughts but in return I'm a lifeless zombie.

104,"I'm technically still enrolled as a uni student, but i haven't gone to uni nor did my final research for the last 6 months. Rn i'm just at home doing anything i can to 'have fun' at home. I was born a loner anyway so i don't get even more depressed by staying at home and becoming anti-social. (I have been ignoring my friends & other ppl's messages). I ran out of things to do so why not write this anyway. I'm going to rant A HELL LOT so it's going to be a long long story. Again, because writing this takes a lot of time, and i need to kill a lot of time. Here's the TL;DR. Anyway it's just a rant as a replacement for not being able to open up to anyone. Maybe it can be an interesting story for those needing inspiration or smth. It's a little step for feeling a little better, so why not. Not that i'll stop being a NEET.

**TL;DR:** I was doing great at uni but out of nowhere i became depressed. Struggled and struggled for 2+ years, tried almost everything, but my depression only got worse. Seriously attempted suicide without getting caught/leave marks. Wanted to tried a better method but then quarantine came. Afraid of getting caught, now i'm a NEET. After becoming much calmer as a NEET, decided to wait for myself to die naturally or wait 1-2 years until i can't take it anymore and kill myself. Already given up on recovering / getting on with life, it'll only get  me even more depressed and i'll kill myself earlier. Why did i became depressed? It's probably a multi-factorial thing + some genetics. I'm just out of luck. I'm not going back.

\-------

**Edit**: ha, i don't want anyone i know recognize me from my 'highly specific' rant so i deleted the long long rant. leaving only the afterthought behind. still, it felt good writing them down, killed lots of time... no i didn't cried writing this lol. Here it is:

(after struggling & struggling, cancelled my suicide plan)... So then i opted for the second best option, becoming a NEET.

I felt a big relieve, honestly. I was happy because i didn't cried for days straight. Only cried a little once a week or two. Of course this is not the perfect solution. I did everything i could to distract myself, to enjoy my 'new life'. Well, things to do are running out. No matter how i run away from it, a depressed person will always lose interest at anything eventually. I honestly thought it was better for me to become a game/anime/porn addict. tried to become one, but of course i failed. So what i'm going to do is to wait for the time to either die naturally or for the depression to catch up to me to the point of suicide. I guess the later will come first in 1-2 years. these 6 months already feels like more than a year.

I am NOT going to try therapy & to get going again. I'm sick of the medication, it only made me worse and gave me bad tremors. Although i can look for another psychiatrist, i honestly don't want to struggle anymore. Struggling makes me very tired emotionally, and that will worsen my depression. I'm not going to try opening up to anyone either, i'm tired of trying to do that. i will explain this a little more below. In one word, i don't want to cry and struggle anymore. If there'll be a time i want to give up so bad, i want to just give up and be done with it. Time will tell wether i'll really give up or not, but the time is not now. well again, if i don't give up i'll probably stay as a NEET and die as one.

Oh, did i mention that i choke myself? Cutting is a no-no for me. It leaves scars, a big red flag. Not that i didn't tried, but i don't like the pain/sensation either way. Before i find choking myself the best, i hit my head to the floor.

For those who are curious on what causing my problems here, i already thought a decent hypothesis. I suspect that my mom had a depression in her mid 20s-30s, so my problem could be partly genetics. I mentioned that i tried so hard to open up myself to a friend/family, but i just can't. Looking back, there's always a wall that i keep up even with my trusted friends. I'm everybody's friend but never someone's best best friend. I always put a mask, wether i want to or not. And in all honesty, i don't really care about them either even if they died. Yes, that probably applies for my parents too. So i just happen to have a bad personality. Me being busy at uni was not helping my condition either. Although it was my choice, i didn't know i was depressed so tough luck for me. I once checked for thyroid hormones but they came back normal so that's not the answer. My period is always regular so it's not gonodal hormones / cyst either. Brain tumour? haha either that or that the combination of bad genetics, bad personalities, and unlucky circumstances is what has driven me crazy. Depression is like cancer, you know? it's multifactorial, caused by god knows how many possible mechanisms.

One regret i have is that i didn't get to finish my studies before breaking down like this. I thought i could at least get to submit my thesis and be done with it for the rest of my life. Didn't even plan to attend the graduation. I wanted to get out from society without any 'debts' left, a clean cut. People just gradually forgot about me because i have nothing to do with them again and so are they. Well, that didn't happen, sh≈çganai. can't be helped. I'm not going back."
105,"I have been feeling bad, seeing how the persons who I considered my friends do not care about me, do not text me, just look for me when they need something from me, that is breaking me out. Nobody has talked to me for 4 days, and it may seem like a few time, but is an eternity. Actually, I wanted to talk with anybody, but I have a headache so having this phone in front of my eyes hurt as much as this loneliness."
106,
107,"And no, none of you count. No offense but, you know what I mean.

But the loneliness is on both sides of the issue, I can't keep burdening people with this shit every damn day. They don't feel the weight every day. They think they hear me once and we should be good, that's how it works in their brain so it must work the same way in mine?

No, the weight tumbles down the hill again every damn day. And nobody wants to stick around for it. Again and again. Not even me."

Most of the time I will just talk to my friend and if he doesn't respond I start getting worried because he is also depressed when I'm not talking to him i will watch anime or cartoons or watch YouTube to make myself feel happy and eat food. And it doesn't help that I'm a furry too"
111,"It's like I drowning and barely can keep my head above the water, like I am stuck in molasses.

I don't want to die but I can't do it anymore."
112,"I guess I'm still not in danger, because I thought when you're really in danger and you have a plan, you get a feeling of peace. At least I have some peace in the sense that, if I do get to where I can't think of any way not to go through with it, I've set out a couple of rules for myself to make the best of it. Like, I know where I'd do it, to make sure my kids aren't at risk of finding me. I'm finally drunk enough to stop fucking crying for the first time in... 14 hours now, looks like. Nothing's going to make this better. I'm in therapy. I'm on meds. My spouse is super supportive and I have literally everything to live for. And still here I am, thinking about how I'll make sure my kids have someone to look to when I'm gone. This is the only place I can say anything, because when I do make an attempt, I'm too careful to make a cry for help or try something that might not work. If it gets to that, nobody's going to know until I'm gone.

Just like when I called the suicide hotline 20 years ago, when I first had thoughts of dying, and I just sobbed that it was stupid of me to call because I was probably fine and they said okay. I'm way too self-controlled to say something like this if I were actually about to do something; I'd just do it. I'm so fucking tired of not being sick enough.

I'm not even looking for help. I can't imagine what anybody could do and I never get responses from anybody, anywhere. I just get more and more isolated as time goes on, the harder I work to face my fears and reach out. It's just that I don't have anybody else who understands. The people who care about me worry too much and my psychiatrist and therapist worry too little. I've never fit and I'm never going to."

120,"Okay so to preface this is in no way sexual, it‚Äôs purely just a form of escapism that has developed for me the last few days or so. I‚Äôm posting this wondering if anyone else can relate to this. 

Lately I‚Äôve started getting deep into this fantasy of inciting my own murder. I imagine how I would find someone to do it, what they would look like, how they would do it, etc. Like today I‚Äôve been thinking about a timeline where I post on reddit somewhere inciting for someone to kill me. They contact me and I tell them that I want to be shot point blank from behind while I‚Äôm walking somewhere. We pick the date and the location and discuss what to do with my body. I‚Äôve been constantly thinking about a way I can escape all this pain I‚Äôm in all the time and it‚Äôs gotten to the point where the thought of someone murdering me is more comforting than the thought of having to live any longer. I feel like everything in my life is telling me that I should die. I‚Äôm considering going to this bridge that goes over the river in my city, it‚Äôs very high up. I want to just sit on the edge at the top of it and look at the water and feel how high up I am. The thought of that is also comforting. If I felt like it I could just jump off and it would all be over. If I got drunk and went up there I know I would do it. I have no doubt. I guess I‚Äôm just conflicted. I‚Äôm still trying to hold onto hope but I don‚Äôt think I can ever really get better. I feel like my issues are too ingrained and there‚Äôs too many. Even if I could fix them do I have it in me to work that hard for that long? I hate myself so deeply I don‚Äôt even think I deserve to feel better if I‚Äôm honest. I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm talking about anymore. This post went on a complete tangent.

I'm just so bored all the time and I can never achieve the things that I set out to accomplish. I've tried therapy and medication but nothing works.

I‚Äôve considered an abortion so my baby doesn‚Äôt have to go through split up, young parents and a mom with issues. But I love them so much already I won‚Äôt be able to live with myself if I have an abortion. My bf insist I get one to avoid him paying childcare (  don‚Äôt want him to either to but it‚Äôs the law) or I decide on having the baby and giving to him not being a mom for them and constantly going through seeing my bf live a happy life with a new family when I know he‚Äôs my soulmate. My kid will love his dad way more than me and they‚Äôll all probably move on from me and I‚Äôll be that messed up mom that everyone that‚Äôs about and is never there for her child. My bf is moving out tomorrow. I think it‚Äôs time.. I‚Äôm going to have to have an abortion and just end it all afterwards.. I‚Äôm so sorry to my family, I‚Äôm disappointed in how everything is turning out. I love my family, boyfriend and baby all endlessly but I can‚Äôt live with the loss of my baby and boyfriend who I know is the one in one year, it‚Äôs disappointing with how my first pregnancy went and a relationship where I know 100% that he‚Äôs the best for me and such an amazing guy.. I‚Äôm sorry"
127,"I keep looking back on my life, and I can't help but feel like the universe is trying to kill me.

Literally from the moment I was born, I had a breathing issue that had to be dealt with. Less than a year later, I got a very bad case of the flu and had to get hospitalized. A few years ago, I slipped on something (still no idea what the fuck it was), hit my head, and could've bled out if the doctor hadn't hurried the fuck up.

I'm also being driven to suicide by bullshit that's not my fault. I'm bisexual, so of course both of my parents seem to be biphobic. I've been to four different schools, two of which have consisted of mostly bullies and homophobes. At one of my schools, even the teachers hated me even though I was a well behaved student. It also doesn't help that I'm autistic, so going through all of this shit while only being able to keep one friend is tough.

On the topic of my one friend, for literally no reason, I've just lost all interest in talking to him. I like him and he's really nice, I just lost interest for no reason. Then that makes me feel lonely, and I feel horrible for not wanting to talk to him, which makes me even more depressed and even closer to suicide.

There are only two things that have stopped me from suicide. One is my cat, one of the few beings on this planet who actually fucking cares about me. The other is just a lack of planning. I don't know how I would even do it.

If the universe is out to kill me, can it please hurry? I want to fall asleep tonight and never wake up. That would literally be the best thing to ever happen to me. If I died tonight, my one friend and my cat would be upset. Everyone else would get over it within 2 weeks I feel like."
128,"Bullshit. 

You can't depend on anyone. Friends, family, no one. 

When I'm gone, only like 3 people will care. 

Why do I try?

It's been a rough week and today might have broken me. If I do it it'll be before days end. About 4 hours. 

Only thing stopping me is that I'm a fucking pussy like always. Don't have the heart to stay, don't have the balls to go. I wish someone would just end me. Just sneak up no warning and just turn off the fucking lights. 

I quit and I'm sick of pretending I haven't quit. I was born a mistake, I've lived through nothing but mistakes, and the smart money says all I have left to look forward to is monotonous misery. Why bother?"
129,I‚Äôve already been without for a couple. I feel dizzy and tired and awful. It‚Äôs really not helping my already fragile state. I just really need support right now to keep going. I‚Äôm just waiting for my already suicidal thoughts to go haywire as my body already is going crazy. I‚Äôm already in such a dark place in my life and this was absolutely the worst time for me to run out and the pharmacy/doctors to be fucking up. Fuck this!!!
130,"My life is a big mess my emotions are always messed up. Ive been in love so many times but never ones has those feeling been returned. Even when i better myself like smile more often or workout, study or i act on my own beliefs nothing fucking works. Theres always something weong with me that peopla have to point out. I get to cocky i talk too much i have lame jokes i have no experience with mostly nothing. Ive been suicidal before but i think that my last minutes are counted and this time i will make sure i press that knife in all the way."
131,"i wish I never existed, cuz then on the off chance that somebody cared for me, they wouldn‚Äôt be sad or annoyed cuz they‚Äôd never have known. i wish I wasn‚Äôt born, or born as a dog. I‚Äôm 14M and indian. I‚Äôve been suicidal since I was 10-ish. I just can‚Äôt do this anymore. I wanna disappear off of the face this planet, someone pls end me, pls:)"
132,"I posted here 12 days ago but I wasnt really successful with my suicide. Turns out stabbing is hard. Last June 3 my uncle (the one sponsoring my college) found out I didn't enroll. He told my grandma who told my mom. My mom was so angry and she beat me up and she said she was so ashamed she wished I were dead. I took it by heart and I was at my lowest at that time. By midnight I was gonna kill myself but I fell asleep. June 4, 4:00 am I went to the woods to stab myself but I was such a coward, it was really hard for me to do it and pieces of advice I got from reddit especially from a friend named David just went to my head. By 6 am I got up and went home telling myself things will get better. 12 pm my dad called (he only goes home by fridays to weekends) because he heard the news from my aunt (istg my relatives are all under our noses) so my dad called me saying that he was so angry I should pack up and runaway. I begged him I dont want to. By 2pm he was coming home so I picked up the kitchen knives and ran away to the woods. I was hiding there and I was planning to stab my neck by nighttime. I was just so confused; I wasnt angry, I wasn't sad. I felt empty and in pain and I just wanted to die. I heard shuffling footsteps by 5 pm and voila my mom found me. I was just so scared she was shouting at me to go home and face my dad. She got this big chunk of wood she beat me up till we got home. (idk how she found me tho) So I got home, faced my dad, and behold the most amazing man I will ever see. He listened to me and sympathized with me. He told me I should've told him about my problems because my mind is still very vulnerable and young. I didn't tell him about how suicidal I am. My mental state is still a sham to Filipino families. The only thing he didnt like about what I did was how this would bring shame to my fam since we are poor and my siblings' education lies on the judgemental hands of my rich relatives.  Anyways he told me I should just get a job within two months to help with the financial problems. My only problem right now is how to face my uncle and all the relatives who would be saying Im an ungrateful, good for nothing, eldest daughter who dropped out from an oh so amazing career, with that private expensive prestigious med school. Anyways right now I feel at peace that my dad (and my mom kinda) is warming up to accepting my decisions. All there's left to do is to not regret the consequences of my actions. The lingering feeling of killing myself is still there. Hopefully I don't feel too suicidal again in the future."
133,That's all. Pretty much done trying but whatever. I'll give it a go.
134,"TW self harm??

Hour by hour I can feel myself slipping. I have almost no hope left. I don‚Äôt talk to anyone at all, haven‚Äôt for a week, it‚Äôs just been me, a game and my thoughts. For me, there is no help. No medicine, no therapy is going to bring back what I lost. I can‚Äôt fight anymore. I‚Äôm so tired of holding on. I don‚Äôt even know if I should wait another day, to see if the person I love will come back, or a few days until my mail comes, or just do it now in the dead of night. Nobody awake, nobody to help or to see me, hear me. I don‚Äôt want to be alive, just to suffer like this. I think in at most a week I‚Äôll be dead. I sh every night to get my pain tolerance higher just so eventually I can do enough to stop the suffering. Sometimes I don‚Äôt even want to. Don‚Äôt want to feel the pain but I force myself to just so I can get used to it. The thought of putting more scars onto my body doesn‚Äôt even come across my mind when I do it. I can‚Äôt even care that even if I survive this huge ass tremor, I‚Äôll have permanently ruined my body. I‚Äôm sorry if venting like this is against the rules. I do not have anyone to go to. Nothing helps...it‚Äôs 5 in the morning and I‚Äôm bawling my eyes out with a razor in my hand and the full power to completely end my life. Idk why I‚Äôm scared, or hesitant. I might just end up walking to a hardware store and buying some sturdy rope and doing it the hard way. It‚Äôd only be like a 40 min trip. Didn‚Äôt really wanna go out by suffocation but my standards are low at this point, I‚Äôll take anything I can get. Anything else would be against the law and I can‚Äôt really risk that. I doubt anyone will see this...but I‚Äôm just at wits end. There is not one day, that I don‚Äôt go a few hours without fantasizing about the end. A full fledged fantasy, that no help will stop. What do I do, I‚Äôm so tired"
135,"Everytime my mind tells me soemthing is dangerous! I reply - ""whats the worse than can happen, death well i wouldn't mind it... it will be better""!

I dont think i can call myself suicidql with this but gosh i so wish something that kills me happens quick easy and without me knowing!  Like i blink and i am gone! No thoughts no ideas no pain!"
136,I've been thinking about it for a while and I think today would be a fitting day for me to meet my end. I just want to erase myself from the world. I don't deserve to live.
137,"My own mother says this. **Constantly**. I imagine just about every single person in my life tells me this.

I am a perpetual strain on her and those around me. Fortunately, that has never been many people, so the misery I cause is fairly limited (I suspect because people can sense just what a vile thing I am from a mile out). But it is there, and it seems only right to put an end to that.

If I cannot even form an understanding with others, then what difference does it make if I'm alive or dead? And since this causes me so much frustration and grief, why indeed wouldn't I just end it?

It is not possible to love what you do not understand."
138,"And my mom said no because she doesn‚Äôt want to pay the fees since we live in an apartment. This is the same person who told me to stop bothering her and just kill myself by jumping in front of a car. In addition to the other physical, emotional abuse she‚Äôs done to me. She pretends as if she‚Äôs never done anything to me and says that I‚Äôm a parasite for leeching off of her. Honestly, if I weren‚Äôt such a pussy, I would have killed myself already."
139,"I‚Äôm still strapped in to the roller coaster car. I fell the many ups. But I still the many downs. Even when I‚Äôm on a flat. I don‚Äôt fell the ups. I don‚Äôt fell the sow steady build of expectations and achievement. I don‚Äôt feel the anxiety resolution of reaching the tip tippy top! I don‚Äôt fee the awwww and calm of success and Triumph. No. I feel the chock of my gut in my throat from rush of being left behind, passed over, and forgotten. I feel the gravity of all those, just one times I messed up. I fell the pain of as I strain to keep my grip. I hear the whooshing from all the inner voices telling me what I need/should/could/can‚Äôt/won‚Äôt/can/will do and just plain out unable. I see the dark of the tunnel walls traps g me inside with a light at the end. But I‚Äôm and becoming ever more convinced the light at the end is just to far. I want off the coaster car for I‚Äôm semi-certain this car is off the track and in a feel fall. I can pull the latch beneath my finger tips. All it would take is a slow steady pull till the click."
140,"Endless pain, lonely nights, parents don‚Äôt even let me drink so I just have to sit here and feel it all."
141,"Hey.

so I have made a post in the subreddit about My first ex and how I am trying to cope,

my ex is currently still at home. He would have been shipped out to D.C. but since the rodeo is crazy, he is coding from his home here where he grew up.

so I am about 6 months out after he broke up from me. I‚Äôm not the best, but better then January we have been keeping in Touch in very light ways, not too much detail. He wanted to make sure he didn‚Äôt kill me I think. And he would let me throw a tantrum in these texts about how I hate my life, my 2700 debt, my lack of education, how I feel like I‚Äôm in so little control. being an Aspie.

, i have a blow up and settle down to a still unhappy Simmer. this was March- June.

today out of the blue, he texts me around noon to take me to ice cream. With his buddy. And I feel like im getting back to normal, I felt his eyes were still very pretty, but I focused on being a friend and it goes well.

i am about to sleep, but then I text him a thank you about the ice cream, and that‚Äôs when the I.v. Of casual pain started.

I was causally showed his new boyfriend. He looks like a better, sexier, beefier me. My eye color, my chest hair, my beefy build. He is disabled like me, has a troubled past like me, is insecure like me.

And then goes on to explain how they met a month ago, how they already signed a lease for a 3,000 dollar a month apartment. And I‚Äôm taking his in and acting like I care, just not in the painful amount it does.

It‚Äôs been a very short time in my perspective. And I‚Äôm already replaceable. I‚Äôm just as replacable as the A.i . Man fiend he makes for his work.

And I‚Äôm telling him it hurts a little to hear this stuff, but inside, I‚Äôm taken back to when he first dumped me months ago I wanted to hand myself with the extension cord, but the only thing that I got was that I could nit stand up I was that upset.

Hearing about how he would do things sexually to him and how much I really wanted him to do those things to me. When we dated.( his eyes were pretty, but if I‚Äôm being pervy, he has the cutest brown-orangish Mexican bubble butt). 

Ans I acted like I was proud of him, I am. I really am. Just it feels like that guy is a stand in for me.

I‚Äôm ashamed to say I still care for him. Aspie habits die hard.

I wanted to die a couple hours ago...

But my estranged mom picked up the phone when I called, and I cried like a bitch to my mom for the first time in 10years.

‚ÄúI miss him.‚Äù I would say.

‚Äú you miss him keeping you a dirty secret?‚Äù She would reply, and I would feel better I‚Äôve rate course of an hour.

And I am here in bed, on this July 4th morning, I want to keep it together today, please. And keep looking up."
142,"the only thing keeping me alive right now is my significant other playing pokemon mystery dungeon. i love them so much and im glad theyre showing me what theyre fixated about and it make sme so warm and fuzzy inside but. i jsut

cant stop thinking about how i want to die. ive tried attempting suicide what like almost ten times these past two years? i always pussy out. im so stupid and selfish"
143,"Check the other post on this account. I won't kill myself cuz it has no sense. But its not like I want to live. Its, cant describe it but ik other people are the same and much worse. I can't even find myself into pure pleasure cuz I been to hardcore phase           ( not gonna explain it to same motives i didn't go into that in the other post). I can't find nothing good for a long period of time and cant get my brain fried cuz ik how low is the low between highs . I can't , i don't whatever. Ik some neurochemestry &psychiatry ...don't help . Fk it . I could had it all, I rejected so much and now im done"
144,Its so fucking hard to find 100% painless way to die
145,"My mom (my grandma who i started living with when i was like 5 died in 2016). My dad just died. Overdosed. I pushed him away from my life. I'm 14, and all of this shit happening in so little time is really just.. horrible. Idk what to do. Feelign horrible. I'm having thoughts of the scenario of when his death occured. They wont leave me. It's gruesome. Horrifying. Him dead, the shot of his dead body, what it looks like in full detail. How to get rid of it, i'm just in total awe... Why him, what will happen for my grandpa whos in poor health and already went through the death of his wife... He is most likely developing dementia at this point of his life. Idk what to do man."
146,Having bad thoughts and I just want an easy way out but I know I could never do it. I just don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm supposed to live my life when I can barely get out of bed. I feel like I have a terminal illness with no cure I take anti depressants and they don‚Äôt do shit. I just want to feel fucking normal for once. I don‚Äôt even know why the fuck I‚Äôm making a reddit post I should just go to sleep so I don‚Äôt have to think anymore.
147,"part of me really doesn‚Äôt want any treatment for it, i just graduated highschool this year but with the virus and my new diagnosis i honestly just want to die. i don‚Äôt know how severe it is yet but all i know is if it‚Äôs bad, i‚Äôd rather just pass away from it"

Tomorrow I'm going somewhere that has a cliff. I know I shouldn't, but I want to so bad. The world's spiraling into oblivion, why can't I?"
151,"like im always making jokes with my friends and all, but if i told them ""i want to kill my self"", ""i have suicidal thoughts every day"", things would never be like they were before, they would always remember what i told them even if i act ""normally"" like the days before."
152,"Im shaking. I regret it so much.
please"
153,How much soap will kill me?
154,"Every time something changes dramatically in my life I also think the option to go is still there. It's strangely comforting knowing if it all goes to shit and you can't change things killing yourself is still there. I intentionally don't own much or allow myself to get too invested in things so if or when I finally decide there won't be as much for other people to clean up. No kids, no house, not married, and I don't own a car. I attempted a year long relationship that just ended on a vacation. This was my last attempt at the possibility that I could invest in something and the killing myself fall back would fade away. Unfortunately, the truth is it will always be there and I'll never make the progress that people expect of me."
155," I have been ignored all my life i've been used all my life pushed over outcasted sterotyped stigmedzied ghosted belittled been though loads of drugs medications diagnosis wards runarounds told lies for hope forced to stay alive forced to like others and forced to be happy and fake. get on medication therapy wards whatever and still not happy need to fake being happy to get out. it's rdidclous the things i've seen and endured and all I want to know is why? why so presistent to force your view and deeds onto me. BE HAPPY or be locked in a ward forever until you are. So here, let me put up my good acting skills for ya and I'm happy, now alls good. Fake happiness for the people like me to get around this life and not live it out imprisoned in those wards otherwise."

Edit- I‚Äôm going to try not to do it tomorrow"
157,"I don't enjoy anything. I just pretend to enjoy things. Everyday is just a drag. What's it all for? And I dislike where the world is going with COVID. I have one online friend who I met in real life last year. We used to be in a relationship. Lately I don't really even feel like talking to him. I'm tired of everyone and everything. I kinda have been for years. I think it's just really catching up to me now. Talking to my friend just feels like a drag and a chore now. The affection we had in our real life meeting was really lovely. But I don't know if I even care about that anymore. Life just sucks and doesn't do anything for me. What am I doing here even? 

I'm so tired of pretending. I'm not anti social but I can't relate to anyone and I can't really get along with anyone. I can't be my true self with anyone. I just have to be fake and pretend. 

I want a rest. I really want a rest. I guess there's something wrong with me if nothing gives me joy. Everyone else has things that they enjoy, don't they?

I'm existing and suffering."
158,"I can‚Äôt really even remember when I last felt happy. I watched my boyfriend commit suicide & I was left to pick up the pieces. I ask myself why everyday. Five years have passed & it replays in my head so much. I was literally picking up pieces to ‚Äòfix‚Äô him. This has made me an anxious piece of crap. I have since married and had a child. Those five years flew by yet I still feel empty. I feel like I can‚Äôt be fixed. I can tell my husband is unhappy with me. He use to constantly show me off, post me to social media. Now it‚Äôs like I don‚Äôt exist. Other shit is going on with us & it‚Äôs just killing me more and more. I don‚Äôt think he loves me anymore. I can‚Äôt take another heartbreak. I really do love him with everything in me. But I think he doesn‚Äôt want to be with me anymore. He just does more and more and more to push me away. I wish I could go to sleep and not wake up. My son is the only reason I haven‚Äôt killed myself."
159,"I‚Äôm tired of waking up everyday living the same life. Tired of sleeping for two hours just to wake up with sadness, tired of smiling in public and crying when I‚Äôm alone. I‚Äôm tired of advising others and trying my best to make them happy while no one does the same for me. I can‚Äôt do this anymore, I can‚Äôt go on feeling guilt, sadness, worthlessness and hopelessness. I honestly don‚Äôt see a future for myself. I‚Äôm a 17 year old African girl and I have a loving family, but sometimes they‚Äôre the last people I want to see. I always put others before myself because I hate seeing anyone suffer because I know what it feels like. When I was younger, I was molested by some men and bullied by some of my classmates in middle school. I was also teased and called weird a million times by some classmates in high school. I thought this one boy was different and that he actually cared about me but he was just a player. Him and his friends placed a bet on me and used me, he was the first guy I ever really liked but he was no different than the rest. I‚Äôve been suicidal since I was a child and I‚Äôve always been too scared to act on it, due to the fact that I was raised in a Christian home and know where I‚Äôd end up. Also, my parents used to argue a lot, my oldest brother went through something devastating for a long time, which affected the whole family, but he eventually went off on my birthday this year. That happening on my birthday made me feel even more guilty because I was aware of what he was doing but I kept it from my parents because I was afraid that he would would get physical with me, having had a traumatic past with men, mind you, my parents live in another country. I have a lot of problems which have affected me in general, although I act like everything is okay. Having African parents, I‚Äôm afraid to tell them anything about how I feel, because they‚Äôll start asking questions I don‚Äôt want to answer. I‚Äôd rather speak to someone who doesn‚Äôt know anything about me and can‚Äôt judge me. I always isolate myself especially during this quarantine, I never leave my room, only when it‚Äôs necessary. My whole life is complicated, I moved from my home country to live with my two brothers in Canada. My grades weren‚Äôt perfect in my old school but they‚Äôre a lot better here cause the courses aren‚Äôt as hard as back home. So me having good grades makes my parents think I‚Äôm okay but I‚Äôm not. I‚Äôm really sorry if this is long but I just had to get some of it off my chest. There‚Äôs still a lot I haven‚Äôt typed but I‚Äôll stop here. I‚Äôm just tired of this pain, guilt and sorrow. I don‚Äôt have anyone I can talk to and I fear I‚Äôll do something to myself that can‚Äôt be undone. I don‚Äôt want to hurt my family and anyone who may care about me but I need to put myself first for once and end this misery. I always see happy people or even couples and it makes me wonder, ‚ÄúAm I ever going to have this?‚Äù. I don‚Äôt deserve anything good in this world and I just want to be out to rest."
160,"I have distanced myself from friends. Broke up with my girlfriend. Lost my job. Saved money for my mother. It's beginning to look like a bleak future for me, friends. I don't have much family left so I hope that if I somehow don't make it- then maybe I don't leave a bad record. I wasn't the greatest of people but- I did try my best and made sure that my friends and family got taken care of. I just hope that everyone remembers to love and be kind to one another."
161,"The only thing I‚Äôm good at is sleeping and I can‚Äôt even do that anymore, it‚Äôs 3am and I‚Äôm wide awake just wanting to die, if that‚Äôs not a fat mood idk what is. I plan on ending things next week for good this time - life has no meaning anymore and this feeling of emptiness inside me is too much to bare. Rn the only thing keeping me going is knowing how upset my best friend and mum would be but even that‚Äôs fading now and I‚Äôve written my suicide note. Everything‚Äôs fallen apart - my relationships, friendships, I‚Äôm not me anymore and I feel drained like I‚Äôve been so busy trying to fix other people, there‚Äôs nothing left of me and I can‚Äôt get it back. The prospect of uni doesn‚Äôt even excite me anymore, I really want my time on this earth to end so I don‚Äôt have to keep waking up every morning to the same feeling of worthlessness that haunts me but I‚Äôm scared it‚Äôs going to hurt and I won‚Äôt just slip away peacefully like I intend. 
Everyone keeps telling me things will get better but I truly don‚Äôt believe they will and my mindset doesn‚Äôt have the will power to change. I honestly feel drained like I‚Äôm a shell of a person whose just existing because of biological functions like eating and breathing but I‚Äôm not living and I don‚Äôt want to live if I‚Äôm honest. The world is so incredibly full of evil and suffering with people being the most cruel of all, I don‚Äôt want to go on like this. Thankyou for giving me somewhere to vent."
162,I‚Äôd rather kill myself than work a shitty job to live this shitty life. Nothing external could make my life better my brain is too fucked. I don‚Äôt really care about anything. One of the few things I care about is girls and shit. Like two girls like me but I don‚Äôt fucking know why. I hate everything.
163,I got a job as a full-time drive though teller last week. I had to quit today because it was too high pressure with all my mental health issues. My parents are upset with me and keep telling me to grow up. I'm not built for this world. The best way for me to feel better is if I'm dead.
164,"I'm miserable, every day I wake up with no excitement or joy just kind of dead. I feel like I have no emotion no happiness only a lurking sense of anxiety. My mind is static, I don't even really think about anything. I haven't looked forward to anything in years. I haven't had a job since February, I'm out of money. Honestly thinking I'd rather be homeless or kill myself than find another dead end job that drains me and pays me nothing. I just so over it. If it wasn't for my pets I'd have killed myself or disappeared myself onto the streets by now. I know my partner can care for my cat and my parents can care for my dog, but they're the only thing I love and care about and I worry that they'll miss me. They probably won't  tho, they're just pets."
165,"I'm not suicidal but I don't see any point to life anymore, we're all going to die so what's the point in fucking trying. No matter if you're the richest person or the happiest, either way you're going to die so who cares. Why would I put my self through torture and suffering for 60 years just for it all to go to waste and die. It's useless, there's no point in fucking living."
166,"Or maybe it's more sadness never ends.  I can't expect to feel happy all the time, but I'm tired of feeling like shit every day.  I've worked hard to make changes in my life that I thought would make me feel better, but I only feel more empty now.  My best friend fucking hates me, idek why I'm posting this anymore.  I've felt done with life before but each time it gets harder and harder.  I have less to live for the last time I was this suicidal.  It fucking sucks, I want these thoughts to leave."
167,
168,"Been on and off the suicide idea for fucking almost a decade at this point and I've sorta rationalized this deathwish is gonna be a forever issue. I've found a way to help is not to just try to do positive things or things you enjoy but to do positive things that you enjoy. Gotta put em together. I've been painting 40k minifigures and going on regular bike rides though the forest near my place. Im in a better mood lately and have actual motivation for work. The thoughts going away i know damn well won't happen. My medication has even been messing the thoughts up even more, giving me motivation to do risky things and generally making me give less fucks than normal. Also being social impacts it a lot too. I have no friends except work friends and they can be incredibly grating to talk to. There are days i don't even speak a single damn word when not at work. So yeah, telling people to do things that'll help like a hobby isn't entirely ignorant if you're willing to ACTUALLY MAKE THE FUCKING EFFORT TO CHANGE. YES I KNOW IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO HAVE MOTIVATION TO DO ANYTHING BUT HEAVENS TO BETSY IT WORKS WONDERS WHEN YOU FIND SOMETHING YOU ENJOY."
169,You know the drill just another depressed child killing himself I know it doesnt matter but I felt like someone should know that I'm going to die thank you for the laughs and the crys reddit
170,"My step mother has just told me she wanted to kill herself. And I don't know what to do.
Recently, I could tell some things were wrong in the relationship between my father and her.
There were as an argument that shook the house late at night, my step mother began to sleep downstairs on the sofa.

I knew something was wrong. I thought this would all work out eventually. As this isn't the first time a problem has occurred between them. But no this was bad. Lately I could tell she was upset throughout the days I was with her.
But at my own stupid fault I ignored it, thinking it would just blow over.

My father is constantly at work, and she is mostly left alone with her two young children. On the days me and my brother come, we just stay upstairs or stick to the PlayStation. We don't really spend any time with her, as we are just teenagers wanting to be left alone. 

But yesterday, she started to tell me things how she wished I would grow up and get a house so she could live with me as she hated it here. I kinda brushed it off. But later on in the day when I had just finished eating, she came in and had got some food for herself. As I was about to leave she told me to sit down with her, so I did. 

We started talking, and I asked what had happened between my dad and her. She began to talk about how people were selfish and eventually said that she sometimes thought she should just kill herself. I rushed to her holding tell her not to think such thoughts and how everything is going to be OK. 
 
I held her hand and told her not to worry, how everything was going to work out. I asked what really happened. She began ot tell me how she put trust in another family of ours. Talking to this person all the time but the person was recording their conversations. I don't know what she said, but I know when my dad found out he wasn't happy. And that's what probably struck the argument earlier. 

My dad even took her phone off her, and now all she does these days is sit at home with nothing to do. 
She then told me how she wanted to learn how to drive but my dad wouldn't let her. I don't know if any abuse has happened but I wouldn't be surprised. 

As my father did use to beat up my actual mother. 
I love my step mother, as she was a mother for me when my own mother couldn't be one. I stook with her throughout the rest of our conversation and we even did some puzzles together. I even checked up on her before I went to sleep.

And now I'm scared of what to do and how to help her, I'm definitely going to try and stick with her tomorrow. But I soon will have to go to my actual mothers house for a couple of days. And then she will be left alone again. I don't know what to do form here. I wanna help her and I don't want to lose her. 
Could someone please advise me on how to help her."

172,"I feel like ive totally wasted my life and will continue to do so. I am ashamed of how little ive accomplished and how i havent contributed anything to the world. why do i feel so much guilt for existing? is this how its supposed to be? how do i feel like im a person worth keeping alive

i hope this belongs here. its not urgent but i do think about it"
173,"People tell you that you are a good friend, and a good listener. They like you because you can give advice and they think that you are happy and a great person.

When you feel bad and need someone to talk to, you talk to that person that told you that you can count with, no matter what. 

You speak to them, telling them that you are actually depressed and feel bad. Some of them will tell you that they feel worse and start talking about themselves, and others will feel that you‚Äôre just pretending to be sad and playing with the word ‚Äúdepression‚Äù or ‚Äúanxiety‚Äù as everyone does. 

Some of them, and I don‚Äôt if they are the worst or best ones, get away from you. They notice that you aren‚Äôt the one that they were seeking for in their lives, and some of them want to protect themselves, or they are just not interest on having a depressed fucking friend because it is BORING and sad to give advice and love to one of them. 

YOU LOVE and trust in someone again, and feel like they like you too and they care about you, you think they are your friends but when you need help they don‚Äôt like you anymore and you don‚Äôt have that person in your life that made you think that you are a little bit more important in the world.

I‚Äôm not asking for help out of here anymore, I can‚Äôt handle it again."
174,We don't have guns in our house so shooting myself is out of the question I could always pull an anime and jump off a roof but schools out and my house isn't tall enough to kill myself I'd break a few bones but eh and I suppose I could stab myself but that could take awhile and it would be hard to stab yourself anywhere vital I don't have rope to hang myself so that's out the question to so any creative ways so I can kill myself and everyone can be done with my crap and I'll be free of the worlds bullshit
175,"but i cant do it myself, i hope i just die"
176,my mini journals on reddit help while I'm in tears
177,Why am I always just sad? I haven't had a day where I haven't felt like I should just disappear. I just watch videos about suicide online and how easy it is. I've even thought about what I'd write on my note that I'd leave behind. I have a friend who knows about what I feel like but after I told him I still felt empty. I've tried telling my parents but I chickened out after crying a bit. By the way this is my first post on Reddit and might be my last depending on how I feel after posting this. I'm sorry to be a burden to you guys.
178,"I'm genuinely not interested in this world. Most of the people who I have met disgust me for some reason or another, even my family. I want to die simply because this life doesn't interest me. I think something like a civil war would give me something to do so I don't want to die. I feel bad though because I think its a selfish idea. Thoughts?"
179,"Would it be wrong to kill myself if I never had nothing going on for my life?. 

Would it be wrong to *kms* because I'm a **loser** in life. 

My parents never gave a shit about me. 
Besides giving the stuff that I need to survive as if I were their pet. 

*(being emotionally neglected as a child is just great*

If reincarnation existed would u like to die? 

Just so u can re-live another day where you can get the chance to get a normal life

I was home-schooled half of 
7th, 8th, & 9th grade because of the lack of social skills that I had, social anxiety and later on depression
This lasted around 7th - 10th grade. 

Taking this online school made me graduate high-school early at the age of 15.
 (I kind of cheated through it though)
But I still got an easy Diploma

I'd say for two years of my life I did nothing. 

From the ages of 15 through 16

Until I reached the age of 17.
I did do one year of college for hospitality management 

Likewise. Things did not get better for me since then

I am still both socially awkward, isolated and depressed.
I am bored of life. helpless.‚ù§ I have no friends, in which whom I can't relate to. 

I live for what I like and love to eat. I barely have any hobbies besides cooking, singing, and drawing a little and watching YouTube. 

My parents are very little when it comes to acknowledging my future. 

Would it be wrong to kill myself even tho I got nothing going on for life? I am used to being depressed, Even though I am a stronger person for who I was before


Big point here. I won't kill myself because of that.

 I'll just wait"
180,"like why do we have to keep living this shit everyday, i think god should do an update and add a ""quit"" button, like wtf im not even important to anybody it wouldnt matter to anyone if i quit. fuck and being a pussy like me is fucking bad like, i cant even kill myself bc im afraid of pain. smh"
181,"Hey guys. So I was trying to make friends and someone told me to hang myself which got a lot of upvotes. I'm going to do it tonight so can I please get some advice on how to tie the knot. There is no reason for living anymore and I know people will probably post hateful comments here too. I am relatively attractive but for reddit need to kill myself because the incels hate me. About 40 of them have sent me messages now and I agree. I am evil incarnate. Please help me leave this world, please egg me on because I deserve to die. I have a knife which I will use to slit my throat and bleed out if I can't hang myself. I give up. Please send me motivation for killing myself, feel free to tell me I am an ugly slut, it will make me do it.

182,"I am done and want to end it. Of course I have a lot of debt from a credit card and with parents. Goal is to make sure family is safe from retaliation from law enforcement and debt collectors. 

Living in California

I would like to liquidate my assets (car and cheap/old apartment furnishings) to give to parents tax free to off set damages. Cash, bond, ira savings, trust fund? Best way to maximize approximately $15,000 for family?

How can I protect family against retaliation from credit card company? I am the only signer on one credit card and a cosigner with mother to one with a different credit card company and bank. 

Can Law Enforcement retaliate against family or investigate/tax/seize liquidated assets?

I am a cosigner for an apartment with my father until middle of next year, what's the best way to shield family from leasing agency retaliation?

It's safe to assume that committing suicide on private property is a huge headache for business owners. However the most effective way I can see to guarantee death would be to rent a gun from range and leave the body in an easily sanitized area.  Goal is to go quietly and efficiently with as little concern from others as possible and as cheaply as possible. Would a gun range have liability immunity in this case?

Finally I want to guarantee the body be recycled/donated and no memorial/funeral service is conducted. Do I need a lawyer to be executor of this or can I simply get a notary or cheaper/simpler alternative? 


Thank you for your advice/help with these questions."
183,"I have spent years and years and years holding on to hope, and whatever I hold on to as hope whether it be a new lifestyle or love or habits or whatever, somehow always that hope is soured, and ends up hurting me instead. I am just....I am so tired of this. I am exhausted, I feel burned out. I put so much effort into improving my life and the lives of people around me, I put effort into relationships and love, and all that effort throughout time never has amounted to anything but me feeling alone, exhausted, and miserable. I've had a bad feeling this was my final year for a long while here and the way my life is going it just feels inevitable now. Death is my only escape from the endless dead ends in my life, from the constant struggles to improve my life and/or find some semblance of happiness or contentment. It all has gone nowhere and I just feel like no matter how the deck is shuffled, suicide is the inevitable end game here. I'm tired. I'm tired of exerting so much energy to feel better or make a better life or find love or do anything to feel happy and it resulting in disappointment and pain. I think I'm gonna buy a gun, and give my best friend one last chance to see me in person and tie up a few loose ends, leave some gifts behind, and just end this suffering. I really just feel like I extinguished everything and this is the only way out. I dont even want to try anymore. I have exerted so much energy trying to have a content life just to always be in pain."
184,"I‚Äôm suicidal but I‚Äôm not saying I‚Äôm gonna actually kill myself yet. I just wanna know if jumping off a 10 meter (32 feet) bridge would kill me? If I jump head first so my head hits the ground. The ground is dirt.

I don‚Äôt wanna jump and end up alive in pain, or end up paralyzed or some shit like that. If I attempt I wanna be sure I die. There‚Äôs also coyotes in the area, I‚Äôve ran into some before. So if I end up alive after jumping what happens if a swarm of coyotes finds me.. doesn‚Äôt sound too fun."
185,"I either live until I die naturally or I kill myself. Neither makes any difference to me or the universe.

Living is hard. Circumstances don't matter, I just hate living. I used to think I felt bad because of external reasons but I've come to understand that I just hate existence itself.

Suicide is freedom. 

Suicide is easy.

Suicide is selfish.

It would destroy my father and my sister. I love them. I don't want to hurt them. 

But that in and of itself does not allow me to keep living. 

It's equally selfish to make them my reason to live. That implies that whenever I get hurt me it's their fault for forcing me to be alive. Eventually I'll come to hate them for forcing me to endure the pain of being alive. Sometimes I already do.

I can't die because of them, but I also can't live a life I hate just because of them. 

To go on living I need to make peace with myself and find my own motivation. Nobody else can do that for me, and I don't know how to do it myself. My only other options are suicide or killing myself with anti depressants. The part of me that hates being alive is me. Without it I'll just be an empty shell of a human."
186,"Ive been trying to date this girl. I spent like 4 months texting and calling her daily. One day while being in a call with 2 other friends 1 of them asked if we were something or if she liked me. She said absolutely no and that i was ugly. I left the call and cries in my bed for a while as im very sensitive to this kind of things. She proceedes to call me like 5 times and message me that she didnt mean it. I tell her im just searching someone not for a relationship but to talk and just vibe and have a great time. I dont want even kissing. Im not yet ready as im still young. She says yes and starts being a lot more affective. I started talking less to her because i thought that she would text me as i had done everyday for 4+ months. She stops texting me like for 2 weeks and we started talking again but much less. I dont know if i interperted it wrong but im nothing more than a friend to her. Ive tried with several girls and i always get rejected but with her is the best ive ever gotten. Should i continue and try to gain her or just give up and keep thinking of ending it all.(havnt mentioned but i have severe depression, mental issues and have tried ending it all). With her i felt that somebody cared about me and giving a chance to my life. Idk, ill leave it to you guys as i dont really feel like doing anything with my life anymore."

191,"I just always feel unhappy and when something does make me happy it just never works out. I like this girl and I'm a girl. I think she likes me but I doubt it. I feel like I'm just gonna break if i get rejected tomorrow. I'm not gonna confess just ask if she could take me home after work. I just wanna talk to her and get to know her. I feel calm and at ease with her. But I'm scared because I know she won't understand me. I've been through a lot. I'm always back and forth with depression. I don't have anyone that understands it. I just put it in the back of my head and ignore it. I just don't feel like I'm gonna ever meet someone who truely understands me and loves me especially because i can only fall in love with females. I was in a relationship with a guy for 3 years and he just used me. Manipulated me did everything he could to keep me chained down. But at that time i thought i should settle down and just accept it. i'm not with him anymore cus I just wanted to find happiness if it exist but with who I am I honestly don't believe I'll find it. I've been depressed all through my childhood for as long as i can remember. I just feel like i can't stand it any longer just want it to finally end. My body issues drive me crazy physical and mentally. I just wanna find a loving girl thats real. But it's always about sex. No matter who I'm with even if they understand me 100% its just about sex and satisfaction for them. I'm just so sick of it. I feel like I'm completely alone I feel like I just always watch happiness of others from the sidelines while I stand here alone and unhappiness for most likely the rest of my life because thats all I've ever felt is pain and suffering. Am I really suppose to just take it and suffer endlessly like my mom did? She gave everything to her religion it never did anything for her. No matter what I feel I'm bound to a life of suffering even when I go through life being positive people just throw it back at you and hate you even through its just fake happiness.... fake smiles fake hope.... This is why i held on to my first love for 10 years... she gave me something to fight for, a purpose even if it was unrequited even if it hurt. it was still better than feeling so empty.... just having nothing. I can have everything in my life cars money job etc and not feel happy I don't care about that stuff I never have. The only thing in my life that has ever made me happy was the feeling of love...wanting to protect someone with everything you have. I love that feeling but it never lasts.... I'm just lost, and truely suffering....."
192,Idl what to really do. I see a therapist but he tells me he can't really help me where my foster mom won't let me change to someone who might help. I've had 4 and they don't r really help much anyway. I was in a smaller town than a lot of people don't even understand how bad things are how much I've been through they just pretend to.I have insomnia and I shake a lot and had to take pills cuz my mom fed me drugs when I was a kid. I try to play sports but idk if I can keep doing it been doing for years but now I'm recovering from being underweight and I get bad tics. I really wish I had a mom or dad. My foster mom just gets drunk and yells at my brother. All of my brothers are mean even my younger brother has special needs but he knows how to follow the rules when he is being bribed and destroys stuff when he isn't. Summer school sucks right now and school might be starting there after the summer I don't know how I'm going to do it. I'm really funny in class and I act super cool a lot of girls want to be with me and stuff and then I come home and I don't do anything I just stay up all night and play games and do stupid stuff I have hurt myself a couple time are mostly wish that I could just not wake up or get taken out. I'm scared if losing all my friends even if most of them are fake because of sports or whatever. My mom b fed me drugs as a kid and she basically treated me like a baby until I was maybe ten my actual life started a few years ago and we got taken off but nothing I actually began it's just getting dragged on. Actually wish I could go back to my mom and eventually died from overdose

I don‚Äôt want to just talk about killing myself all the time bc that would just annoy them. But I do want them to know when I‚Äôm gone. That would require me telling them and then quickly proceeding to complete the task. 

Then there‚Äôs the problem of my like-a-son, an ex‚Äôs kid who I‚Äôm still close with. I love him but I‚Äôm afraid my depression has already been transferred to the poor kid. I believe I am truly burdensome. I would want to notify his mom and let her decide how to share the news, if at all.

The worst is, I just found out someone totally ignored me. Someone who pretended to be nice and caring just totally ignored me. When I found this I instantly burst into tears. It hurts much much more than this severe cramp. I am human being with emotions. When someone do this to me, it fucking hurts. I am done. I am fucking done. I am done people ignoring me, hurting me even if I try to be nice and caring even if I am also the one who needs support. It's not like anybody cares. I am totally hurt and exhausted.

I've heard the horror stories of people who've been sent to a mental hospital, and I absolutely dread that happening to me. Not to mention the medical bill that comes along with it, which I definitely wouldn't be able to pay. 

I'm gonna guess that telling them that I have a well thought out plan for my suicide probably won't go down well, but how much would I be able to tell them? Am I allowed to admit that I have intense suicide ideation, or do I have to dumb it down and pretend it's just occasional?

206,"My frustration, anxiety and depression are at an all time high. I feel like everyone hates me and I‚Äôm terrified everyday going into work. I‚Äôve been suicidal for weeks. 

I cried to my therapist about it 2 weeks ago and she didn‚Äôt have a solution for me. She started to tell me she thinks I use things, like my attitude and my weight (I‚Äôm about 75 pounds overweight), to push people away. I got upset because I was just trying to talk about how scared I was to go into work later that day. It felt unrelated and frankly, mean. By upset I mean I started crying harder and then I stood up and said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt feel like talking about this anymore‚Äù and walked out. 

I texted her today to see if she would be willing to write me out of work since I am still struggling significantly and we had talked previously about me taking a leave. She said no since I walked out that day and is refusing to take me back as a patient. She told me I need to find someone else to see. 

This makes me feel even more abandoned and dejected - I feel like no one gives a shit about me or how I‚Äôm doing. Even my therapist who I‚Äôve paid hundreds of dollars to and have been seeing for months doesn‚Äôt give a shit. She knows exactly how that would make me feel and doesn‚Äôt care. I‚Äôm heartbroken and feel like she‚Äôs leaving me with no solutions. Even if I found a new therapist it would take weeks to establish rapport enough that they would be willing to write me out of work. She knows I‚Äôm in crisis and that‚Äôs not a viable solution and she just doesn‚Äôt give a shit because I‚Äôm nothing but an inconvenience to her. Do these people ever actually care about the impact on their patients? 

It makes me feel like my only recourse here is suicide. I can‚Äôt continue to live this way. So what other option do I have but to kill myself?"
207," Title says it all, people are fucking delusional."
208,"I‚Äôve been suicidal for 4 years. I believed those who said it would get easier. Looking back, they‚Äôve never experienced such a level of self hatred and such immense despair...so how would they even know if it were to get better?

I‚Äôve been fed false hope for years. The selfishness of those around me. To keep me here. So they felt better about themselves. And wouldn‚Äôt have to feel for 5 minutes what I‚Äôve been feeling for 10 years. . I‚Äôve been told that suicide is selfish. But who‚Äôs  really being selfish. Why are you fighting so hard to keep me alive in misery, rather then let me be dead in peace. 

I‚Äôm tired. I want to spread love and I want to spread my light. I have a lot of it. But I‚Äôm drained. Mentally, physically, spiritually, emotionally. 

I have no fight left in me. 

It doesn‚Äôt get better."
209,
210,"I don't know why I keep having these thoughts. But the way people have hurt me make me wonder... if I died, would they finally care about me? Would they finally throw themselves on their bed and bawl for hours?

I'm sick of thinking about them. I want their memories erased from my head. But until then, it makes me want to die. I wish I could escape this world. I think of the fun times I had with my friends... until they just suddenly left me. And they didn't speak to me at all. It was dizzying. If I were to die, perhaps they would finally feel the same pain...

At the same time, I realize how fucked up I sound. I'm sick of these thoughts. They keep coming up, no matter how much I tell my head to stop spiraling into that sort of thinking process.

Even if they aren't empathetic it's a win-win. I would be dead, and they would finally be rid of me."
211,"I don‚Äôt know how to deal with my life anymore, I‚Äôm doing bad at medical school and I think I‚Äôll have to redo this year. My mental health decided to take a  trip to Aruba and is not coming back. I tried to talk about my depression to my parents, the first time when I was 16 they found me selfharming and I had to tell them, they hit me and told me they already had 2 dysfunctional children ( I have two disabled slibings) and I was being lazy (I always help with housechores, babysit and I was the top student in high school) and that I should move out. I tried to talk to my mother of this years later and she told me ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt just get a gun and kill yourself‚Äù. Now when they think I‚Äôm sad they tell me to just get over it.

I‚Äôm failing at everything am doing right now, I can‚Äôt concentrate because I just wanna cry. I‚Äôm not living for myself, the only thing that keeps me alive is knowing that without me my slibings won‚Äôt have nobody to take care of them when my parents pass away. 

I just want it to end, I‚Äôm tired and living feels pointless. I really regret my decisions in my life plan, I should have been honest with myself and no so immature."
212,"Today I looked at my sister‚Äôs baby for the first time and said, ‚ÄúIm gonna be around for a long time.‚Äù

Ive always thought Im gonna kill myself. And I always think, I wont last long. I just felt like it was destiny."
213,"I feel like I‚Äôm floating away from reality. I feel like I‚Äôm already dead.

I‚Äôm a great actor. I can smile and pretend that I‚Äôm happy but I feel nothing on the inside. I have nothing left to live for. It seems that everything I love gets taken away.

Why do I have to wait to kill myself? I deserve death after all I‚Äôve been through. Not as a punishment, but as a blessing. 

So stop trying to save me to fulfill your fucking hero complex. Stop being selfish. I‚Äôm not going to stay alive for you or for anyone anymore. All people do is hurt me. I‚Äôm just a fucking tool. 

I died a long time ago. My soul left my body, and I‚Äôm just walking husk. You cannot stop me from pulling the trigger. 

But of course none of you care. You wouldn‚Äôt even bat an eye at my death I bet. ‚ÄúWhat a shame‚Äù you‚Äôll wonder and you‚Äôll move on from you life. 

No one loves a ghost"
214,"Just let me go already.

Why can't you let me go.

Why can't I let myself go.

Why do I stay here and be tortured every second of my existence.

Why can't you let me go, me.

Just let me embrace it.

The nothingness.

I lust for it.

I feel like im going insane at your expense.

I'm fucking splitting myself in twain.

I cant even think without second thoughts or thinking about myself.

I just want to stop.

Just dissappear.

Let me die in peace.

Help me."
215,"My existence brings nothing to this world and only pain to me. I‚Äôve done nothing but hurt others and try to help me and then complain when i‚Äôm alone. i don‚Äôt mean to. i really don‚Äôt. but it still ends up happening. i can‚Äôt even fucking respond to text messages anymore. i can‚Äôt even do any of the things that used to bring me little blips of happiness anymore. i just sit and fucking rot. you‚Äôd think ‚Äúwell, if you can‚Äôt make yourself happy, why not sacrifice yourself for others and make something of yourself?‚Äù but i can‚Äôt even fucking do that. i was told to become a doctor. i can‚Äôt even do that. i can‚Äôt even force my useless, selfish ass to fucking study for long enough to be good enough. to give genuine effort. i have no friends, a few guys i sleep with/send to and that‚Äôs the end of that. i‚Äôm not even attracted to guys. i‚Äôm a fucking lesbian for christ‚Äôs sake. i‚Äôm so desperate for even a sparkle of positive attention i‚Äôll let anyone do anything.  i think a part of me is trying to get knocked up so i have an excuse to kill my self (as a method of abortion). another nail in the fucking coffin. my parents don‚Äôt care either. all that matters to them is that i remain presentable enough to not make others think they‚Äôre bad. and god forbid i do. i get it though. all i do is fucking eat. i‚Äôm a waste of resources, might as well give a return that way. and if i die, they can use me as an organ transplant or something. still beats me sticking around. not even old enough to legally drive and i‚Äôve already fucked myself and others up beyond repair. what really drives the point home is that there are so many people worse off than me, but i still have the audacity to be worthless."
216,"I just found out yesterday that my dad has covid-19 and the possibility of him recovering is slim because he's diabetic but he doesn't seem to be struggling so that's good. The only one's suffering is me, my mom and younger sister, it's been really hard and having no friends to talk to, just a girlfriend but I think this unfortunate situation is going to tear us apart. I've been planning my death since last year of July and then this shit happen, my family is poor and the road ahead seems like hell. I don't know how much I  can take. Fuck 2020"
217,"And it's absolutely wrong, I know, but it doesn't make it not true. I'm a mistake. Please someone end my suffering."
218,Surely instead of punishing me you should be helping me all ur doing is making it worse
219,"You know when you don't truly want to end things, but you don't want to feel or exist in this dumb game called life. I think I'm done with life, I just want to disappear into nothingness."
220,I can‚Äôt do anything. I‚Äôm useless. A literal burden upon those that are in my life. I wish to perish. I can‚Äôt cry and I hate it. I can‚Äôt do anything right. My existence is so pointless.

222,"The most amazing girl I've ever met walked into my life. When I met her she was 8 and a half months pregnant and had a black eye. She just got abandoned by her abusive ex at a hotel and came to a mutual friend's. 

She couldn't stay with him so I offered her a bed at my house. A place where she could be safe. (Ex boyfriend came by mutual friends and broke out his front windows). Me and her vibe, she is amazing with my kids, she walked in like she had been here there whole time. I can honestly say I love her. 

She went into labor and the way everything went down I literally delivered the baby without professional help in my bathroom. She had made the decision before hand to adopt the baby out, but her ex will not leave her alone. He will terrorize her as long as she's around. She got an offer to move out of state with her dad and now she's leaving... 

I hate that this is the best thing for her, and I know she has to leave to find any amount of peace in her life. 
I want to ask her to stay so bad. But I know i can't. 
I can't look at her right now and I know its hurting her to see me like this. I just don't know what to do anymore"

  Can someone help me please?"
226,"I talked about it with some friends, but I want more outlets, so here I am, here is what happened. This was around a few months ago, but I've been thinking about a lot recently.

I am diagnosed with, depression, psychosis, and aspergers.

While I was at the doctor's office, I was playing on a video game, while this girl came in with her mother, but this girl had autism, and she was around 30 years old,  she saw me playing my game and sat next to me watching me play it, not saying anything. She liked video games as well, her mom was talking to my own mom about her daughter, she said she never had friends and that she was often bullied at school. She just wanted a friend, she just wanted someone to have memories with, she just wanted something she never had before. And what did my stupid piece of useless shit do? I ignored her, I ignored her while she was watching me play my game, I ignored her when she told me bye in the saddest voice I ever heard. Her mom also said she was gonna get sent to foster care, because her mom couldn't take care of her anymore. I never seen her again after that, all these thoughts rushed through my head, what if she killed herself because I didn't wanna be her friend? What if she's being abused in a foster home? What if she's dead? All because of my idiotic stupidity, someone could potentially be dead because of me. 

And my mom told she doesn't know what happened to her, I just don't wanna live my entire life wondering if someone could potentially be dead because of me, and also living slowly being eaten by my own guilt.

I don't know if I can do it anymore, I don't know if I can do it anymore."
227,"I‚Äôm trans and dysphoria is so bad, I came out to my family and they ‚Äúaccept‚Äù me but refuse to call me by my real name and pronouns. My friend group agitates me because they‚Äôre so predictable. They never want to hangout with me anymore and I just don‚Äôt get it. I tried getting a therapist but it didn‚Äôt work. I would hang myself tonight if I had the rope. I could wait and come out to the high school but for what? Just to get bullied? I‚Äôll never be comfortable in my body unless I drop thousands of dollars I don‚Äôt have so what‚Äôs the point fighting a battle I‚Äôll never win?"
228,I want to kill my self because of stress of family and health and anxiety and just all of this bullshit that has been going on I've just thought about and said to myself why not hang yourself of shoot yourself in the head I just feel like a meaningless speck in the universe and if I was dead would it even matter
229,
230,stuffs when people say you can't do it I actually can
231,My break down at work was the worse one I have ever had I have bipolar depression and it hit me like a truck I had to avoid people and try everything not to cry like a bitch I even went to places where no one could see me to hit thing to keep my self angry so I wouldn‚Äôt just break down this was the closest I have been to wanting to die and idk what made it happen if I was at home that night I would not be here today I haven‚Äôt told anyone about this but I need to get it off my chest
232,"I usually use this sub as a source of venting, but never have I once actually thought I would commit suicide in the near future. I always imagined it would happen in my 20s, but as of lately I‚Äôm thinking it could happen in a few years. Everyday death is getting less and less scary to me. Death was my #1 fear for the longest time but now it doesn‚Äôt scare me that much. I‚Äôm afraid as my emotions continue to grow and the more sleep deprived I am I‚Äôll finally do it one day. And then I‚Äôll be happy. Nobody is giving me the one thing that could save me, and that one thing is love. I give love but I never receive. Just to feel someone close to me and have them love me would be enough reason to live but it won‚Äôt happen. Not once in a million years."
233,"It's actually not a complete list but like one thing that I hate more than just about anything. People who act like they can relate. Unless your entire life is consumed with wanting to die you can't relate. I'm new to this sub and honestly don't even know how I found it. I just kinda stumbled upon it. After a couple of days of reading posts I noticed a lot of people telling people, hang in there, it will get better, someone loves you, blah, blah, blah. 

I totally appreciate that there are people out there who actually do care but sometimes it doesn't get better and sometimes nobody out there loves you. There is not one single person on this planet that gives a fuck about me. Including my family. Telling me that there is is just a little bit insulting. So on behalf of those on here who really hate themselves please don't say you know how we feel unless you are having the same struggles. If you want to help just offer to be open and available to talk and more importantly listen without being judgmental. Sometimes it's just nice to be able to unload your burdens without being judged or having someone tell you what to do."
234,"I can't take it anymore. I know I try to cheer people up all the time; I feel like a hypocrite because I want to die almost every day. It's too much. I'm in a worse position than I was last year; I'm in physical and mental agony, I fucking wish I was aborted."
235,"I know my self esteem is bad but I didn‚Äôt know it was that bad. Realizing now that my self esteem leads to why I wish I was dead. I think my existence is the biggest burden that anyone could ever face. That I‚Äôm so ugly, just by looking at me, people wish they were dead too. Hearing my voice puts a stain on their day and ruins it. I‚Äôm scared to leave the house in case anyone sees me. I wish I could personally apologize to every person who‚Äôs met me or even laid eyes on me, but that would involve interacting with them, and I would never wish that experience on anybody. I believe that I will never be deserving of love, respect, honesty, or even anyone‚Äôs time because I‚Äôm me. My personality is horrible, my face looks horrible, my body is horrible. It makes me want to die. I feel like the world would be heaven on earth if I just wasn‚Äôt on it anymore. I wasn‚Äôt always like this. This blew up in the past 2 years. The only man I‚Äôve ever loved, and loved more than I thought anyone could ever experience, lied to me and cheated. I already had low self esteem before hand, but not this bad. She ended up being abusive towards him, and he still loved her more than he loved me. So much so that when she demanded that he completely cut off contact with me (despite us having a child together), he agreed. Every now and then he would secretly check in and I would update him on our child. But despite beating him he would still brag about her to me like it didn‚Äôt her, how she was ‚Äúthe pretty girl‚Äù wherever they went, how she was out of his league, how he fell in love with her so quickly. I will never be her. I will never be loved, or respected, or cared about. I don‚Äôt feel like there‚Äôs any reason for me to be on this earth anymore. I will never have a fulfilling life, and if someone‚Äôs abusive girlfriend is better than me (even when I‚Äôve never abused anyone), I must really be the worst person to ever be on this earth. I don‚Äôt think I deserve to live anymore."

237,"Being a 20 year old, I‚Äôm supposed to be out having fun with friends, finding the girl of my dreams and looking for the job I want to work for the rest of my life. Instead, I‚Äôm losing hair day by day and soon I‚Äôll have to shave it off. (Very soon, probably two months.) it‚Äôs unfair and I don‚Äôt know how to handle it. I‚Äôve been suicidal before and now it‚Äôs all come rushing back. I dread waking up in the morning. I‚Äôm going to be known as ‚Äúthe bald guy‚Äù for at least the next 20 years. Life is unfair and I seem to have lost the genetic lottery. I wish I could just be a normal young man but that will never happen. I miss the person I used to be and I miss the things I used to do. Nowadays, I‚Äôm an empty shell of my old self. Hair loss and depression have taken everything from me and I don‚Äôt see any other way out."
238,I‚Äôm trapped in a vicious circle that never seems to stop. Nothing has gone my way for two years. I‚Äôm a recovering addict. 125 days clean off meth and proud of that but I can‚Äôt ever get my daughter back. My ex husbands family is very wealthy and will pay any amount to make sure I don‚Äôt get her. I love my boyfriend and his kids so much but what I give is never enough. I‚Äôm not enough for them. I don‚Äôt wanna hear about the whole life is worth living. What is worth all this pain. Haven‚Äôt I suffered enough? I want nothing but to just be happy and I‚Äôm a social anxiety nightmare everywhere I go. I feel like everyone is driving me to kill myself and I‚Äôm too scared to do it. All I wish every night is that I can fall asleep and never wake up. Only then will I truly be at peace. There is no more peace for me here on earth. If god was real he wouldn‚Äôt want me to feel like this nor would he do this to me. God is dead. I wish I was too. I‚Äôd literally pay someone to kill me... but we all know that‚Äôs unlikely to happen in this day and age. I don‚Äôt want to be alive anymore.
239,

243,I‚Äôve been thinking abt it and if/when I do commit I really would have no idea what to put in a suicide note. What do most people say in theirs?
244,i can‚Äôt cope i can‚Äôt do it i‚Äôm so fucking exhausted everything feels so heavy i feel like i can‚Äôt breath like all of life‚Äôs problems lays on my chest suffocating me and i told them i had a plan for when i get out but they sent me home anyway it feels like another kick in the ass for a reason to attempt again because they won‚Äôt care if i‚Äôm found dead. i just can‚Äôt fucking do this everyday is exhausting i feel sick with my head my thoughts are so god i can‚Äôt even explain it and i‚Äôm so tired so fucking tired not the tired you can sleep off my bones ache i feel like i‚Äôm strapped down to my bed it took so much energy to attempt just to be saved i don‚Äôt know what to do i just wish they‚Äôd let me die.
245,Does the feeling of wanting to die and the lonelieness ever go away? I've been dealing with depression and suicidal thought since i was 12 and for 5 FUCKING YEARS i just want it to end
246,"I'm honestly just feeling really suicidal and I wanna self harm soo bad that its driving me crazy even tho I've been clean for like 8 months and I can't stop crying. Idk whats wrong with me but I dont have anyone to talk to anyway and I don't wanna mess up again. I feel like such a weird, useless piece of shit thats never gonna do anything good and I feel pathetic for even coming here tbh"
247,"I could never break my mom's heart like that, but I am so exhausted... I guess for those of you going through suicidal thoughts like me, please remember your parents or grandparents, or siblings or closest friend and how devastated and lonely they would be without you.

It's super hard. I know. But I believe things will get better, i really hope so"
248,"Quietly suffering for years from thoughts that would control me everyday, fake laughters and smiles, all the fake Im okays, all the self harm and lies, all the self convincing and confusion is finally coming to an end. Ever since I planned out my suicide, Ive been feeling better. Feeling like this is finally going to stop so I dont have to worry anymore. My days are a bit better. There are times when I feel guilty af because I have both of my parents, little sister, cute dog, 3 out of 4 grandparents and a big family, were not poor, we have quite a big house, we live in a country thats not doing bad at all, I have a job, group of people to hang out with, just got accepted into university and even started visiting a therapist. And here I am planning my fucking suicide. The fact that you gotta pay tons just to feel alright mentally crushes me.
But, honestly, it became so easy to ignore everything and everyone at this point. I wanted to do this for years, and now I finally found the courage. I wrote a letter to my sister and to one friend saying shit like I love them. I prepared diazepam, alcohol and im still getting a load of painkillers. Second part of my plan is a bathtub full of water and unconscious (if not dead yet) me, hopefully."
249,"From my post history you will see someone who is struggling from the darkest depths of one's mind. I cannot take it, I'm sick and tired of being told I'm lazy or I should have a job. Nobody will ever fully understand the pain i am feeling. The only way they will know is when I end my life. Oh and being a 21yr old  with no healthcare in America is a gateway to death I'll never get the treatment I need, It'll save my mother money so she doesn't have to keep up with her sick son and I won't be a jobless burden to anyone. I guess I'll either crash our car into a bridge or get my hands on a gun, I cannot fucking take this shit. Quit saying it gets better because we all know it doesn't,  All my pain can be over in mere seconds. I am venting because I have been failed from the healthcare system I will be another suicide statistic. I'm sick I'm sick I am not okay. I will never work again, pursue a relationship or be anything... I have lost who I was. I've worked on a suicide video to give my friends and family a few weeks ago because it gives me comfort. Just fucking kill me."
250,I finished my notes. Just wanted to let someone know. I can‚Äôt deal with the pain but I do wish that she stays happy. She did choose him over me.
251,"Hello, I'm just simply asking for advice on here if that is okay.
I have a lover who I very much love and hold close dearly, I love them very much.
I won't share too much info about my partner, but they went through a lifetime of hardships and putting themselves in self-destructive situations like self-harm and starvation. They'd rather have no body care for them, but rathermore have that go towards others. 
I've had my fair share of depression and being suicidal, so I know how that is and managed to help them through tough times.
But I'm still worried, they're very self-destructive and self-degrading and they struggle with opening up about their problems, thoughts, and feelings. And then there is me, a perfectly happy, and energetic person. 
To make matters worse, my lover is long-distance, they live states away from me. So what I can really do is limited, so what can I do? I'm doing my best and doing all the right things, like comfort, treating them humanely, and giving them their own time and space to speak about it. Yet, I'm still worried.

This is my first time using Reddit, so i understand if I somehow broke a few guidelines or did something wrong, but thank you anyways."

I‚Äôm just ready to go see my pops again. The only person in this world that cares about me is my grandma who is not doing great health wise at all. All I do now is seem to find trouble and I don‚Äôt even mean to get in it. I‚Äôm Fixing to go to jail because I violated my probation for a weed pen and picked up a domestic violence case even though my sister hit me first. I just can‚Äôt anymore. I‚Äôm so done with my shitty life"
254,"please help me i feel like theres no othher option but suicide at this point.

i live with my dad who can be so abusive to me but i cant move in with my mother because I used to live with her and she was also equally abusive in different ways. 

i do health and social care studies (im 27 i left it so late in life and i hate myself) One guy i met asked me why im doing studies still at 27 and I told him because I left it too late and I wanted to do it now his response was ""why are you stupid or something?"" Im so embarrassed i wish i never did this my life is ruined its too late to start a new or even try

I'm too old to be studying I hate my life I wanted to be a therapist it will never happen

 and i have been offered a job from my best and only friend to do personal care in a care home for a few hours a week. I do not want to do personal care I never have. I got into health and social to try to become a therapist but now I think I wasted so many years on the wrong course. My best friend said please dont let her down because its her name attached to this and they have given me opportunities that are hard to come by in this day and age.

with all the abuse at home and now this i see no other way out it was already ahrd enough

and now i am about to let my best friend down she will never forgive me or trust me again

i cant see any other way out 

i already felt like this for a long time because even my therapists were struggling to help me because of my home situations and I'm an adult so they can't help in the same way they would someone who is a child or a teenager.

also i dont want my family to get into trouble so i refuse to report them 

My dad wants to keep me a prisoner forever

and i cant return to my other family

i am trapped in this life

the one person i had is my best friend btu now i feel trapped by the job

i have nothing left

i feel like killing myself 

but i will speak to my therapist soon and tell her idk

I see no way out i just need advice"
255,i just sat in the car for an hour with my younger sister talking about how miserable we are and how much we hate our dad.. my siblings and i all have mental health issues bc of him and half of us have self harmed or tried to commit suicide. it killed me to here my sister cry about the things he says and does to us. i‚Äôm super emotional and cry literally every time i talk about him or even talk to him. but she‚Äôs always so mature and calm about stuff even tho i know she gets upset and has panic attacks later. i‚Äôm scared for them i‚Äôm 18 and and other than my older sister who moved out i‚Äôm the oldest in the house. we always thought my older sister was crazy bc she would do all kinds of weird stuff and she‚Äôd always be yelling at my dad but a few years ago i found out it was because she was the one who found out my dad was cheating my mom. idk how old she was but probably around 13 or 14. she got really bad she had to go to one of those mental health hospital places. so yea i want to call cps to get my siblings out of here but they don‚Äôt want that and i‚Äôm scared of what would happen to my mom and me. my mom tries really hard but she‚Äôs in school rn and doesn‚Äôt really have time for us.. my dad makes her cry all the time and that hurts me more than anything. i‚Äôm not that close with her i don‚Äôt think ive hugged her more than once or twice my whole life but i love her so much.. my dads not physically abusive towards us and he likes to act like that‚Äôs some kind of achievement bc his dad used to beat him. i try to get as many hours as possible at work so i‚Äôm not at home around him but i work a part time job so i‚Äôm still home a lot. he mostly just yells at us to clean the house which me and one of my sisters do but he lets my 2 youngest siblings do whatever they want and the sink has maggots in it and mold and the kitchen is full of flies and just going down their and cleaning i have a panic attack after like an hour. then there‚Äôs the tv room where the 2 youngest hang out and there‚Äôs just food everywhere and mold and the carpet is destroyed and i know if cps came they would get taken away. me and my sister clean it like once a week usually but it doesn‚Äôt matter how many times we steam clean the carpet it‚Äôs always disgusting and as soon as it‚Äôs clean they destroy it again. i don‚Äôt want to leave my siblings alone here but i don‚Äôt think i‚Äôll ever make it out of here. i hate him and i hate myself for not being able to do anything.. i m scared to die but im more scared to stay here.ive tried to kill myself before and idk if id try again but i want to and i think about it everyday.i remember the first time i tried i took a bunch of random pills and just waited and i was scared and wanted to ask for help but i didnt and it probably took me 12 hours before i realized i wasnt gonna die and i was just mad at myself. im scared that if i killed myself one of siblings would too or my dad would get worse and i would just make everything worse for everyone but at the same time maybe everything would get better bc maybe he could see what he was doing to us..i know im selfish and im sorry but idk know what to do...
256,"This is a different type of post. I am not ugly, or shy, or have bad luck with women. I am an 38M Indian man. In Indian culture high school dating is strictly prohibited.

I graduated High School not being allowed to go to a single dance (wasn't allowed) and never had been kissed.

My lack of sexual experience hindered me in college so I never tried. To summarize my 20s, I applied to medical school after college, did not get in, so I did a Ph.D in Biology which took 7 years. At 29 I applied to medical school again and got in. ***During my 20s, due to my virginity I also became a porn addict.  I also became obese in my 20s.***

I did Internal Medicine Residency for 3 years (***during which i changed my diet and worked out becoming in good shape***) then Oncology (Cancer Doctor) for another 4 (including a research year). ***I lost my virginity to a hooker. I also hired a ""sexual surrogate"" (basically a ""intimacy/sex"" teacher---GOOGLE IT) to ""teach"" me how to kiss/have sex.*** ***I had a 2 short relationships but my sexual inexperience ruined them.***

257,"I am nothing but baggage to people! Everyone who has been my friend regrets it.. i am nothing but a big burden pn everyone!

How can i be still alive why cant i just end it! I have an entire bag full of pills for different things!

Would it end if i eat all of them together? I am just worried about what will happen if i dont die! What will i say to everyone if by any small chance i recover?"
258,"Basically no one listens to me when I say I need help. This is the only way I can get anyone‚Äôs attention. So please give me some tips on how to attemp (best ways, etc) but to survive 

f.e. I take a bunch of pills but someone saves me and calls 911 before I‚Äôm dead"
259,"Why is everyone else here? How do you guys hold on? I feel like I'm going to give up any day now, with no real plan beyond some kind of cathartic ending that leaves everyone with very little closure or comfort. I finally convinced my doctors to take me off all my medication in March, something I was in fact very proud about. I was actually feeling really great, right up until I tried to kill myself on April 17th.

Every day since then has been anxiety attacks and violent thoughts towards myself, with an underlying inability to cope with even the smallest inconveniences. It's important to mention that I don't think of my suicide attempt as a mistake, just a failure. Had there been any success I wouldn't be whining to you guys now. It's simply the misery of knowing I'm still alive when I have no reason to live that really kills me. The one thing that haunted me the worst after I survived, wasn't a memory or effect, or anything I had felt; I just couldn't stop wondering why I am still alive.

It's been 77 days since I tried, and every day I've wanted to try again. I finally gave in and decided to talk to my doctor about medications, because the anxiety attacks that have followed my suicide attempt have made living basically unbearable. What once was a mildly off putting occasional gift, became a consistent plight on regular life, and somehow I still can't help but feel like I'm giving up. I was so proud of getting off medication and now that I feel myself about to have to go on them again I feel like I'm moving backwards. All this progress for nothing, and all that.

Then again it's the apathy that really hits me the hardest. I don't want to do anything. I don't want to talk to people anymore, I don't want to watch movies anymore. I don't want to play video games anymore, or work out, or research, or anything else I'd loved so much. I don't even want to sleep, but sleeping is the easiest way to ignore everything else, so it's all I ever end up doing. Fuck I feel so close to the end and I don't even have it in me to want to roll over, I just want to lay in place and day. But I can't, so I just keep living."
260,"I have hit my rock bottom today!i dont think i have fallen this deep ever... or maybe i have i dont know

261,"I looked down at the bottle of Lexapro and wanted to take them all...

264,"I tried to respond to a few posts on here to reach out. And I have no idea what I was thinking because obviously I can‚Äôt help anyone. I am such a hypocrite. Who am I to encourage another to live while I am barely doing that myself? 

Honestly, I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs stopping me. I know what to do. I know where the stuff I need is. And I have the means. And I know I still have a good hour until my husband comes home. And honestly I want to do it. Just end it. Say fuck it. Say goodbye. 

I‚Äôm on the fucking edge and I just want to tip over. I also know that if I can make it, just another hour, my husband will be home and the opportunity for today will have passed...but then I‚Äôll be back here again tomorrow. Same thing. The distractions I use in order to survive are no longer working. 

I am so fucking empty. Torn up. I‚Äôve moved past the point of desperation to die and entered the point of a matter of when. 

I told myself I made a commitment to living, problem is that I only made that commitment for the sake of my husband. I don‚Äôt know that I can continue to hold true to that commitment."
265,"Lately, I've been feeling as shitty about myself as the time I checked into a mental rehab not too long ago. I felt better after it for a solid 3 months, but I feel like going back to work triggered my thoughts again.

266,"I‚Äôm so tired.  I hate myself.  I ruin everything I touch and I‚Äôm actively ruining my life.  I‚Äôm always high.  Or drunk.  Since my dad died I‚Äôve been so paranoid about people dying even ages from now (including myself).  But now I‚Äôm not scared about it.  Not for me, really.  I think I deserve that or worse.  Right now I am here for my husband, our cats, and my sister.  I tried to get help this past week but my dr just took me off my mood stabilizer cuz I didn‚Äôt think it was doing anything.  I didn‚Äôt feel heard or cared about.  Then the next day I finally get in to see a therapist and ugh it was so awkward.  She was super nice tho I just think it was just Awkward for us both due to age and professions.  Idk.  
So basically I need a new therapist and I just don‚Äôt even feel like calling to switch.  What if this isn‚Äôt a fit too? I don‚Äôt want to do anything really.  I kinda just want to head to the fucking mountains with a shit ton of weed and beer just smoke/drink my way through that so I have some balls until I eventually kill my self.  

Idk if I should figure out a plan tomorrow or tonight for how I am going to get the help I need or if I should just give up. I‚Äôm so sick of feeling this way for my entire life"
267,"Sorry if this isn‚Äôt allowed or is the wrong place. I‚Äôll go ahead and put a TW just in case: TW: intent.

268,"I am a teenager who has a family that is full of people with extreme anxiety and depression, we have no friends really and all I do is sit on the computer. I have tried seeing many therapists but now I am too depressed to even want to get better; not to mention whenever I do something someone else would qualify as ""fun"" I just feel emptiness. The only emotion I really seem to feel is anger and sadness. I have thought about this a lot and honestly to me nothingness seems better than waking up everyday to a boring life of eating and then being on the computer for hours. I have tried so many drugs, the legal kind, at this point that I don't believe any of them will help me. They say there is help for people like me but I guess I am to depressed to ask for it. Probably the only reason I am still here is because I know my mom really cares for me and loves me, whatever love feels like it seems I have forgotten. The only place I can go is to the hospital where they will take away my shoelaces and everything else treat me like a 5 year old and probably drive me insane. It seems like a lot less work not to bother with living anymore, why does the world need me its already extremely overpopulated. I don't want to deal with our fucked up society anymore, or the idea of going to some outrageously expensive college even though my high school gives college level courses for free. I have a feeling there is going to be a huge wave of suicide because of this isolation bullshit, I might be part of it. There is no good reason to live when your so fucked up and depressed you can't get better without going through torture and tons of medical bills. I guess I am just fucked, much like another teenagers addicted to computer games with no friends and no social skills. Not to mention my parents are trying to force me to get a job, I am applying everywhere, but because I am under 18 with no work experience no one wants to hire me. So if nobody needs me, I'll guess I'll just leave. Have fun dealing with this fucked up world."

272,I've had enough of this life. I don't think I was meant to live to 20. My heart is so heavy and I'm ready to feel nothing at all. I'm not even panicked like I thought I'd be. Knowing I'm near the end is oddly calming.

I don‚Äôt want to make any changes to better my health, I don‚Äôt want to go to a doctor, I don‚Äôt care about any of that bullshit. I just wish I could die in my sleep one night.

And as far as a girlfriend, let‚Äôs just say I am the least well endowed person on the entire planet, so we all know how that goes.

275,I just took two 60mgprozacs and like mouthfuls of Jack Daniel and i feel so happy dudes. Im sorry for doing this. Maybe this happiness is what i need to keep going in a weird way? idk. Im sorry
276,"First off I would like to say that I am well aware of the fact that I have it better off than probably most people who post here. I'm not trying to be entitled or anything. But it goes to show that even if you're given everything you need by your family you can still feel this way. My case in point.

I'm 19, and I still live with either my mom and stepdad or grandparents (I go between the two places). I was raised with everything I might need, and have lived a comfortable life. However, last September, I began to feel different. That was my first semester in college, and I really didn't like the major I was in. I wanted to get out of it, and so I did. After 2nd semester I officially changed my major to something maybe I might enjoy(?). But nonetheless, I still feel terrible.

That first semester my grades were subpar, at least for my standards. But I began to feel like I was never going to go anywhere. I couldn't see my future, and I still can't. I began to lose motivation to do anything, and now I barely even have the motivation/will to live. Yesterday was the first day I told anyone in my family, my mom, that I had very little will to live.

I was forced into doing so, but yesterday I applied for several jobs. I haven't had an official job before, just miscellaneous things I did for family members and got paid some cash for. My mom said it would somehow make me better. But hell, I don't even have the motivation to do that. I feel like I can't do something everyone else can; it's not that I don't feel I'm capable, but with my mental state I'm not sure I can. And because of this, I feel absolutely pathetic. I don't feel that forcing me to do something I have no will to do is going to make me feel any better. Just look at the fact I'm living-- well I guess no one is forcing me to live, but every day I feel worse and worse, because I almost don't want to anymore.

I knew this day was going to come, but I didn't think it would be so soon. I never really imagined being this close to wanting to end everything, at least not yet. Like I said before, I couldn't see my future, and so I imagined I probably wouldn't last long after I graduate. I wondered why I'm even going to school anyways if that's how it's gonna end.

I get chastised often by my mom for being on my PC all day or playing video games, but there's a reason for this. When I'm doing these things, I at least forget about my troubles and feel happy for once. But obviously I can't live like that forever, and I don't know what else I can do when that life comes to an end.

The only few reasons I continue to feel like living is because I want to continue being with my friends, and I love to watch new TV series or videos online, and read comics. But obviously I can't do that when I'm dead. But I guess when you're dead you don't really care. But in addition to this, I have just a very minuscule shard of hope that things will get better. But I fail to see this become more likely with each day. 

People might suggest therapy, counseling, or talking to a helpline; my mom told me when school starts back up, she'll help me get a counselor on campus. But what exactly are they going to do? I doubt they could do much, if anything. Just talking isn't going to help me, so I think that things like a helpline or counselor won't really help.

When I told my mom I didn't feel much will to live anymore, I absolutely burst into tears. I can't even remember the last time I'd done that, but I was being absolutely sincere when I said it. It was so hard for me to actually get it out of my mouth, too. My mom just said it was fear, but I don't think that's totally true. What I'm scared of isn't my future, but instead is the fact I can't see myself having one. I feel like I just am not ready for life. It's not like I chose to be born, no one was. But at this point, if I had known my life was gonna come to this point, I honestly don't think I would've chosen to be. 

I just can't think of anything that can help me. Again, every day I feel worse and worse. I know I said I have a few things that keep me feeling like I want to live, but eventually I think this feeling of not wanting to anymore will overcome those things. So, why do I even bother anymore?"
277,I've had enough of everything. Everyday is painful and it just keeps getting worse. I don't want to do it anymore. I live in the UK and I'm quite young so I don't really know how I can end my life properly. Can anyone help?
278,"I can't hang myself because there's no where high enough. I can't take pills because my mom locked them all away. I won't cut myself because that has a low success rate, and would be extremely painful. I can't suffocate myself with a bag because I get too scared and chicken out. Anyone got any ideas?"
279,"I'm sat here with the knot around my neck, ready to kill myself... I've written out my notes and everything, but I cant work up the fucking courage to actually do it. I keep thinking to myself what if I'm found too soon and wake up but with debilitating issues, or what if my family sees me in some horrific state... but at this point I feel that my choices are either this, or a life of being an alcoholic or drug abuser, and I dont want to live like that..."
280,"i have ptsd/cptsd from being abused since birth until i turned 14 and was taken into cps custody (almost a year ago) 
i recently lied to my friends (not with ill intent) because i was scared and i hurt everyone deeply. im slipping back into old habits but worse so badly. i think ive gotten all the medical help that i can, and im as healed as ill ever be.
but its not healed enough.
the only things i have to live for are my boyfriend and dog. i hurt him too however, hes not upset but im upset.

honestly i just wanna sleep and never ever get up. it feels like the only chance of peace ill have is through the bullet."
281,"I wasn't thinking about suicide for a fucking month. But everything's changed again, my parents are fighting constantly and my report card came back with the lowest grades I've ever fucking gotten. And here I am, wishing we had enough pills to actually do *something* for once in my pathetic fucking life. 

Everyone I know would be better off without me. My parents wouldn't try and stick together for me, despite them being miserable, my teachers wouldn't have to waste time on me and my friends wouldn't have to try and stay in contact with me. They'd be so much happier.

I'm just so done. I hate living like this. I hate myself. I hate everything about this fucked up world. I don't want to keep trying. *I'm so fucking done.*"
282,"Let me tell you my sad story im 21 male well in september (if i live to then) got drugged sexually assaulted by another male in a foreign country so i dropped  out of med school and returned home they filmed video and spread it in my hometown not only that but they hacked my pc and recorded me saying to mum i got raped and spread aswell now everyone blames me for it fun fact im 6ft8 everyone outside bullies me for it
Conclusion : destroyed academical life 
                       Destroyed social and most of all destroyed mental health .
For shit like this suicide is a good way out solution."
283,I‚Äôm in a spot where I bounce between contemplating suicide and believing in myself that I can grow and move past my struggles. But today has just been so draining and even though I met with my new therapist and was hopefully now I just feel like nobody understands or cares what I‚Äôm going through. I had recently stopped taking my medication so I have been dealing with withdrawal symptoms which are very scary and uncomfortable but being off them allows me to experience a wild range of emotions I haven‚Äôt been able to feel in a long time.

287,"Quick summary! I am only 21 y.o. but I have a lot going on! Intergenerational trauma on my mother's side of the family. Pure evil on the important (to my existence) father's side of the family - to the point where my father tried to kill my mother and me and he may have killed my dog. My mother is chronically ill. I have been more than half my life in poverty. The house she and I live in belongs legally to my father and only to him. I've studied a university degree that can only worsen my mental health. My life is an unfunny joke, I have self-hate, depression, cPTSD, chronic sleep insomnia, overall horrible health, terrible coping mechanisms, etc. I miss my dog so much. And so much stuff that is left out of the summary.


I have no agency in my life and today a close friend who knows this shamed me/ tried to persuade me not to kill myself. I mean??? I'm only human!!? There's people who can't handle one relatively minor thing such as being a virgin and I am supposed to carry all these baggage all my life?? Fuck you world, fuck you family, fuck my lack of help and agency."
288,"Recently my ex has come back up after breaking it off for about a year saying sorry about everything and says her grandparents (whom are racist dirtbags whom abused her in an incredible fashion that nearly sends me into a rage) said I spread her nudes and lied about evidence to split us up and get emotions overwhelm her and she believes them when she should believe me far more. Apon returning she barely talks to me, taking 10+ minutes at least 90% of the time to respond with me always being there person to start the conversation and recently my grandfather passed and it hit me pretty hard. She went to the viewing with me and we spent some time together afterwards and cheered each other up and some of our old love and chemistry showing itself when I asked for a hug in my car (I'm loving and very tactile) and it turned into a cuddle. Next came his ceremony where he got his honor gaurd and the last time we'd say goodbye before cremation and being put to rest with other soldiers and she couldn't come but we made plans the previous day that we'd spend time together and I texted her in the morning and on the way home from the ceremony with no answer, come about 8 at night she finally comes back up saying yeah let's go out but when I show up she isn't there and says she went out for fireworks. She knows I'm in extreme pain although not likely knowing that I'm toying with a knife thinking of it's blade piercing my neck in my car outside her house. She eventually tells me to go home because she has to talk to her housemates parents and we plan for tomorrow but she never responds a time even though its not even 9 yet. You can guess that tomorrow I get no response so at about 4 today I texted her accusing her off playing with me and similar stuff and her response is that she was helping her grandmother (that I was talking about earlier) plan her funeral, the day I was at my grandfather's funeral. Apparently she was doing that today as well even though she made plans with me AGAIN. The only fights we've had is because she listens to her grandparents and she lets her emotions get the best of her and this time it wasn't a misunderstanding, she accused me of not caring when she ignored me knowing I was in pain for two days and yet she never fills me in on anything doesn't talk to me or give any real effort. 

Thank you for reading this all the way through and while I'll probably ignore it I wouldn't mind someone putting in their two cents"
289,"when i close my eyes all i see is my body hanging, wrists slashed like a hog made to be bled out.

290,"I think this is the worst day of my life. 
I watched all Dr K and Reckful videos about his depression and they gave me a lot of hope. He seemed fine in his latest videos, and said he was genuinely happy after lunching his game. Got the news of his suicide on 7am, just 1 hour and a half before my driving license exam, which I worked so hard to pass, and failed because I was so out of it. As they say, suicide is contagious and I'm making a big effort to not fuck it up.

I've been depressed for almost 2 years now and when I was close to taking the fast exist I went to the doctor because that seemed like the only other solution to the problem. (This was on February)
The doctor gave me an appointment with a psych 3 months later, so I waited patiently with that date in my mind to remain strong. Then corona happened and it was delayed another 3 more months, being the new date the 7th of July. Some relatives have talked very recently about their medical appointments being cancelled because of little corona infections happening again and I'm so terrified. I'm to o scared to call and ask if it has been canceled. I don't think I can do this until September alone.
I also have the university entrance exam on 6th of July (2 days left) and I haven't even started to study because I simply can't do it so I have probably already ruined my future.

I just need something to tie me here, an upvote, a comment, something to watch at 4 am high and drunk wanting it all to end. Please, I beg you.
I will post updates every two days at least"
291,"I just feel like life is too much, and that work or tedious tasks make me wanna end it. It just sucks having to do work to live. I feel like humans were put on Earth to enjoy it, not to be monitored constantly through forms of work or school. It just kind of halts life and makes us stress out over completely artifical things created by humans. This is a world I don't want to live in if it means I have to work just to exist. I could understand easier work such as working enough for food and family but this isn't the case for many as we are debt slaves."
292,"I need friends, I feel bad, we can talk about stuff and not being toxic. What about best friends? You might be far but I don't really care. I just need someone to talk to and care, I'll try my best.

I wanna die, I wanna cut, but I don't want to, I don't want to fall in this shit again, please, please. I will check this reddit in the morning when I unhopefully wake up.

And somehow sometimes I convince myself that I'm faking it."
293,"I just got let go from my job, just as I thought my life couldn‚Äôt get any worse. It time for me. I‚Äôm going to go buy a gun, and end it all. I can‚Äôt take the pain, the loneliness, and frustration anymore. I‚Äôm going to get evicted from my apartment with no where to go. When people tell you that it gets better, what they really mean is it just keeps getting worse and worse until you get to a point where your tired of the disappointment."
294,"I tried to kill myself twice in my yet so young life. I don¬¥t have any hope left that it will get better. I¬¥ve been struggling with mental health a big part of my life and I don¬¥t bring up the motivation anymore to even try to get better. I¬¥m stuck being traumatized by the past and not wanting to continue to see the future. Any time I got happy or thought that it maybe has gotten better, I fell even deeper. I don't know what to do anymore. I'm clueless and hopeless."
295,"Last night my boyfriend started slamming my head into the head board of our bed. And I punched him in the face to get him off of me.. he DOES NOT remember doing that to me all he remembers is I punched him. So now he broke up with me and is throwing me out of our house. I have been throw so damn much throughout my life. From being a mother to my own mother for over a decade, to abuse, and now to loose someone I had a reason to live for. Now I have nothing. I have planned this for a while.. I have everything prepared. I'm just trying to get the courage to do so. I want to apologize to my parents. But my heart has been broken. I have no one to talk to. And I am so alone. Honestly, no one needs me. If it wasn't for the letter I sent no one would even know I'd be gone. I've made peace with myself, and with God. He doesn't really speak to me. However, that's alright. I've made peace with that as well."

297,"I was considering putting this on r/offmychest but you tend to feel kinda bad putting your post next to the handful of posts filled with happy people who just so happened to get engaged during a freaking pandemic.

Life isn't really good atm. Not like 'virus is about, society is collapsing' bad, but like 'Life is soup, I am fork' bad. It's like if God decided Jesus' death wasn't enough and decided to hand select me to die on cross #2 for post-armageddon's sins. 

Yours truly was abused and bullied up until he was about 14 to 15 years old. I was considering jumping off an apartment when I was 14. Strawberry sauce at ground floor, yknow? I didn't really want to die just yet... I decided to make 'the choice'.

If u spray a field with DEET chemicals, insects in the field either die or adapt. Apparently being the unwanted insect that nobody wanted, I chose to adapt. Every day HURTS, but I still keep going yknow? I wanted friends, grades, happiness... And I worked hard at getting them. I fought hard to get my grades straight... Tried to make myself happy...

Then I realised... Not a lot of people like me. I live on a different plane of existence, where I can't mingle or talk with people without sacrificing who I truly am. When I try to change my attitude... my approach... they still don't stay.

When you're nice, they take your stuff and leave. When you're mean, they stay a little longer! But only so they can deliver the 'last say' if you catch my drift. 
When you stop saying anything and let them come to you, they don't come! And when you try a little too hard, you're annoying. I never really felt comfortable or significantly happy at all. 

I tried everything. I didn't care if I was worth it or not, I'm going to have a happy life regardless! No one's obligated to talk to me? Well, people talked to me anyways! 'Once you get friends, you're in the matrix!' Why I would love a large helping of blue pills, Mr mental health guru. 

This isn't it. I'm just so upset and sewer slidal (my phone autocorrected that I'm keeping it). I'm set for a happy-ish life but right now, I'm just a couple few barbequeues short of a smiley guy. 

Come to think of it, strawberry sauce seems like a pretty good option atm."
298,"I used to be so depressed that I fucking gave up on everything contemplated suicide in the sense that I wanted to kill myself because I found no interest in life, but also didn't want to kill myself because I didn't care enough about anything. 

There is one thing I've always cared about though, weakness, and one day I took a look at myself and I realised that for multiple reasons even aside from my depression I was pathetically weak and I hated it.

That was it, it's that hate that drove me forwards every single day to go outside of my comfort zone to be stronger. 

I am absolutely disgusted by my weakness. So much so, that I dont care how long it takes, or how much longer I have to stay here and work and struggle, I will one day eradicate all of my weakness. 

Hatred may be a strong poison, but it's an even stronger fuel."
299,"I just don‚Äôt know what to do anymore.

It sucks that noones given the option of being born. And you can‚Äôt even leave life because every fucking way hurts people and yourself.

I‚Äôve had depression my whole life and this year has been the worst for me. I hate it. I‚Äôm stuck inside and I don‚Äôt want to go outside because seeing everyone standing apart and all the masks just makes me so depressed. Depressed knowing that this is what life is going to be like from now on. 

When school starts up again it‚Äôs gonna suck. It‚Äôs either shitty online school or standing 6 feet from everyone and not being able to really do anything. It‚Äôs not worth it. It‚Äôll be my final year, and it‚Äôll be wasted.

Everyday it just gets worse and worse, and even when I talk to friends and have fun, there‚Äôs still an underlying feeling of complete despair. And it always is there. I don‚Äôt feel at all like anything is worth living for and I wish that there was some way I could just - disappear. Painlessly and without making anyone sad I wish I could just be gone from existence. 

Nothing is truly fun anymore; and I have no drive to to anything. I just keep thinking that I wish I was dead.."
300,"i‚Äôm in so much pain, he broke up with me after my friend had screenshots of him trying to have sex with her. idk what to do. how would i even be able to deal with this, why am i not good enough? i don‚Äôt want to be alone anymore and i wish i was dead. i wish i was never born."
301,"So I poured a bottle of sleeping pills and a bottle of ibuprofen pm into a contigo 20oz canister, filled it with water and, well....

I'm not sure if I'll wake up some I was wondering if someone could notify next of kin in the morning (SoCal PST here) just in case.

This is serious."
302,"I‚Äôm 18 and I just graduated high school recently, sure I got a whole life ahead of me but, I don‚Äôt see myself living past 20. My depression has been on and off since I‚Äôve been escaping to video games, anime, and music but recently it‚Äôs just unbearable. Crying to myself to sleep almost every night, I‚Äôm just done with life. I know I need help, I‚Äôm just a scared because if I do, my mom will make a big deal out of it and I‚Äôll feel even more of a burden. I‚Äôm a coward for not seeking help and not being able to end my life."

304,"i said something kinda bad a while back but didnt realise it, i just realised a friend i have kinda hates me. my heart is beating really fast and i feel like dying. i know im not gonna die because im such a fucking pussy but i still cant help but have the thoughts.."
305,"I‚Äôm a 15F and I can‚Äôt handle life anymore. Im only living for my parents and friends because I know that they will be sad when I‚Äôm dead, but I feel like they don‚Äôt care about me now. I attempted suicide a few times in the past and I wish that it worked. Im currently considering killing myself, but I doubt that I will actually go through with it. Im privileged as shit and I have nothing to complain about, but I still feel like my life is unbearable. It takes something small to ruin my day and it takes something big to make me happy. I don‚Äôt enjoy any of my hobbies anymore and everything feels like a chore. I keep doing stupid things like over eatting or self harming and I always expect them to make me happy, but they never do.  I tried opening up to people about my problems, but no one took me seriously or gave a shit. I just don‚Äôt know what to do."
306,"Hey idk how to start really I've just been sad for the most part not like unmovable sad but just sad for a good solid year and I can't really rely on anyone I've had people who I've spoke too and they all just end up leaving my parents don't care my family don't either. I'm just getting to the point where its too much to cope with living and I've been thinking of it just hanging myself no blood no mess just nice and simple but the only thing holding me back is my dog and a girl and idk how long she'll be in my life for she knows I'm sad but not to the extent of suicide but I guess that's how most people are you don't see the real side of them.
Thanks for reading but you could've spent this time helping someone important"
307,"My whole life i‚Äôve just lost people. Everyone, has just been taken away from me in one way or another. My mother died of cancer, I lost my step siblings and stepdad when she died, I lost all of my friends after having to move 4 hours away to live with my dad, except he cheated on his fiance so I lost my main mother figure and my other step siblings. Moved schools again and lost more friends, I finally started to settle down and get comfortable with my surroundings after moving into a new apartment but of course my dad knocked up his new girlfriend and she moved us halfway across the country. I started my first romantic relationship which went south very quickly after he used suicide as a manipulation tactic. After being helped out of that I got with another friend who I was with for a long time, they admitted to only staying with me at the end because I seemed willing to have sex. I wasnt. I then finally found someone absolutely perfect. A dream. Of course, because everything in my life glitters and is never gold, after 2 years he decides he just wants to be single despite still being in love. I haven‚Äôt been able to maintain a regular friendship in years and part of me wonders if its for the best. If I should just leave everything behind because nothing is going to change and i‚Äôm tired of losing people for no reason. I‚Äôm tired of the pain, I just want it to stop. Even so, the cancer my mother had was genetic. I‚Äôll probably be stage 4 by the end of college"
308,"I want to die 

I guess I‚Äôm posting because I‚Äôm so alone. I have so many people I could reach out to but I don‚Äôt want to be a burden. I feel like shit. 



I need help and can‚Äôt ask for it. 

I just want to die. Why can‚Äôt I just have never existed?



Edit: I want to cut so bad. Thank god im not home but also I‚Äôm so afraid for my boyfriend to catch me crying. 

I want to go home and cut. Maybe then I‚Äôd be able to sleep.


Edit 2 bc why not: this is so damn pathetic. Could have had a good evening? Wtf triggered me to ruin this?"
309,"I‚Äôve been a long time sufferer of anxiety and depression. I‚Äôm at a point in my life now where I no longer fear death, in fact , I think about death/not existing and fantasize about it all the time. I see photos of before I was born and I can‚Äôt help but get so happy an nostalgic at a world where I didn‚Äôt exist. In conjunction with that, I constantly focus on ways to make my non-existence a reality. I hurt knowing I would leave my children behind, but the hurt and pain I feel about everything else is far worse and just not livable anymore. Im just tired of ‚Äúbeing‚Äù and ‚Äúexisting‚Äù. It‚Äôs exhausting. 

I had hopes of when I went into surgery a few months ago that I wouldn‚Äôt ever wake up again and I was so at peace with that. My doctors told me I was the calmest patient they ever saw before a surgery. Of course I was, I was so happy to be put under and escape this life in hopes I wouldn‚Äôt return. But here I am. 

I also fantasize about how much shit my coworkers talk of me... rationalizing even more how worthless I am and not deserving of the life I have. My family would be fine... this I do know. 

I had a close call a few days ago when a car coming the opposite direction crossed the yellow line and I have never felt more calm than in that moment. I was so ready. 

I‚Äôm chicken shit for being a pussy about how to kill myself... but I fantasize about how I would do it all the time. It consumes any spare time I have. I intentionally block times off to think and imagine a world where I don‚Äôt exist. 

I get so excited when I have the house to myself, too. I slam my head into the corners of the walls and will starve myself as punishment. It feels so good to do these things. 

I look forward to not existing. At least that is something that‚Äôs a given. It‚Äôs all I look forward to and fantasize about."
310,
311,"I feel like down to my bone marrow I'm destined to somehow find a way to fuck everything up. It's like ingrained into my being. My thought turns into action (or lack of), action turns into consequences. Sabotage is my essence. I drove my best friend to wanting to kill himself, because I'm not there for him. I'm not there for myself. Im pretending to be me, I lost my confidence and I'm always in my head, which manifests into my relationships. I have to pretend to be some form of myself, and it never works out. Whenever I feel like i'm doing something right, my brain finds a way to throw some information at me that fucks me up. Tried meditating, cognitive behavioral stuff, diet and exercise, but I always end up back at the same spot. This shit seems to affect me on all perceivable levels."
312,I have nothing left to live for because my life gets worse and worse each week. This year of my life is somehow more painful than the year I was stalked and sexually assaulted. My roommates hate me and they were what kept me from suicide bc I knew finding me dead would kill them now I know they wouldn‚Äôt be too bothered by it at all. The decision to end my life is pretty easy now.
313,"Im really scared. But its a dilema. I know its what everyone is telling me to do, its what the universe is asking, but im too coward."
314,"Yeah I‚Äôm done I‚Äôve basically decided that I can‚Äôt have any nice things anymore. I wanna hurt myself so bad and I‚Äôm not sure if I can control the urge. Life is utterly meaningless to me because when I try to give it meaning everything goes down the drain because I‚Äôm a piece of garbage. I can‚Äôt have nice things because when I do I‚Äôm always below someone else. I can‚Äôt be close to someone without there being some sort of catch. I can‚Äôt live my life without every day messing something up. I‚Äôm so done and I‚Äôve pretty much accepted that. I keep telling myself I‚Äôm gonna kill myself and I don‚Äôt know when or how or what but yeah. I can‚Äôt live life like this. I‚Äôm trying to get help and I don‚Äôt even think I will hurt myself but I can‚Äôt just have a normal relationship with someone. It has to come at the cost of being abused mentally, being seen as lower than their other friends, or something or anything. I‚Äôm so tired and my biggest wish I wish could be granted is just to pretty much sleep forever. It‚Äôd be amazing because there‚Äôs no pain but also no waking up to how cruel this world can be. People I love have made things worse and I don‚Äôt know why. Maybe I deserve this"
315,"My birthday wish is to be done with this lifelong struggle. I'm writing my notes to my family, but I'm on the fence about the man who's been my FWB for the past 2 years."
316,"I have considered suicide for a long time now, but this week was the limit.

This week my teacher told me I wasn‚Äôt going to graduate. As the only one of my class I had to stay at home and it hurt me so much when I saw pictures being shared on social media. They all seemed so happy and I was at home crying about what a failure I am. I seriously can‚Äôt do another year in school because it will mentally break me. I‚Äôd rather die than go to that school for another year. 

In the graduation pictures I saw A (I don‚Äôt want to use her name), a girl i‚Äôve been in love with for 2 years, but off course she doesn‚Äôt love me. Why would she? How can she love me if I can‚Äôt even love myself? We were so good friends but I ruined everything when I told her how I felt. I blame myself so much for ruining everything. The worst thing is that I feel so comforted by her, that now when I need it the most I can‚Äôt turn to her anymore. 

To be honest I haven‚Äôt felt happy in 3 years now and I don‚Äôt see any change any time soon. I just hate myself, I hate everything about me. I feel useless, unloved, ashamed of who I am and unwanted. I just wake up everyday wishing I would‚Äôve died in my sleep. I just want the suffering to end.

I also have been to psychologist for almost a year now. I think it‚Äôs the most useless thing to do because if I tell her I want to commit suicide they‚Äôll just put me in a mental hospital."
317,"i just wanted to be loved, i just wanted to care and be cared about. i wanted to love someone who loves me, who finds me enjoyable, who would wake up in the morning and think of me and be happy i exist. i wanted to wake up and have a purpose. to be someones muse or reason or joy. to find someone who wants to know how i tick just as much as i explore how they do. someone who thinks about me, and i think about them. i just wanted love that was bright,  warm, peaceful, calm, for someone to find me enough."
318,"i tried to od last night, i guess i didn't take enough since obviously i'm here but nobody even noticed."
319,"I don‚Äôt really have anybody to talk to and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm in a bad enough place to call my therapist... so I‚Äôm here.

I‚Äôm 31 and have, for most of my life, felt like there is something wrong with me. While I am rather intelligent, I am very disorganized, struggle to focus or accomplish anything, and have no friends. Since childhood, I have tried to get help but have instead been hurt time and time again. 

At the age of 23 I feared I was transgender (despite being assigned female and wanting nothing more than to be a woman) and ended up in therapy with a psychologist who focused on gender. She understood my terror as internalized transphobia and pushed away every reason I had for not wanting to medically transition. I told her I wasn‚Äôt masculine and that thinking about starting testosterone provided me with no relief whatsoever, but therapy essentially became about me having to accept the horrible fact that I could not be a woman and would not be able to keep the body I had been blessed with. I proceeded to spend 5 years on testosterone and get a double mastectomy. It was terrible. [What I was dealing with is called transgender OCD; I never had gender dysphoria. I am a woman.]

It was only 2 years ago that I began to uncover all my memories of therapy with that woman and things came crashing down hard. I‚Äòd had to convince myself that I was too fucked up to have children and that I could not be in a romantic relationship because nothing about the reality I was living in made sense. Over those years, I couldn‚Äôt understand why I wasn‚Äôt allowed to be a woman but had to just accept it. But now here I am, having lost so many years of my life, my body and voice forever altered.

I am still completely without motivation, friends, etc. I have done so little in life and cannot even afford an apartment of my own. I have a job, but I‚Äôm doing a bad work there and do not enjoy it. On some level I have accepted that I will never have my body back, but it makes me sick every day to remember I specifically went to therapy because I didn‚Äôt want to have to transition. That therapist‚Äôs treatment of me will never make any sense to me. And to make it all worse, everything that was wrong with me as a child is still wrong with me, but it‚Äôs all much worse now that I have this extra trauma that consumes me.

I don‚Äôt think I was supposed to be born. When I was younger, I told my mom she should have aborted me (terrible, I know, but it speaks to a long held feeling). 

I regularly hope that I will die in my sleep but am coming to accept that I may have to end it myself. I don‚Äôt know how (and don‚Äôt want my roommate to have to find me) but it seems like the most rational thing to do. All I have learned from mental health treatment is that no one believes there‚Äôs anything that can be done for me. So many mental health professionals have tried to reframe my story and/or minimize various aspects of my struggle. But what I know is this: It‚Äôs not sustainable to live without connection. It feels horrible to be this smart but to have no motivation and be completely unable to accomplish anything. It hurts my heart watching everyone around me have babies and love when I know that even if somehow I found a partner, it would be cruel for me to try to be a parent. If I‚Äôm this messed up, a child of mine could really only be worse.

Anyway, maybe I‚Äôll off myself soon... but I still hope I‚Äôll get lucky and die suddenly and without pain. That would be a beautiful ending."
320,and it never ends. i want to be ready to make it end. i just hurt for the couple of people i leave behind
321,I'm sorry but I want to fucking die
322,"I just wanna put this somewhere because I have no one to tell. It's been two years since I ever thought about suicide. I need to change my community. I don't like the word ""toxic"" but it is a very succinct descriptor. My family is toxic, lots of people are toxic, the things I choose to read online cause me frustration and negative emotions. I need to stop surrounding myself with these things.  I need to stop spending all my energy on things that I shouldn't expend so much time and energy on. I exercise and eat relatively well but I can see that my hobbies are breaking down. I want to go back to when I felt so motivated to better myself, my life, and my relationship."
323,"I‚Äôm 21 year old male, I‚Äôve struggled with depression for approximately 5/6 years. I went to the GP a couple of times but both times just prescribed me pills that made me feel empty and if anything worse. I have a very supportive and open group of friends, but I‚Äôve never truly opened up to them about how I feel, only dark jokes here n there and a couple of drunken spouts. I feel as if opening up to people that I see everyday just isn‚Äôt going to help, the few times I have brought the subject up I‚Äôve been extremely intoxicated but nothing anyone has ever said really helps, they‚Äôve of course told me they would always be there and what not, but this doesn‚Äôt really change anything. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I get the urge to talk to them, but it never really leads anywhere. I‚Äôve thought about killing myself a lot in these 6 years, but only recently have I had urges. There‚Äôs always been so many things holding me back, but none of them are for my sake. For instance my mother is an alcoholic and hasn‚Äôt told me but is clearly depressed as fuck, so if I killed myself I feel it would inevitably lead to her death as I‚Äôm her only child, she has no husband and a very small amount of friends/family she‚Äôs in contact with. This is just one reason among a plethora of others, almost all related to the effect my suicide with have on others. My GP doesn‚Äôt seem to want to send me to counselling, and I certainly can‚Äôt afford private counselling. Im now getting to the point where I‚Äôm almost afraid of killing myself, for the sake of my parents, but I‚Äôm just beginning to care less and less about the fallout of my suicide. I don‚Äôt know who to talk to and I live in the UK, what are your suggestions?"
324,"I thought it was my impulsive mood swings that would drive me to the brink of suicide one day but I'm realizing right now, it's more of a slow walk.

Suicidal thoughts used to come and go as I would give in to my emotions good and bad. Now it's just always there.

When I'm happy, I'm sad because I know this won't last and the thing that is waiting for me will come sooner rather than later. 

When I'm sad, I no longer feel the full extent of the emotion. I'm almost numb, the blows keep coming, I just don't care anymore. I know where I'm headed.

It's the anger that gets me. I'm angry at everything and because I'm angry at everything I see sides of myself I wish I never would. It reaffirms that I shouldn't be here. If there's one good thing I can do, it's remove myself from this planet."
325,"So, two days ago the one friend in this world I knew I could be completely honest with and would never judge me died They were the one person I could could confide in that I had an LDR with a huge age gap but that person meant/means everything to me.  

I was also able to talk to them about the rape I experienced just over 4 months ago which despite the 'impossibility' (age/menopause) resulted in pregnancy.  Due to a heart condition (amongst other things) I am not expected to survive the birth but I cannot change the situation or deny this child the right to his or her life.  So, I had my friend tell my LDL that I was already dead.  I thought that way I could at least support him.  Of course I wasn't expecting things to work out the way they did  

R/7th all I can do is apologise.  There are no excuses.  I understand if you never want to speak again but please don't blame J or G for this.  It was all my doing.  If it helps at all I am in considerable physical as well as mental pain.   I know I caused you extra pain but that was never my intention"
326,I'll be Taking my life soon by taking 16ish hydrocodone and washing it down with gin. I've hit such rock bottom that the level of apathy on how this will affect the people around me doesnt phase me anymore. It's almost relieving in a sense. My soul feels so exhausted. I could almost cry tears of joy knowing that its going to all be over soon.
327,"The most depressing time of each year. Really reminds me how alone I really am and how much I hate myself.

328,"for anything really. All the dark stuff I‚Äôve seen and gone through in the span of 6-7months. I was already struggling mentally, living with a mentally ill family member(who being around makes me more depressed), job complications, general dissatisfaction, and some romantic problems. 

I feel like what‚Äôs the point anymore. Now all of this happening all at once what‚Äôs the point of this all? What should I stay for? Last year was already extremely rough for me trying to finish my last year of school, while another family is dying, harassment everyday at school, trying to figure out my future, and just having problems with people.

332,What's the point? Someone tell me an answer I can believe for the rest of my life.
333,"Pushing down on me, pressing down on you"
334,"Hi everyone. This might be a long post because I need to get it all out. TLDR at bottom

So I went to the ER because I was having intense suicidal thoughts. After maybe 7 hours they let me out of the ER because they said that they thought they could ‚Äútrust me‚Äù and gave me the number for an outpatient program. 

I got an appointment for intake (had to wait 4 days because they didn‚Äôt have anything earlier), but they wouldn‚Äôt let me in because I had a temperature of 98.8. They told me I could reschedule for two weeks later. I told them that I was having serious mental health issues and I couldn‚Äôt wait that long. 

After I said that, a women pulled me to a private room and asked if I was planning to kill myself. She seemed angry (like she was really busy and didn‚Äôt have time to deal with this). 

I told her that‚Äôs why I was here: that yes, I do have a plan and a method to kill myself, but that I just want to try getting help one last time before I go through with it. She then actually started yelling at me. She told me that if I couldn‚Äôt tell her I wouldn‚Äôt kill myself they would have to ‚Äúthrow me in a random psych ward. I don‚Äôt know where or even which one.‚Äù 
I know you are probably thinking I‚Äôm exaggerating that. But that is actually what she said and I could not believe she would phrase it like that. She continued to describe how terrifying the experience of being hospitalized would be for me and that I wouldn‚Äôt be able to leave. But if I could just say that I wouldn‚Äôt hurt myself I could go home instead.

I stuck to my guns and told her that I am having intense and intrusive suicidal thoughts, and that I really don‚Äôt have a yes or no answer for if I would kill myself. I told her I might be able to promise I could be safe for the next few hours, but I can‚Äôt predict how I would feel later, especially if that‚Äôs for 2 weeks. She continued to pressure me and I told her I would call 911 if it got ‚Äúreally bad‚Äù. That seemed good enough for her and she made me sign a contract that basically said someone couldn‚Äôt sue them if I killed myself. And then they told me to leave.

Later that day I got a call that said that if I got a negative covid test I could come back for an intake appointment before the two weeks were up. And that they would fit me in the same day I got the test back. I got the test. No covid. Called to tell them that and they said I wouldn‚Äôt have to wait ANOTHER 4 days for intake, even though they promised they would have me in that day. I came back after that and had a temperature of 99.2, but they just shrugged it off. I finished the intake and they told me to start the program the next day.

So far I‚Äôve only been in their partial hospitalization program for 4 days and it‚Äôs awful. 

Every day, at the end of the day, they ask us if we are going to be safe. For the first 3 days I gave them my honest answer: I don‚Äôt know. They would then have a nurse pull me into another room and do a whole routine similar to the one I mentioned earlier. They would describe how scary the hospitalization would be. They would tell me I would have to share a room with people that have mental health issues, that they would be too loud and scary for me to sleep. They basically said anything to scare me away from saying I need to be there. And I would always just tell them I would call 911 if things got worse, and they‚Äôd let me go. 

I think they shouldn‚Äôt be approaching it like this. If they make it their mission to scare people out of hospitalization, some day someone is going to go home without the help they really need and kill themselves. It‚Äôs probably already happened. 

Since my very first day, I‚Äôve also felt harassed by a male patient who have been following me, asking me out, blocking the entrance/exit so I have to talk to him, etc. I complained to the staff that it makes it hard for me to feel safe there and they said that my only option was to put up with it or leave. Not the man. Me. 

I spoke to another girl in the program about this and she said he was doing the same thing to her. I later found out this was happening to every young skinny white girl that entered the program. Someone told me it‚Äôs happened to like 8 women. They have all complained about it but the management won‚Äôt do anything. He even tried to get in her car with one of these girls. It is also on our entrance contract that you can‚Äôt ask for other patient‚Äôs numbers and he‚Äôs done that several times. I feel like under those grounds they should be able to ask him to leave or at least behave himself but they didn‚Äôt do anything.

As for my therapy group itself, I don‚Äôt know if what we are doing is therapy. I‚Äôve tried to talk about some of the issues that brought me there but our group leader just doesn‚Äôt seem interested, talks over me, and changes the topic. In the past 4 days we‚Äôve spent 12 hours talking about his favorite movies, child actors that grow up and go on coke binges, and when he thinks is the appropriate time to use the n-word. I‚Äôm not joking. He spent an hour talking about just the n-word.

The program is just giving people 9 days in php before downgrading them to the 3-days-a-week 3-hours-a-day program. So far I haven‚Äôt been able to discuss anything that brought me there and I‚Äôm already half way through my stay. Yesterday I had a panic attack about that because I realized at this rate I would be discharged without even beginning to get help. If the next 5 days were anything like the first 4, I wouldn‚Äôt have received any therapy or learned any useful skills.

I went to the front desk and asked if I could speak to someone about rearranging my care plan. They asked me who I wanted to talk to and I told them whoever is in charge. Instead, they just got a random nurse.

The nurse did the whole suicide routine with me again and then handed me off to my psychiatrist. Before I could even say why I felt like I wasn‚Äôt getting any therapy, he told me I needed to just listen to him and that I wouldn‚Äôt like what he had to say.

He asked me if diabetes is curable. I said, ‚Äúno, but it‚Äôs managed.‚Äù He asked me if AIDS is curable. ‚ÄúNo but it‚Äôs managed‚Äù

He then said ‚Äúwell then why do you expect us to cure your depression? Because we can‚Äôt.‚Äù

At this point, no one had even asked me why I was unhappy with my care. No one asked me anything. I wanted to tell him that I didn‚Äôt expect my depression to be cured, but that I do expect at least some help to even start to manage it before I leave, but he called a nurse in to take me away before I could say anything to him.

The nurse took me to another room. I told her that I feel like I‚Äôm not getting any help here. She asked if I didn‚Äôt like my group therapist. I told her yes and started to tell her that I don‚Äôt feel listened to and she cut me off (ironic). She told me that I can‚Äôt say that ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm getting any help‚Äù and that I have to say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm relating to (insert therapist name here)‚Äù. 

Which isn‚Äôt how I feel. I feel like I‚Äôm not getting any help, like I said. And I feel like I‚Äôm not being listened to, and your not listening to me.

She said ‚Äúwhat do you want? A female therapist?‚Äù

I told her ‚ÄúI guess?‚Äù because I do want a new therapist. Period. But him being a guy wasn‚Äôt the issue. Nobody had heard or wanted to hear the issue. 

I guess she just needed to check a box on a form because I was switching therapists. And if the reasons was something like the gender it would be less work because she wouldn‚Äôt have to listen to me and write it down. And that way the therapist wouldn‚Äôt get in trouble for talking about the n-word and how he thought Jodie Foster was hot in Taxi Driver for 4 days instead of doing therapy.  Gender was not the issue. The not doing any therapy part was the issue but I was so steamrolled over that nobody got to hear that.

The nurse than told me she couldn‚Äôt find anyone available and sent me to lunch, where I just sat in the parking lot for an hour feeling even more hopeless about this program than ever. When I came back the nurse said she could squeeze me into another group next week. Which I guess is good, but at this point I have lost so much faith in the rest of the program that I don‚Äôt know if I want to come back. 

At the end of the day, the group leader I‚Äôm supposed to have next week was the one who had to ask again if we would be safe. I was so emotionally exhausted that I thought if I opened my mouth I would cry. When she got to me she asked me if I wanted to pass and I nodded. She said I still needed to answer if I would be safe. I didn‚Äôt have it in me to speak so I just nodded again. She said I had to verbally say I would be safe (I guess for legal reasons). I said it and immediately burst into tears like I knew I would, in front of everyone.

I thought she might ask me if something was wrong and if I was actually safe after she let the group out. Because if you ask someone if they are going to hurt themselves and they burst into tears and can hardly choke out a few words saying they‚Äôll be ok maybe you should talk with them. But no. She just let me go anyways.

I am so hopeless about going back. My first week got me absolutely nowhere. The only thing that has changed is that I feel like no one at this hospital has any concern for my safety of any desire to hear how I feel.

I want to quit the program because I am just being made to feel uncomfortable and unimportant. I haven‚Äôt gotten any therapy while there but I‚Äôm also scared about what I would do if I‚Äôm not in a program at all.

336,"I can't get better living with my family. I'm too depressed to get another job on top of the one I have. I don't function. I daydream the whole day and sh to cope. I'm tired of being alive. I've been on almost every medication available for my mental illnesses and not a single one has worked long term. I'm tired of the hallucinations and the bad thoughts. Every second I'm awake I want to hurt myself. Even in my dreams I'm hurting myself and trying to die. Im too depressed to cope and I've tried to reach out for help , even with professionals, but they never pay attention. I'll try to talk to my counselor about it on Tuesday and see if I can get admitted to the local mental hospital to be assessed to see if I'm eligible to be put in the state mental hospital. If this doesn't work out my only option is to continue trying to kms until it works. Or I might kill myself tonight or during the weekend."

I waant to be happy, and want ro the person everyone deserves but I cant. I'm kidding myself by thinking I can be. I just want the pain to stop, I just want to stop feeling the way I do. I hate this. I'm sick of the voices in my head, telling me to end it, I just want it all to stop. It pains me to write this but reliving at the same time. My feelings are not just trapped in my own head all the time. But I want to leave and make sure no blames themselves, this is something that I alone have decided. It's the pain has become too much to shrug off and ignore anymore. I know this isnt the place for this sort of thing and I'm sorry I just...I dont know what to do I have no one to talk to, and no where to go. I'm just so sorry for everything"

Today I talked to a friend (earlier i was originally just having a walk to a place that made me feel a bit weird and I thought that maybe I could try and talk to someone for once to see if it could help distract me from my bad thoughts) I haven't talked to in a little while, I thought that maybe I'd feel a bit better after feeling a bit bad for a while. But when we hung up I just thought of how awkward and uncomfortable I actually was, if felt like I couldn't hold the conversation properly, this is he first time in just a few month I had talked to a supposedly close friend of mine and I just felt worse. I'm also not doing well regarding my grades, I'm failing, and now I'm trying to feel in an emptiness I have been feeling because I realised how lonely and kind of pathetic I became. I might regret posting this and delete it later or might not, I dont know. I just would like to have someone to talk to for a bit because I can't sort out any of my emotions right now. I'm sorry if this post is hard to understand. Maybe I could explain it better in a conversation. I don't know."
340,"He knows about suicide hotlines and he even had a psychiatrist once.

I‚Äòm not his best friend we talk like 3 times a day but he said that I‚Äôm really important to him once.

2 days ago was the last day of school where I live and we had a really long talk. We are ‚Äûbus buddies‚Äú but no bus drove this late on that day, we were on a party that day. 

He confessed that he has been cutting himself and 1 day earlier was about to jump in front of a truck that was driving by. He said that if he lost his best friends he wouldn‚Äôt have any reason to live. I don‚Äôt know if I can help him but maybe there is something. His best friends also know that he‚Äòs suicidal.

I'm really struggling and have already decided on what i'm going to do, so please don't go down that road. What I need help with is this. Should I write letters for my children to read when they are old enough?

I doubt they would ever get them, their mother would probably destroy them if it were her responsibility and tell the kids lies. I doubt giving them t my side of the family will help much either, pretty sure she will drop contact the moment i'm gone.

I‚Äôm using an alternate account to ask this in case the other person is following my main and might see this. 

Over the last couple of months a younger kid, I think he‚Äôs 14? Has been messaging me here and there. He‚Äôs said some questionable things in the course of this, but nothing I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs serious about. It seems more for shock value. Tbh, I‚Äôd prefer not to speak to him, but he occasionally mentions suicide and we chat back and forth until he seems to come up with alternate ideas about maybe speaking to his doctor to request a med change, or reaching out to someone at school... anyway, today he told me he has a plan. I‚Äôm not even sure what country he lives in, but I wish there was a way to find his parents. In lieu of that, is there any sort of reporting system in reddit?

Edit to add: I‚Äôm reposting this because it got removed from no stupid questions, I didn‚Äôt know this sub existed. I looked at the kids profile, he‚Äôs actually a little younger than I thought, but all his posts are suicide related for the most part. But he told me he has a plan and plans to do it on Wednesday. So really is there anything else to be done?"
351," Since 2018 my dad and my mom have been fighting over him marrying another woman behind his back and this has caused a severe ripple in our family. They've been fighting back and fourth and my dad refused to do anything about the relationship between him, my mom, and the other woman. They've been on and off again with fights and arguments but things didn't really get bad until this year. After my dad revealed he was going to pay for another apartment for my mom to live in so he could separate himself and his family away from my mother, she flew into a frenzy throwing slurs at him until he ended up pushing my mother and yelling at me and my two sisters that if she says anything to divide us he will leave us and never come back. This all happened at the time of me making this post and idk what to do. I've also noticed my sisters growing an increased resentment for my father and slowly but surely giving him a lot more flak for his behavior, but he swears and even sometimes threatens them with violence to make sure they don't go against him. I'm worried what this will do to there pyche in the future cuz my littlest sister is only 10. I haven't spoken to anyone at all about this and I don't want to give the names of me or my parents, I just want to see if there is anyone who knows what I should do."

People go on their way, just forgetting the people they met and enjoyed talking with. I'm one of those people unfortunately. I wish I could remember people more, how they were and what they did, instead I can only remember other useless trivial shit.

Only now do I feel somewhat wanted by everyone around me.

They say we're going to be movie stars, hall of famers, all of those things... We're all going to be a success...

It fucked with me so much I was driving home and saw a truck in the other lane and wanted to drift over and hit them head on the only reason I didn't was because my mother and sister were also in the car. All this happened at 11:00 this morning. Its 12:22 now I really don't think I'll get through the rest of the day. I was in the shower for a half hour crying and at one point I was screaming so loud no sound was coming out of my mouth.

363,"Every time I try to talk to someone about this all they can ever say is that I'm choosing to be like this. The thing is, they're right. I hate myself, really badly. Every time I walk past the mirror I feel the urge to swing at myself and half the time I dont even try to fight it. All I ever do is sit around and wallow in self pity and all it does recognizing that fact is make me even more aware of how terrible I am. My anxiety controls my life completely and I dont even have the energy to resist it anymore. I want out of this, desperately. I'd take suicide in a heartbeat but I'm too scared of the pain to even do that. I'm not even afraid of dying anymore, it just seems peaceful. I just cant work up the nerve to make myself do it. I'm so god damn tired of being alone and i cant even come close to finding someone like this and if i did all I'd do is make their life worse. By all means this should just be a choice. Just go to therapy, right? Stick to your job, work out, find a good schedule, work yourself out of it? I've done it in the past, people way worse off do it all the time. But I dont think I even want to anymore. Every time I pull myself out, no matter how hard I try, no matter what I do, I get drug back down again sooner or later and it's always my fault. I dont have the willpower to spend my whole life fighting this. I dont deserve to live, I'm pathetic, and weak, and selfish, and a terrible person. This post is just more proof, all im doing is pretending to reach out so I can shut down every Suggestion anyone has and use it to feel even worse for myself and try to garner some scrap of pity from well meaning people I've never met and who cant do a damned thing to help me. Cause it's all on me, it always has been and it always will be. It's entirely my choice to be this way, and I continue to get worse and worse and worse every day. I've always been a fairly militant athiest, but I find myself wanting to pray lately, beg some god or force in the universe to look down on me with pity and just snuff me out. I dont know why I'm even taking the time and effort to write this post."

365,"My wife and I just got married. She came from the Philippines for the sole purpose of marrying me.

Got married in January. Been questioning a lot since then. Including my will to live.

We have been fighting more and more. She expresses how badly she wish she could go back to the Philippines. 

I want her to go. I don't want her to be bogged down here because of me. And divorce is unheard of in her family. 

She doesn't want to leave me though. 

So as a just in case basis I wrote down my suicide note on my phone. Should I need to then I will do a quick copy-paste and then blast my noggin off. Thats the plan as of this moment. 

I know I can't go on like this for much longer.... we have the works going just in case we can save everything, counseling, etc. But just in case, if worse comes to worse, I'm ready now to leave on a moments notice.

Even thinking of doing it now. I thought as she hugged me before she took a nap, if this is the last hug she ever got from me..."
366,"Here I am back where I desperately try so hard to stay away from. I‚Äôve had depression my whole life I think but since I‚Äôve reached my early 20s it‚Äôs gotten completely out of hand. Constant fear , anxiety , depression, intrusive thoughts, ptsd . I‚Äôm exhausted and tired of hating myself. 

Here is what is going on with me right now. I date this girl who i became friends with in college . We dated for about a year and it ended when she sent nudes of herself to another man. She told me one evening when I was over her place laying in bed . I ended it the next day. I was pretty hurt by what she did , especially because she was the last person I would suspect to ever betray me like that. For about a month after the break up she kept trying to get me back . Trying to figure out ways to work on it. But I kept insisting that the trust was broken. I can forgive her and move on from what she did but I can‚Äôt trust her anymore . She wouldn‚Äôt take no for an answer.

Another month passes and she stops hitting me up. It got to the point where I had to completely block her on everything but she figured out a way to make a temporary number to reach out to me. After another month passes she starts hitting me up again only singing a different tune basically saying I‚Äôm a piece of shit I did nothing for her in the relationship and how I can‚Äôt forgive her for this one mistake but she can forgive me for a million. She would still try calling me at night and would randomly send me angry texts yelling at me for something she didn‚Äôt like that I did . Basically every time she tried texting me it was to remind me that I‚Äôm a coward who was bad in bed never did shit for her and had no motivation to do anything with my life.

During the relationship I struggled with depression . I was afraid to go to therapy and I hated myself and had extremely low self esteem . I had erectile dysfunction so sex gave me anxiety. My girlfriend had a very high sex drive and she always wanted to have sex and complained and made me feel bad for not wanting to enough and thought I wasn‚Äôt attracted to her . She made me feel like a loser and even yelled at me once and suggested an open relationship because I lost my erection during sex. 

She has bi-polar disorder and she would snap on me for any little thing I did. If I wasn‚Äôt getting something done quick enough, if I dropped a bag of chips going to a party. If I canceled plans. She would literally snap on me and constantly threaten to dump me. It wasn‚Äôt her fault though because she had that disorder but I couldn‚Äôt take the constant what I felt was bullying and when she would start an argument sometimes I would freak out and yell back because I didn‚Äôt know how to handle it. 

These fights would sometimes escalate into really bad screaming matches and we would both say really mean things to each other. But I swear from the bottom of my heart she would start about 95% of them because nothing I did was ever good enough for her everything was a problem to her. She picked on me and it was embarrassing. 

But we loved each other. She did a lot of things for me when she wasn‚Äôt being a jerk. She drove everywhere , tried helping me find a job when I was looking to quit my old one. Would babysit my neice ... and was a shoulder to cry on when I was going through serious problems with my depression. However that kindness could all change in an instant when she would lose it on me out of no where and I couldn‚Äôt deal with it.

Now she goes on twitter and says how I am a piece of shot for not giving her a chance , after all she did for me yet I was there for her so much during her trials and tribulations gave her so much love and affection. She tells me I‚Äôm a loser with no motivation never drove couldn‚Äôt fuck and didn‚Äôt deserve her even though I helped her so much during a really difficult time in her life and she would tell me constantly I deserve better and that she may have ended her life if it weren‚Äôt for me and some  of her friends .

Now I just can‚Äôt deal anymore with her bitching at me telling me I‚Äôm a loser. My sexual problems my constant hatred of myself . I‚Äôll never be ok, I‚Äôll never find the right woman and I don‚Äôt deserve too maybe I am a loser seriously. It‚Äôs probly time. I‚Äôm sure she bashed my name and reputation to her friends telling them I‚Äôm a fuckin loser . 

It‚Äôs time to go out . Life is TOO MUCH TO BARE IM SORRY MOM GOD AND EVERYONE"

I‚Äôve done this before but back then I was only getting a months supply at a time and I ended up sending out messages to my family and wound up in the er. This time however I just drank until I fell asleep. I did this on impulse, I wasn‚Äôt planning it up until like 1 or 2 hours before I did it. 

Well I woke up around 6 am shaking in a cold sweat. I could hardly walk but I made it to the bathroom to puke my guts out. It was a rough day but I managed to call in sick work (which I never do) and convince my wife that it was just alcohol withdrawal.
Anyway I looked up the half-life and it‚Äôs 12 hours. It‚Äôs been close to 48 hours and I‚Äôm still here. I don‚Äôt feel suicidal anymore but I don‚Äôt want this to happen again because it‚Äôll just keep escalating until it works. Seeing a therapist has never helped me.

374,"# Let me tell you about my family a little before we get started

My great-grandfather was very rich that my family literally owned a small town in Izmir until they sold most of it because they are spending way too much money for their own \*entertainment\*.

My aunt is married to a millionaire (maybe billionaire? idk his net worth) business man who owns an international construction company along with many other smaller companies in different industries, his company primarily works for middle-eastern governments including Turkey's.

That same aunt apparently (I was told by my father) has connections to *extraordinarily* important and rich government officials also. (won't get into details for obvious reasons)

My family also has connections to politicians from both major parties in this country, one of which helped me get appointment from one of the best doctors for my OCD treatment (of course we couldn't afford it after like 3 sessions and I'm currently not getting medical help) after months of seeing a doctor who clearly does not know what he is doing.

All my cousins are well-educated and living in first-world countries such as Canada, United States and some EU countries.

# About me

I'm a 20 years old male from a very poor part of Turkey, a shitty middle-east country.

I grew up poor, didn't get any proper education (public schools in this country is, well, you get the picture) and learned everything I know by myself without any help.

I currently live with my mom and dad at a poor and dangerous neighborhood (people would literally stab you for looking at their eyes here!), needless to say we have no money and I'm living in pretty bad conditions.

For the last 6 years I have only had one single goal in my life: moving to a good country with my mom, preferably Canada. I'm rapidly losing my hopes of moving as our financial situation only gets worse and worse.

No one in my family cares about me, no one ever did. They almost deny my existence as they wouldn't even recognize me if I was standing right next to them in a bus stop. I was always a disappointment to them ever since I was born, all because my grandmother didn't want my father to marry my mom.

I never had any friends except one from middle school (whom I lost contact with 8 years ago). I never lived my childhood and teenage years and I'm likely to sit my 20s in this old, cheap chair looking at this computer screen. In the last 7 years of my live I learned programming and I made various different websites/apps/games with hopes I'd earn enough money to actually be able to live. No, all I got sums to around $5K. I can't even use my programming skills for my own projects anymore as I will no longer be able to afford paying for server costs due to Turkish Lira rapidly losing value against the United States Dollar and our only income is in TL.

I don't believe in any god or a supernatural entity, death is like time travel to me, I believe that once I'm dead trillions of years might pass and to me it wouldn't be anything. I would stay as nothing until whatever is me becomes something conscious again.

I have planned to end my life in many ways over the last decade, countless times. I planned every single detail very carefully to make sure nothing goes wrong. I even planned to leave a video note behind me for those who left me to rot in this shithole like they would even bother watching it.

All these scenarios and I can't possibly think of one single future where I survive after my mom and dog dies. I would kill myself without even thinking twice.

TL;DR: My family is basically among the super-elite of Turkey, they did everything they could to make my life worse and worse despite having the power to help me, all because my grandmother didn't like my mother."

Im sick of everyone waiting for me to fuck up, and yet time after time after time i do.i have noone, my family is scattered across the country and my friends pfft they wont understand. my parents i expect will just shrug it off within a mouth, i tried once to kill myself and failed, this time im going big or going home. theres no point being somewhere were ypur not wanted and in this case its living, the only thing is im too much of a coward right now. i want to do. i need to. yet i cant when it comes to it. i just need someone to talk to but everyones too busy.

377,"I'm 22, i left school when i was 15 and from that point i've been on a downward spiral with multiple depressed phases. Lots of suicidal thoughts, my mind is so clouded i can barely think anymore and im so fucking tired all the time. 

For years i've spent the majority of my time either working out and trying to get better or lying down in bed every day watching pointless shit sinking endless hours into watching braindead content on youtube/twitch/reddit or gaming or masturbaiting

I'm embarrassed to be alive, i hate that my family have to even talk to me... I've become fucking ugly, i have body dysmorphia and ADD. I have pushed all my family and friends away who try to help i'd rather just stay like this... A retarded recluse who feels so disgusting that i can barely look at myself.

The embarrassment and emotional pain i feel on a daily basis is completely fucked, i have nothing left. I socially isolate so nobody can talk to me, i ignore all the calls i get, i start waking up at night instead of day so i don't have to see my family. Im so tired i can barely stand for long periods of time, i'm fucking 22 and a 6'2 male who was in pretty good shape 6 months ago.... What the fuck i can't even believe how stupid i am. And these cycles have been going on for fucking yeaaars man, i've never felt fucking comfortable in my own skin i swear.

My posture has gone to shit, my general hygiene has gone to shit, i don't care about my health even though i'm obsessed with how i look, i don't try to change it. I feel unattractive but deep down all i've ever wanted is someone to hold

I enjoy sleeping rather than being awake, running from my problems, being inconsistent with every facet of life, always taking myself for granted

Im so confused because i'm a spiritual person yet so vain and insecure, it's tearing me apart i don't understand and i'm detaching myself from ""reality"" or whatever the fuck that is.

I'm planning on getting drunk and hanging myself tomorrow, putting a rope around my neck and kicking the ladder. Tying a perfect noose and having a solid anchor point, im scared but its the only thing that comforts me.

Going to play some music, buy some cigarettes and drink

My mother loves me so much but she cant see this, i cant tell her

I understand that even posting this is seen as an outcry for help, but i'm not doing this for me. I just want to leave some sort of miniscule mark for someone to perceive which sounds dumb. But this has been my life... Me holding a fucking phone in my hands lying down in bed (like usual).

378,"First off I'm going to start by saying, I took a drug. So  that probs pays a huge part of how I'm feeling rn, but I just feel so empty all the time, I can't escape it.

I don't want to die, I need to die."
379,"Everyday I lie in bed with nothing but evil thoughts. I constantly remind myself for hours on end that I‚Äôm unattractive and that no one will ever care for me as much as I care for them. I hate it. I never feel like I‚Äôm good enough for anyone. 

I feel like the only time that I can escape these thoughts is when I‚Äôm with friends. But as soon as everyone is gone its back to feeling like shit again. 

Sometimes people will joke about my appearance or humor. As friends I know that they love me and never mean these jokes in a negative light but they really do hurt deep down. And its only because of how lowly I think of myself. 

I want to just disappear."

385,"Hey

I'm so fucking terrified man. Not of death at all. I mean fuck that's the only escape we've got. That little back pocket portal out of existence. The fear everyday comes from failure in the future coming from failure now. In HS I really didn't give a shit about grades so I just kindov worked my ass off in minimum wage the second I turned 15 (I'm 19 now). I guess I got so used to the mindlessness of it that once I graduated I had nothing to show for. I've been In CC since and I've been doing ""ok"" in my GE classes. My major jumped back and forth so nothing hasn't really been focused. First Screenwriting, then fear of failure scared the shit out of me - So I tried to set up classes to be a doctor, then the fear of failure scared the shit out of me - So now I've been goin for Comp Sci, and holy shit is the fear creeping. I mean you know - you look up a degree someone got and they give their war story of how they wish they never even tried. Yah that's not everyone, but with the string of bad luck and bad choices a guy can make, who says that'll just magically stop. And for the grades, fucking christ, you get a C you feel like you're some fuckin degenerate compared to these trust fund mother fuckers. I'm not as suicidal as I have been in HS, mostly due to my Heroin addict brother who tried to kill me a few times and then my mom gaslighted me, finally getting kicked out for the last time. But man can I feel it wrapping back around me almost like a comforting blanket. Death means I can just stop. Just Stop thinking, just stop worrying, just stop being so god damn worthless. If classes don't work out then its either suicide or Navy for me. I just can't live my life under someone else's fuckin boot anymore (I get the irony with Navy but hey I might feel like I'm doing something worthwhile for once). Oh yah I'm broke as shit, but arn't we all at this point.

No one cares until it‚Äôs too late."
398,"‚ÄúI‚Äôm a junkie, 23 years old with no friend, no job, no car, living alone in a foreign country with my grandma‚Äôs money.‚Äù

When I was born, my mom passed aways and my dad left me with my aunt and grandma. Grandma did a fine job taking care of me. However, my aunt would always hurt me, if not with her hands then her words. One time she locked me in the closet for days with out food or water, yelling ‚Äúeven your dad doesn‚Äôt want you, you shouldn‚Äôt be born.‚Äù It hurts so much but I get used to it.

As expected, growing up in abusive household took a toll on me. I became a troubled student as soon as I joined middle school. It started with little thing like fighting, smoking cigarettes, stealing other student‚Äôs stuff, one time I punched a teacher.

They had enough of me, my grandma and my aunt couldn‚Äôt handle me anymore so they sent me back to live with my dad. Btw, my dad started a new family so now I have step mom and step sister. 

After moving to new city, new school, new family, I felt lost. They all made me felt like I don‚Äôt belong in that family, that I‚Äôll aways be a mistake, that I don‚Äôt belong anywhere. I had no one to talk to, no one to ask for help, so I hid my problems, buried it deep down so it doesn‚Äôt hurt. 

I wanted to be recognized by my dad so I did everything to make him proud. I wasn‚Äôt bad at high school, as I always landed in top 5 of my grade. But that wasn‚Äôt enough. He never said he loves me or proud of me, hell he never act like it to. 

I started playing instruments, guitar, and piano. I joined the competitive martial art group and even got to the semi final match of my city. I ran for a school presidency, I got scholarship for top 4 university in Thailand, doing all that hoping to that he‚Äôd finally approve me as his son. Nope, ain‚Äôt got time for non of that. 

Ok I get it, I was a mistake. It doesn‚Äôt matter how hard I tried, he‚Äôll never be proud of me, so I gave up.

This happens when I was 18. I tried to kill myself.

My roommate came back and see me on the floor, throwing up, shaking, stuffs coming out of my mouth. I‚Äôd been hospitalized and diagnosed with clinical depression, panic attack, bipolar so they prescribed me bars and some other antidepressants. I stayed in hospital alone for days, hoping someone in my family would at least call or come to visit me, none. 

This finally hits me that I‚Äôm and I‚Äôll always be a mistake. So I ran aways, I came to the United States as college student. 

After a few months, instead of study hard working for better future, I started taking more prescribed pills, smoking weed, doing stuffs I‚Äôd never imaged before. Gambling aways my time and money. It felt good I‚Äôll tell you that, there‚Äôs not a thing in world you have to care when you get that dopamine ride. 

But what come up must goes down. After 2 years alone in US I tried to end it all again but I‚Äôm a coward and I couldn‚Äôt do it. I just couldn‚Äôt jump. I called suicide prevention line and they took me in for a few days.

After I was discharged I went back to be an addict full time. Gambling, smoking dope, popping pills.

Days turn to months, months turn to years and I stuck in the same loop. Waking up, get high, go to sleep. Repeat it over and over again. I don‚Äôt eat anymore because if I buy food then I don‚Äôt have money to pay for rent. 

It been 5 years now since I left the place I called ‚Äòhome‚Äô and I‚Äôm still the same person when I left, a loner, a failure, a mistake, plus hella addictions. 

I want it all to end. I feel shameful and guilt every time I look in a mirror, I hate seeing myself.

Everyone said get a job and life will be better... but who‚Äôd want a broken person like me? I can‚Äôt even work legally here.

I‚Äôve been sober for 4 months now. Everyday is a living hell for me. I have no purpose, no more self esteem.

I‚Äôm 23 and I‚Äôve tried to kill myself twice.
I just hope next time will be the last. 

(English is not my first language, I apologize for a mistake.)"
399,Yet too bad I won't even enjoy it.
400,"I've already written this here about a week ago in the comments of my other post, but I want to write it again.

Sometimes when I write about my family situation, I word it in a way that makes other people think that I live with an abussive mother. And this makes me feel very bad, because this is just not true. My mom actually has kicked my abussive step-dad from our house 6 years ago, which helped me a lot. And she have spent a lot of time and money trying to provide me a proper education and professional mental help. But this just didn't worked.

I've attempted to study in the university 3 times, but every time I failed in the first half-year because of my mental health getting worse and worse. Medical treatment had no positive effect at all. And I had very negative experience with so many therapists, I just don't trust any of them anymore.

My mom is not abussive - I'm actually the one who is abusing her. I often loudly yell at her for stupid reasons, because my sick brain precepts a lot of harmless things as an acts of hostility, and making me act very defensive. And even thought I always apologize to her about an hour after, this really poisons my mom's life (because, obviously, just  saying sorry and hugging will to heal the damage that have already been done).

She often tells me that one day I will drive her to stroke, and that she really wants to finally escape from me, and live with her BF in another county (and she already  has a serious plans to do this, but Coronavirus messed everything up). And this is really understandable - I yell at her very loud and often  also prefer all sorts of mental gymnastics to accuse her at even more insane things. And this hurts her so much, that she tells me that if I will continue she will call an ambulance that will drove me to a mental asylum (even though this is abviously not true - she loves me, and will never do that to me).

Don't think that she wants to leave me starving though (like I paranoidly say to her  sometimes) - she says that she will still financially support me, even from another country. But she really wants me to be able to live alone, without her constant help. I say to her that I can't work, but I think it's a lie (more to myself, that to her). Like she says, I still have my hands and legs, and don't have anything serious (like schizophrenia), so I can have at least a basic job to sustain my life - I'm just too lazy to do so, while other people with my exact issues can live alone fine.

Basically, I'm leeching on my mom. And the fact that with all of this I'm also (most likely intentionaly) wording my posts they way that make **her** look like and abuser, really makes me hate myself."
401,"No one truly cares about you until you're gone... This has been a universal truth since the beginning of man. No one wants to acknowledge your mental illness or need for support even though you're clearly signaling for help, instead most will ridicule you and treat your call for help as a cry for attention because they lack the empathy and intelligence to understand and perceive the world as through your perspective.

Once it's too late some will show their condolences and craft fake statements in an attempt to convince themselves that they really cared about you, all to validate themselves as ""good people"". These people never once had you cross their mind during their days until you passed, but as soon as you die you all of a sudden meant so much to them, and that you were such a huge inspiration to them.

Im afraid that Ill always feel this way, that it never gets better, because truth be told, my life couldnt be much better. I have great friends and family, a job I love that pays well, my own awesome flat, a therapist, hobbies and interests, I got it all...

Im afraid one day I dont have the strength to carry on anymore. That one day I lose my battle, because I can win everyday and have to fight the next, but if I lose once, its over.

404,"Hi, sorry I don‚Äôt really know how to start.

In September of 2017, I was called into school to discuss with a counsellor why my attendance had been worsening, my mother had to come with me too. We arrived at the school, went through the office and into a room with a counsellor.

We sat down, and he was asking me and my
Mother questions, I don‚Äôt remember what they were but seeing as the meeting was being held to discuss attendance, I‚Äôm sure you can imagine what he wanted to talk about. All I really remember about the meeting is when he asked, ‚Äúare you willing to go into school now?‚Äù, because this was at about 10am on a school day. I replied with ‚Äúno, could I start fresh tomorrow?‚Äù. He said ‚Äúok, make sure you turn up though.‚Äù But in that moment I was completely aware that that was it for me.

In that moment, when I said no. That was it, I didn‚Äôt come in the next day, or the day after, I never went in again. Having being told all my life by my teachers that I had great potential, coming to realise that I had completely failed academically, because of my stupid fucking mental health. It haunts me everyday that moment.

Since then, I‚Äôve bounced around various mental health services who have tried to help me, all of which require me to leave my home. Which I can‚Äôt do anymore. I‚Äôm petrified of strangers, god forbid one laughs within a one mile radius of me, I‚Äôll think that they‚Äôre laughing at me cause I look like a disgusting goblin.

As I said all the help I was offered was dependant on me leaving my home, which I was unable to do, and I still am unable to do. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I can‚Äôt leave my home, my mind is foggy, I‚Äôm forgetting how to feel anything other than despair. I watch everyone I went to school with surpass me in every way imaginable. I‚Äôm stuck. I don‚Äôt want to live. I have no one to talk too, my mother is too old fashioned to understand what I feel. 

Everyday I wake up, go to my computer and sit at it everyday. I‚Äôm a leech, completely fucking useless, a complete and utter burden on everyone, even on my self. Why the fuck did I have to be born, why couldn‚Äôt someone more appreciative be born in my place. 

These are my current diagnoses, figured they should be included.

.Social Anxiety Disorder
.Major Depressive Disorder
.Borderline Personality Disorder

If you wasted your time reading my ramblings I‚Äôm sorry, I just, wanted to get something out there, maybe someone would read it and understand. Surely, just one."
405,"I only had about 10 anxiety and depression meds on hand so I knew that wouldn't do it. So I stared to frantically searching for my belt to hang myself with but couldn't find it, so I guess I just passed out cause I was tired. I then wake up today to find out I was wearing it the whole time and I feel the such a fucking idiot, more then I already did. I guess this is what rock bottom feels like. I guess it's kinda the classic trop to say this, but I can't even kill myself right. I'm such a fucking waste."

I think everyone here is afraid of their future, including me. My hope in life isn't entirely gone. I don't love what I've written, but maybe someone here might appreciate it."
407,Am I just punishing myself for still being alive
408,"I feel like every decision I take is the wrong decision. I feel like my world has been crumbling around me slowly and I‚Äôm just tired of worrying and stressing. My family is in the lower class and we‚Äôve always struggled. I slept on the floor until I got my first bed when I was 10. I know people have been worse but that‚Äôs just kinda putting it into a perspective. I can‚Äôt help but feel like even when I‚Äôve got it good, right around the corner is something waiting to ruin my happiness. Right now I‚Äôm in the middle though, I just got a new job so I‚Äôm finally able to feel like I‚Äôm worth something but I just keep worrying about the worst like I‚Äôm going to get fired or something. The other day while I was working someone really sketchy walked in and for a second I was actually scared. Then just 5 seconds later my brain took a tole to who cares if I die. If I get shot and die it‚Äôs whatever. Just a very passive suicide kind of mindset. I don‚Äôt want to get into the problems of my life but today has been a terrible day and today just seems like a good day to say fuck it. I guess in the end I just feel like I‚Äôm walking on thin ice and like at any moment I‚Äôll be some bum on the streets all alone. I feel like I have no backup and like if I ever fell no one would be there to back me up. I kinda feel alone. I‚Äôm not alone, but I feel alone. Life is a series of random events, but I feel like the bad out weighs the good. I‚Äôm just tired of stressing out and worrying. The sad part is I‚Äôm only 18 so I know there‚Äôs plenty more of that coming my way. I just feel trapped and doomed to fail. 

Sorry for this depressing lump of text and to anyone who reads it."
409,"I'm very suicidal person and I thought I will start a new life.. New country.. New ppl.. Etc... Where can I start
I hate my current life its disgusting"
410,"I‚Äôm broke jobless with shitty education background 

But when I imagine myself rich and successful that doesn‚Äôt really make me happy either 

Thus, I think that death is the only thing I want.
Although I am young I feel so sad and unhappy so I couldn‚Äôt even imagine how I would handle life when I get old or get very sick. I prefer to not experience that.


I just don‚Äôt want life . It‚Äôs tiring and what‚Äôs for ? To die I‚Äôm the end so why not die now?


How can I die in the comfort of my home? I don‚Äôt wanna go out I wanna die now in my bed why does it have to be this hard to die ?"
411,"I keep trying to get my life together, to make some kind of progress... and I think I‚Äôm there, I think I‚Äôve started to move forward, only to be reminded of my place. Of how everyone actually sees me, as a weight to be tolerated and carried and resented. Well, I‚Äôm tired of my place, and I want more. All or nothing, either will satisfy me... but to think you‚Äôve come so far only to hit the same wall again, full circle, I feel more lost today than usual. It‚Äôs just impossible to be who I‚Äôm wanted to be, and I‚Äôm unhappy being who everyone thinks I am... and I just wish nobody knew me at all"
412,"I have been thinking about suicide alot again. I have been suicidal before in my teens because of depression, social anxiety, and i got bullied alot. Now i'm 20 and have been out of school for 2 years and i work now. I felt alot better not having to go to school anymore. Because of my 0 social skills i decided to become a trucker and i enjoyed it at first. But now i'm extremely lonely. I have no friends and I always work alone. When i get home from work i just sit in my room browsing reddit and watching youtube (even in the weekends). I'm just in this cycle of working alone -> going home sitting alone in my room -> work  -> home .... I don't do anything and i feel like a slave just working and then going to his cell. I am feeling very suicidal again and i decided that i don't want to go down that path again. So i quit my job, my last day is 31/7. I have no idea what i'm going to do after. I'm just lost. I also needed a hobby, something to do. So i bought a [Paramotor](https://www.vliegles.nl/images/thumbnails/product_image-2348-1500x844.jpg), I have been wanting to fly for a long time but never did it because it is expensive. Now i just said fuck it and spend like all my money on it. Parents think i'm crazy but whatever. I hope i can figure out how to be happy. But if i don't a paramotor is a nice way to commit suicide. When flying you literally have death at your fingertips. I can just crash the thing from high altitude and ill be dead. Also it will look like an accident so people won't think i'm a loser that commited suicide but just had an accident. Thanks for spending the time reading this. I have nobody to talk to and just wanted to share with somebody."
413,"Its 3:25. I usually like sleep because its an escape. But now it isnt. I dont remember my dreams, i have trouble falling asleep, i am not tired. 
What do i even do with my life anymore? 
My life is sleep-centered. I go about my entire day trying to get back to bed. I dont go to bed as soon as i get home, i rarely nap during the day, but sleep is the part of the day i look forward to. But now it's just dull. So now i hate being awake and being asleep"
414,"I know that's littleraly like the whole point I guess, but I just want to help every and I can't and I know I'm so useless, so I might aswell kill myself I just don't want to hurt anyone from it. I know they would all be okay and get over it, they always do. I just no one knew I existed so I could kill myself in peace. The thought of people being upset only makes me more upset and wanting to do it more which doesn't even make any sense"
415,
416,"I'm not doing great. Actually i'm doing terribly, I pretty much made my mind up during the week that I can't keep going. There is just no hope left for me and when I looked at some of the posts and threads, lets say there is no freaking way I will be contacting a mental health team, no chance. too many bad stories about how folk are treated. If I go to a hospital it will be kicking and screaming or knocked unconscious.

I'm so alone now, can't take it any more. I've tried before but not for a few years now. I've heard that the more attempts there are the more likely you will get it right. Maybe this time I won't mess it up. 

It would be nice to talk to someone before I go."
417,
418,I hate being alive. Like so much. It hurts to wake up everyday because I know nothing‚Äôs gonna get better because it hasn‚Äôt gotten better in years and it‚Äôs just so tiring acting like I‚Äôm fine and that nothing wrong I just wanna sleep and not wake up I feel like none of my friends really like me and I can feel them slowly getting tired of me and it just hurts because I give and give and I get shit in return in just so done I know my mom and shit will be sad if I go and I don‚Äôt want to do that to her or the few people that might get sad when I go but christ I just can‚Äôt do this anymore I‚Äôm so tired and just want to finally find peace within myself
419,"I'm at my breaking point and I don't feel good enough, I try my best to do everything I can for anyone but I never get any appreciation especially from my bf.

I do everything but yet I'm always to blame. i buy him gifts for his collection but I never get a thank you. I never thought I'd end up wanting to just take loads of pills and sleep but i don't want to burden anyone with having to deal with that. I'm trying to think myself out of this because there's no going back and I know my mother wouldn't cope"
420,"My friend was a community leader in my region for a popular video game. Recent events have caused many people to speak up over the abuse and treatment they‚Äôve received over the years. Unfortunately my friend had to be one of them. 

He‚Äôs been banned and outcasted from the community over what he‚Äôs done and I don‚Äôt blame him. He‚Äôs a sick person and did some sick things to people. But I don‚Äôt want him to kill himself. He apologized over text about the events that have happened. He went over excruciating detail on how he‚Äôs going to do it. He wants to fucking record it on his stream and have everyone see it. I have no idea what to do. He suffers from extreme schizophrenia and anxiety. Do I go to the police? I don‚Äôt even know where he lives. He‚Äôs planning on doing it tomorrow. I feel like it‚Äôs my fault for saying anything in the first place. I don‚Äôt want him to die."
421,"So my 31st birthday is today. I've never had a celebration. I've decided that if I don't get a happy birthday from all the people that ""care"" about me. I will take my life tonight. Ive fought for so long and been alone for even longer. I don't want another year of this. I thought I could hold on but I don't want to. My hope is gone and I can't fight anymore. I know this will probably be drowned out. I deleted my main account and my social media. I want to tie up any loose ends and take my life"
422,"All the people do is say ""suicide is selfish"" ""Don't do it"" ""Your taking everything away"". It just makes people feel worse. Also when people down vote someone for saying that they need help is just making it 100x worse. Because down voting can make many people just feel worse and more useless when they aren't."
423,"It sucks I wanted to do it tonight but I know my family is having a get together tomorrow and I dont wanna be a party pooper honestly.
Um but, after I thinking hard about it."
424,"Context: i am 16 she is 16 , we have been dating for over a year now , she has anxiety and depression and ptsd caused over her ex that was abusive

One day i discovered her texts with a guy , note she has been away from me , not intimate moments for over 2months so i get suspicious and read theire texts they were basically flirty. After reading it i said to her you can keep being my gf and we try to work this out or you can keep talking to him. She said she wanted a break from us . Then her mother came in and some harsh really harsh stuff and she took alot of xanax.. i am not at her house and she sent me a text saying ""be the happiest person alive"" so i rushed to her house and got to her in the bath hot water ready to die there barely conscious. We call 112 they come she gets to hospital and we get the news, everything will be alright. I am realy marked from it and i have nigtmares every single day and this happened 3 weeks ago. Now we arent together anymore, we are very good friends , she will focus on herself and for once she will be happy. Everyone who sees this you are stronger you will be happy, maybe you are down low now but you will find someone who makes you happy , she was down low 3 years in a abusive relationship and now will be better than ever, of course there are bad days but in the end she will be happy. Never give up on yourself everyone has the right to be happy and you arent an exception.  I love you and you are free to dm me anytime you feeling low , i will be open to ear your story"
425,"I‚Äôve struggled with depression pretty much my whole life. Every day I think about how no one would really miss me if I was gone. My family doesn‚Äôt talk to me and I have no friends. I‚Äôd love to not be obsessed with suicide as much as I am, but I just know that‚Äôs how I leave this world. Not soon, but eventually I will be able to do it."
426,"Things were going so well these days, but of course i had to ruin everything to everyone and myself, its the only thing i do well, i never met somone this useless.

My drawing are not getting a lot of likes even though i try my best, i keep reposting to advertise my commissions but only one person actually reached out(and i dont think they liked the final piece) i cant seem to draw anything good today, even if i switch to doing something else  it wont make my problem and my uselesness go away im still a talentless piece of shit.

They said i had hyperfocus but if thats the case where is it bc im not good at anything and all it does is make me feel horrible and want to end stuff.

If it wasnt for my parents i wouldve killed myself ages ago, i wasnt made for this world i dont serve a purpose

Fuck we were supposed to have a fun night me and ky parents but i ruined everything bc ill get them worried, i hate it hate ihate it i want to punch myself as hard as i can but im a chicken fuck"

429,"It‚Äôs been such a long long journey since may, but it still feels like yesterday. He was 63 years old and ****trigger warning***** hung himself in the backyard shed.. I was so confused and hurt. Still am.. I know it‚Äôs always ‚Äúdon‚Äôt blame yourself‚Äù and things if that nature but I always catch myself thinking of moments with him that could‚Äôve been warning signs and I never paid attention. When stopped smiling as much.. when he started asking for kisses more often.. when he started sleeping with the light on .. I saw all of this but still paid no attention. I was very very close to him, I don‚Äôt have a father around so he was my father figure.. and I feel like I failed him.. I should‚Äôve saved him and I regret it everyday I breathe without him... do these feelings and thoughts ever go away .."
430,"I threw my body in the middle of the busy street and killed my self. Was so easy, was so peaceful, was so painless. Was a dream."
431,"ive started to self harm on a daily basis again, and to be honest its the only thing keeping me from ending it all. self harm is the only coping mechanism ive found that actually works. ive told my parents, and they said to stop but wont send me anywhere because the cuts arent super deep. they wont set up another appointment with my therapist because ive told them i dont like her, so theyre working on finding a new one. they dont realize that i need someone to talk to in the mean time. a professional. i just want to go to inpatient, maybe even residential. things are too hard right now. i need a BREAK."
432,"Trying to feel something, self harm, self injury to feel some sense of love from humanity, family. im done living in this world as someone with aspergers. all i have felt is loneliness and pain, excrutiating loneliness about my life. i came this far erase my memories, erase my scars, erase my loneliness. no one will accept me in this world. why was i born, why am i living is this what i will live the rest of my life. A long infinite hell, humans are supposed to treat us like cattle? like nothing? do i even deserve to be alive. this is the end im gonna hang myself and end my fucking life. im so done with life and everything. This is a farewell to myself and a search for freedom, im giving up on life. goodbye"
433,"I‚Äôm going to remain anonymous and I‚Äôll delete this after 24hrs (sorry for my english)
I‚Äôm 16 years old,loser , I had friends but one true friend, my whole high school life I got bullied they called me t-rex because I had a big mouth,laughing at my appearance making jokes about me even in school and teacher is there,one time our english teacher asked us about exemplers of adjectives and I swear to god the whole class started saying ‚Äút-Rex the big dinosaur‚Äù ‚Äú t-Rex got a giant mouth‚Äù ngl sometimes we joke about our appearance but these ‚Äúfriends‚Äù went so hard on me,the whole school knew me by my ‚Äúnickname‚Äù, it got soo bad , I look at my self in the mirror and I can‚Äôt stand it,  So I heard about some of my ‚Äúfriends‚Äù moving to another school like a cooler one so i was like fresh start! New me! One of my ‚Äúfriends‚Äù turned up on me because he couldnt stand me, i was cooler than him so he told the cool boys idk what they call them in usa about my past and my nickname and soo the bullying started and this time is just too brutal,it went sooo hard I became fucking alcoholic, they made fun of me not just my appearance but anything related me , I told that to my father he didnt give a fuck , my mother didnt believe me and started whooping my ass I don‚Äôt know why my parents dont like me here‚Äôs another thing, my parents like my older brother , he‚Äôs handsome, cooler, social, lady guy , and here I am, a fucking loser who play video games just to forget about his shit life (don‚Äôt tell me ur a teenager this is normal stuff) when I was 7 years old my brother yeah the same guy started to make fun of my mouth making gestures with his hands , puting one hand on his upper lips and one hand in the other lips like a dinosaur and shouting ‚Äút-Rex‚Äù I was fucking 7 years old! I‚Äôm not social I don‚Äôt have any friends right now no one gives a fuck about me even when I was dating a girl she was not hot, she even said to me what a goddamn mess u got there( reffering to my face) even my fucking mom bullying the shit out of me ,retard, mangolian, a lizard( I‚Äôm skinny lol that‚Äôs why she calls me a lizard) ugly mess , t-rex

I just want someone to talk too or have a good time with....."
434,"And I only did it because I'm afraid I might do it wrong have to deal with the pain and stuff for a long time.
Still, I'm going to talk to my family tomorrow morning and tell them about it.
I'm not confident about my future, and it might be cowardice that's making me do this but I'm going to try."
435,"Today I thought I'd text a mental health hotline and got nothing but automated responses. I'm tired of it, I'm tired of everything. Everyone around me has something or someone that makes them special, happy. I have nothing, no talents, no hobbies, and the only significant other I ever had abused me mentally. I would never consider good with women, even if I've had a few exes. Too bad all of them either treated me like shit or I rushed everything and made a fool out of myself. I'm stuck working a shitty part time job until I have to leave all of my friends and loved ones in August. In the meantime I get to hold back from putting a belt around my neck and trying to end it all, but I'm too much of a bitch when it comes to pain and I'm scared of what awaits me on the other side, whether it be eternal damnation or my consciousness ceasing to exist. I just need someone to help stop me from abusing myself."
436,"First of all, I live in Brasil. They could't give any more shits about sucidal teenegers.

Last year I had to lock up college - my dream since I was 10; I just wanted to help pleople out- because of twi suicial attemps. It broke my heart beyond reperable.

I'm back to med college now. With my freshman. And it's so fucking humiliated and every time I answered anything they'd glare at me. So I stopped talking. At all.

Last nignt I freaked out. I went on an uber to a place I know sell weed. It was sold out.
I don't even like weed!!!

So I jusf wandered around the neighborhood and found an open bar. Grabbed a couple of beer's and head out.

I don't knon why I did this. I guess I just wanted to die.
I still do. All the time.


Thank you for ur pacience, if was jusf me vomiting words.
English is not my first language, apolorize for error.
Have a great night.

Ps: i'm heavely on prescribe drugs, so sorry for everyfyin"
437,"Someone in my life once told me that talking about my suicidal thoughts meant I would never do it. That I wasn't serious. That I just wanted to put my problems on other people. That's not true. 

I've talked about them recently because it's what they say I should do. They say to let people in. To talk. I've made a plan and I have to get it out of my head so I'm posting here. 

I've been oddly ok with dying for a very long time. More recently I've felt myself becoming more active in achieving that. I attempted suicide a few months ago. I failed due to family intervention. 

This time though, I've made a plan. I have a month to write my letters, get my financial things in order, and cover any loose ends. I've given myself a month to try and give the people in my life some good memories of me. I also want more good memories of them to carry with me. Once the month is up I plan to commit suicide. 

I want to be away from home so my family doesn't associate loved places with my death. I know how and I know it'll work. It would have last time had I not been found. I feel like this huge weight has lifted from me. I'm more at ease than I've been in years knowing I have a plan. 

I obviously can't talk about it with my family or friends. I've just felt such relief that I needed to get it out and 'say' it."
438,"I'm not feeling too good today, these last few weeks haven't been the best and it's all starting to hit at once. I lost my grandma, an uncle, a few girlfriends, a really important scholarship, the emotional intimacy I used to have with my current girlfriend, and I might lose my best friend to surgery complications soon.

I think at this point the only thing keeping me from suicide is practicality. I don't want to shoot myself in the head because I don't want my mom to have to see that. I could shoot myself in the chest and hope that I hit my heart, but my shotgun is too long for me to be able to pull the trigger at that angle. 

But I'm digressing, do y'all have any success stories about what happened when you didn't pull the trigger? I don't know what I'm going to do with my life if I don't kill myself, and some inspiration about what to do would be really nice."
439,"I wish i was soldier or from tank crew with my mates we fight or we smoke, it doesn't matter about tomorrow cause we living for today."
440,"I'm worthless. My family deserves better than a waste of oxygen that is me. Why the fuck do I exist, what purpose."
441,"I haven‚Äôt spoken to any of my friends in 3 months since high school was out. Literally, I‚Äôve just been sitting in the house alone rotting away. I get up in the mornings play computer all day then sleep, that‚Äôs been my routine for months now. I‚Äôm so alone and tired of this shit life."
442,I've made two attempts to kill myself (one sober) and I'm tentatively saying that I'm out the other side of all that. I spent time in a psychiatric facility after my last attempt and thought if anyone had any questions on what that's like (it may be looking like an option for you if you're here) or just generally need someone to talk to I'm here.
443,"I need to tell this story. Because nothing has gone right at any stage and I've gone from feeling on top of things to consistently wanting to throw myself off my balcony in the space of a week. I'm a 31 year old male living by myself in a 1 bedroom apartment in the Melbourne metro area. I work as a team leader for a company, currently working from home due to the pandemic. I'm single. I have a condition called acromegaly which requires daily treatment and incurs a lot of medical costs.

Over the last 4 months my workplace has been cutting costs and shedding any jobs they can in order to counter the lack of referrals we've had since la corona kicked off. In this timeframe my workload has tripled. I've gone from looking after a single team of 6 people to managing 20 people across 2 teams and having to liaise with key stake holders far more than I am comfortable. This sort of work is not in my wheelhouse and I've not been comfortable with it. Not that I've had a choice.

This Monday just gone, I had a meeting with my new boss (reporting to her for around 8 days at this stage) and she has casually lumped me with a handful of tasks that I don't know how to get down while juggling my existing workload and meeting all the existing targets I have and I...broke down. I lost my cool, on the verge of tears talking about how this workload is draining me and how this isn't the sort of work I signed up to do. Then it was over and I moved on to my next meeting and continued with my work, miserable but able to continue working. I then get a Zoom call from my boss again and a rep from HR. I attempt to play it off, giving her an update on everything that I've got done in the 45 minutes since we last spoke to no avail.

They advise me to take the rest of the day and Tuesday off because they're ""worried about me"". I attempt to fight this because a day and a half off isn't going to help me when my workload will be waiting for me when I get back and I really don't want to lose time. I'm told I have no choice as my boss's boss is now involved and they ""want to make sure I'm alright"". I'm not happy about this but again I have no choice. So I log off and...try to do anything else. Unsuccessfully. I went from being mildly anxious and stressed to full blown depressed in the space of 10 minutes. I spent most of that day and a half sleeping.

Wednesday rolls around and I log on to start my day. I get a call from the HR rep who tells me that I can't come back to work until I've got medical clearance to return. She tells me that our EAP (employee assistance program) or a GP can provide this document. I'm not even remotely happy about this so I channel my inner Karen and email my boss's boss and the HR manager with my concerns in a well written request to have this overturned. It was denied...6 hours later. Boss's boss says that they'll keep my on paid leave until Monday but I need a letter clearing me to return before I can come back. In this time frame I have contacted EAP (twice) and contacted my GP, neither of whom are able to write this letter. My GP gives me a psych referral claiming that they might be able to write said letter. I start looking for psych appointments at short term notice and decide to try my hand with EAP again.

The person I get through to indicates initially that they may be able to help. I talk with them for 20 minutes before bringing up the letter again, to which they advise that they can't provide me something like this. I'm frustrated here, yell something alone the lines of ""What's the point of any of this then?!"" and hang up. After this I'm feeling lost. I go to the local shopping centre to visit the pharmacy to get some prescriptions filled. I get food on the way home. I get home, sit down and I'm about to eat my food when I get a call on the intercomm. 

It's the Police. EAP called in a welfare check. I politely tell them to piss off and indicate I wont let them into the building. This happened once before (an ex-girlfriend being a possessive pain in the ass) during which when I opened the door a crack to tell them to go away, the shoved their foot in the door and shoved a gas dispenser in my face looking to subdue me. They then forced their way inside. I'm not letting that happen again. 15 minutes after I've told them to go away, they knock on the door having got inside the apartment complex. I again tell them to piss off and refuse to open the door. After some back and forth they offer to have an emergency psych consultant call me to chat. I agree to this hoping this might help me get my letter. No call ever came through. This is still Wednesday.

Thursday rolls around and with no call from whoever the Police said would call, I'm left still looking for a psych appointment. I'm about to give up when at around 2pm, I land a telephone appointment for 7pm that day. I book it in and I finally relax a little hoping that this will finally get me the documentation needed by Monday. 7pm rolls around. Then 7:15. I call the reception for this place, voicemail. I send an email. Nothing. 8pm. I give up. Disheartened once again. Deflated. Dejected. Helpless. I got to sleep.

Friday. 8:30am. I get a call from the receptionist for the company that stood me up. They offer to rebook me for 1pm. I'm elated. Energetic again. I accept. I get a follow up call from the psych apologising for the previous night blaming a scheduling issue. 1pm appointment confirmed. I get up, slightly revitalised. I eat some food and have a shower, suddenly aware it's been a while since I'd done both. I relax and enjoy myself for a few hours until the appointment.

1pm. Got the Zoom invite and jump on a call with the psych. Explain the circumstances and what I need assuming she will then ask me some questions to get an idea about me. I volunteer as much information as I can and explain the outburst as a result of my workload and how work is concerned for my safety. She...doesn't believe that's why work requested said document. She talks about how my manager must have felt threatened by my actions and talked about how I can't go around threatening people in the workplace. She then talks about how my appearance itself must be very threatening and how I should do something to mitigate that by trimming my beard and tying my hair back (I'm a big guy with wild curly hair and a quarantine beard currently). I follow along with what she's saying and try to point out that the outburst was directed inward at myself rather than outward at another person. She doesn't believe me. I express my concerns about the fact that she's not really listening to what I'm saying and rather just pushing what she believes happened. She then says that if we can't communicate then we should end the session now, tells me she wont be charging me and moves to wrap things up. This was at the tail end of a half hour conversation. I try to talk her down citing that I'm not saying these things to disagree with her but because it's important to have a meaningful back and forth and that I was worried she was getting the wrong idea about me. She doesn't care. The session ends. I break down in tears. I go to sleep.

Friday evening. 9:30pm. I don't know what to do. I don't know where I stand or if I'll even have a job on Monday. I can't believe this cancerous week I've had and I'm terrified of what the future holds. With my health issues, I can't afford to be unemployed right now. This genuinely scares me. There's no way I'll be able to enjoy my weekend. I can't eat, I can't enjoy myself. I'm convinced work has done this because they want to get rid of me. I'm so tired of this. I'm tired of everything. I don't want to keep on struggling against the world when the world is clearly telling me I'm not meant to exist. I'm not meant to have a life or stability. I don't know why any of this happened. None of this is fair and I'm mortally tired. I genuinely want to jump. To be free of all of this pressure. To be free of everything. This life has been cruel, unjust and unkind to me."
444,"The title says it all. For nearly eight years now I‚Äôve been struggling with thoughts of killing myself. I‚Äôve called helplines, been to counsellors, psychiatrists and medicated but it all just ends up the same every time.
 Everything hurts so much and I just want to be alone. I can‚Äôt stand being around people, even my two closest friends are becoming too much for me to handle. 
I can never get the thoughts in my head to go away. Vivid imagery of me harming myself, or my lifeless body hanging from something are just becoming too much for me. I‚Äôm worried one of these days I‚Äôm going to impulsively kill myself. 
I want to self harm. I miss the familiar sting of the blade slicing my skin open.
Tomorrow my girlfriend invited me to come swimming in her aunts pool. Right now, that‚Äôs the only thing stopping me from playing butcher with my body. I don‚Äôt want them to see, and be ashamed or feel bad for me. 
I often wish I could just go about my daily life, not plagued with these thoughts clogging up my brain. That I could fall asleep happily, instead of staring at my blank wall and reminiscing about all the things that I‚Äôve done while my nails dig into the thin blanket over my body. The body I don‚Äôt want. The body that I wished nobody could see, not even me. The body that I want to get rid of so badly that I fantasize about all the ways I could die."

Also my debit card with a bunch of money went missing and my dog has just been sent to the vet and might die. Ive fucking had it. I want to die but I‚Äôm too afraid to. I still have my brother in my friends who are nice to me sometimes but I still don‚Äôt want to live. I‚Äôm signing myself up for therapy but all of my friends tell me that it doesn‚Äôt even work.

447,"I am sick of people saying that, if you're unhappy with  your life make a change, even if drastic change, let go of everything and start again. 

No, that's not how it works, I don't hate my current lifestyle that it can just be changed. 

I dread my very existence that's haunted by its past and can never have a future. I cannot change the essence of my existence, I can change my job, my city, my friends, even family maybe, but none of it can change the way I am"

449,"I cut. a lot. Its gotten worse over the months, probably started in early February when quarantine hit Utah and schools became online. i never was much of a talker, i have a few friends here and there but not many. i don't do dating, my mental heath wasn't great to begin with so i didn't want to get rejected because i was the quiet kid. I was fine before the panic of COVID-19 started, and a couple weeks after it started i got depressed. Like i said, I wasn't social, so what was the problem? my theory is a lot of shit happening in two weeks that pushed me over the edge. My father isn't the nicest, not abusve, physically, but mentally. I didn't have high esteem to born with, I was never told to be proud of what i've done so i wasn't. My dad and my mom got divorced on Christmas, they thought it was a good idea to tell me, my brother, and my sister (both younger than me) after opening out presents and i was 13 thinking, ""why wouldn't they tell me first?"" but my mom said it was for the best. The next thing was two weeks after Covid was my grandpa died when his heart went out. it didn't really hit me until a week later, when i started cutting. I always loathed going to my fathers because every day i would be yelled at for messing something up. he has this thing where he thinks that if he yells, it get to my head better. it doesn't. he's also a reason why i started cutting. thats all for right now, im tired and just want to sleep, I will edit this if someone really does care to add more"
450,I‚Äôm 21 I had the most amazing dream I talked to a girl which is already unrealistic but this girl ended being everything I could ever want she was beautiful super nice always happy she was fun she was basically perfect and we dated in the dream and I actually made my parents proud of me for once I was actually happy then I woke up and remembered I‚Äôm gonna be alone forever and I cried I fucking hate my life I kept trying to fall asleep back into that dream but it wasn‚Äôt happening I just wish I wasn‚Äôt such a piece of garbage

He is so annoying he told me I don‚Äôt know anything and that I‚Äôm the computer field I can finish in 4 years and settle down and then if I do biology I‚Äôll have to do more years after college and that I will not pass the exam to be a dentist because I‚Äôm not smart and he doesn‚Äôt think I can do it . I hate him so much I just wanna hurt him and just want nothing to do with and for him to leave my life . If I talk back to him he beats me up I hate him sm and I wanna leave and be no one near him for the rest of my life.

453,"a month ago, I had a plan to kill myself. I went to the local crisis center instead. the people there were kind and all, but they didn't take me seriously.

the counselor I spoke to told me he doesn't think I'm depressed and kept telling me that killing myself would be stupid because it wouldn't solve anything. which I know is technically true, but it felt so dismissive. like he thought I was stupid for feeling the way I did.

we set up a time for him to call the next day and check in, but he said he wouldn't be concerned if I didn't answer. that hurt. I felt like he didn't believe my situation was serious. that or he just didn't care.

before I left, he asked if I still wanted to kill myself. I told him yes. and he just sent me on my way.

he called the next day, and we set up a time for one last check in the following day. but no one ever called. and honestly, that hurt. I'd had a really bad night and was counting on that call. which I guess was stupid on my part. I know it was a free service and I shouldn't complain. I just feel so hurt.

it took everything I had to ask for help. I had never asked for help before. and they wouldn't help me. because I guess I'm not ""sick"" enough. I go to work every day and I take care of my responsibilities and that means I can't really be depressed or in crisis or deserving of help. I left the center feeling like I had taken resources away from someone who was more deserving.

I'm suffering so much and I want to die and I asked for help but it wasn't enough. that was my only option. my only chance. I don't understand what I did wrong."
454,"Please. Just kill me. I'm a monster, I'm useless, worthless, hated by all my family.
Mom: You're worthless! I should kill you! I should have gotten an abortion!
Brother: *slaps me and beats me up*
Me: *tells mom and gets called a liar*
Me: *goes to my room and cuts, stabs, and burns myself to relieve the pain of them hating me*
All the while, dad's not in the picture.
No one in my family knows I cut, burn, and stab myself because they don't care. When I'm bullied in school, the only thing I can do is draw on myself and I get yelled at for doing that. All my friends, had depression before meeting me. Then, I somehow, by some grace of the moon, I cured them of their depression. They've tried to help me, but, they can't. I don't know how much longer I can live...
I think I'll just kill myself soon. And don't give me that bullshit of ""Suicide is selfish"" or ""Think of your friends"" or any of that because, you have no idea how long I have been suffering like this. I tried to kill myself when I was 3. 3 years old. 3 fucking years old."

456,"Hay 22yo male here ,first post in this sub. 

The last 3yrs been pretty fucked up for me ,even more then the rest of my life before that. I got almost beaten to death by members of a big local family clan.When I just tried to save someone else they wanted to kick to death.The lawsuit against them didnt even go before a court before it was shut  down. 

I now have a giant scar on my head and still half a tooth missing. Also I lost my job back then because of PTSD . 

Two uncles of mine died in january and my mother succumbed to her cancer after 3years of fighting.I am currently without work and hadn't much luck finding a new job.Also I am living with a friend of mine ,sleeping on his couch ,crammed between all my stuff in boxes. 

I am burned out ,I dont even wish to talk to anyone anymore ,lost many friends over the last years ,some through their drug habbits ,others through my social anxiety. 

I feel fucking burned out. Like I wont kill myself as that would make life only harder for my family. But fuck do I think about ending it alot.

The dust from my corpse floating in space for trillions of years. I want to kill myself. I want to escape so badly. I want to end it on my terms. I want to die while I'm still perfectly healthy. Maybe if I die, I'll wake up from this dream and realize how stupid it was. None of this is real. All of the so-called ""crazy people"" are one-hundred percent right. Everyone else is ignorant. They don't understand that death is the only escape. It is the only way out. If you die here, you don't go free. You need to end it on your terms. It's the only way."
459,"Life. 

I have attempted suicide about 6 times in the past 10 years. Two got me in the hospital and then a psych ward. Since I was a teenager, I‚Äôve felt the ‚ÄòCall of the Void‚Äô. I‚Äôve been self harming near consistently for over 10 years. I also became a drug addict and alcoholic. I was very deep into it for about 4 years. I am just over 1 year sober now. I didn‚Äôt care when I got my 1 year date. I don‚Äôt care about anything. I have royally fucked myself in my schooling program. I am so ashamed by that, that I asked around to see if anyone had a gun for sale. One did. I was going to exchange all my benzodiazepines and adderall for it. 

I only didn‚Äôt because of my girlfriend. In a way I hate her. She‚Äôs the only reason I‚Äôm still here. Her mom is in the hospital on a respirator for COVID. And her social circle is having major issues. But I also I truly love her. Like, she‚Äôs the one. When I think about her and what state she‚Äôd be if I killed myself, I am overcome with self hatred and fear that I no longer have the option to kill Myself.

The drugs really messed with brain. My short term memory barely exists, I get auditory hallucinations, and Im just not as smart anymore. I‚Äôve permanently messed up my head. And I‚Äôm 25. With my messed up brain, this messed up world, and the knowledge that it won‚Äôt get better, I have thoughts about killing myself more so than ever before. I‚Äôm in-between passively and actively suicidal. 

I have a good life, by any persons terms. But I‚Äôm scared of everything. And it almost seems smarter to end my life. I‚Äôm extremely conflicted. And I can‚Äôt use crisis line as I used to volunteer there. I don‚Äôt mind if no one comments on this. I just needed to get it out. I just don‚Äôt want to feel so bad anymore."

Well, almost. Failed not my final attempt of graduation work pre-defence. Next attempt is only in september. But...

I hear parents arguing. They're really angry. I'm afraid that they will come to my room now and start shouting at me.

I will have to live with these people for two more months. They said that they'll force me to study everyday and that I will not be allowed to go outside.

I want to run away somewhere.

I told my family that I'm really depressed. That I wanted to kill myself.  


It dind't mean shit to them.  


It went from conversation to a full blown argument, where I pointed out all the shitty things they ever done. They don't care if I die. They think I said that only to make them feel guilty, to villify them...

Her health is really bad and going downhill everyday and the day she dies i don't think i'll be able to live for myself. I've been using drugs for a long time to cope and for some sort of happiness and fulfilment, but now i've been sober because my parents found out after i had an extremely bad acid trip. Now i have nothing to even cope with anymore. Everyday living is such a pain and the only reason that i haven't ended everything is because of her, she said she wants to see me happy before she dies and i don't think i can do that. 

I don't have enough willpower to even try and help myself anymore, my emotions are so unstable and I've been on so many medications and seen so many therapists and nothing helps. I've gone through so many lows and suicide attempts and i thought i would've hit rock bottom by now but my emotions only get worse as the years go by. I'm just a waste of time and space. I feel like a burden to everyone. I have no friends except a couple online and now I even doubt their intentions and think they just pity me because i'm so paranoid that i'm a burden. 

I can't stop thinking about suicide or ways to do it. I can't stop hurting myself. I do nothing with my shitty life. I just stay at home and almost never go out or have any sort of interaction with actual people. My life used to be so good and I just ruined it all, i'm just a drug addicted fucking failure. I'm so lonely i don't think i can cope much longer, i don't want my mom to feel the pain of losing me because i know she'll end her own life if i do, she has no other proper family.

I can‚Äôt even pretend put a happy face on for my boyfriend anymore so he‚Äôs probably going to leave me any minute too. Why the FUCK was he even with me the first place.

469,"I usually don't post on reddit, kind of scared to thanks to social anxiety leaking into the virtual world as well. But I have nowhere else to turn to right now so I'm forcing myself to post here.

I wholeheartedly believe I have no future. 

I am unemployed, and have no skills employers find desirable(I have been applying to many places for the past three years, trying different tips and tricks I found on the internet on how to make applications more likely to catch an employers eye, listing only relevant past jobs and volunteer work I did in highschool, and am still lucky to just get an email to let me know they don't want me).

I am absolutely dependent on my father for financial support as I don't have a single penny to my name nor a driver's license, but he only makes my emotional and mental state worse.

On the daily, he finds any small reason to blow up and tell me how much of a burden I am, despite doing everything he asks me to do. Dog had a small accident in the hallway, even though I walked them three-four times in two hours like he asked? Obviously I'm at fault and am a useless b!tch, I must have not walked them and lied about it. That's just one example.

He makes me feel like such dead weight, I feel guilty for even eating. So I don't. Why waste precious food that he spent his hard-earned money for on me? I'm already wasting his money by just using the toilet and showering, water bills are a thing.

And God forbid I try to tell him how I'm feeling. Somehow he'll turn it on me, saying I'm crazy, that I'm being disrespectful and ungrateful, that I shouldn't complain because he's keeping a roof over my head.

If I'm this much trouble, maybe everyone would be better off if I just died. No one would have to deal with me again. No one would ever have to carry me again and be disappointed in me again. I'm sick of being a let down. I'm sick of having to face a future that is nothing but a dead-end in a dark hallway.

I'm sorry if I made this too long. I just have nowhere else to express all of this and not be afraid..."

471,"I'm not proud that I had to, but I'm proud that I did. Suicidal ideation has been hitting me hard recently and it all came crashing on me this evening in a downward spiral of not knowing what I want in life and using that as a weapon to destroy the good things that I have. I don't know what paths to take to happiness, for me or my loved ones, and I'd rather just take myself out of the equation.

I didn't die today, though."
472,"Hey, I was wondering if anyone could shed some light on why I feel this way


Basically, I am a 24 year old female and ever since I was around 12, I've continually for different lengths of time went through periods where all I can think of is commiting suicide. 

Half the time, I do really want to die. I just think my life is terrible and there is no hope for me. I feel like life almost becomes too much, things affects me so much and just the thought of future life challenges just makes me want to end it. Almost as if I'm too weak. It is almost a comforting thought knowing it is an option. 

It is a constant feeling of how could I do it? where can I do it? when? I also think alot about how it'd affect people. When people hurt me, I go to that dark place and think well this would show you how much you've hurt me. Terribly selfish I know. 

The other half of the time I just think about it but I'm fairly certain I'd never do it. 

The times in my life when I don't think about suicide are when I have alot going on. When I have a busy/happy life. When I got to the age of 12 my parents started moving me around alot, so I've spent alot of my life alone. So I think this is what started it. I'm very close to my mum as she has been my best friend all my life but she is generally quite a sad and depressed person so I wonder if that has affected me to..

But even though I'm an adult now, it's still there. It feels like a dark cloud that's always there, waiting. Up until the start of lockdown, I hadn't had those feelings for around 2 years (maybe the occasionaly one but it was the happiest i'd ever been). So yeah, it's back.. how can I fix this? How can I fix myself? I put so much energy into trying to make myself happy but I just feel lost now."
473,"As it's the beginning of the month, I'm at my computer paying all my online bills, and I just see them all piling up, Student Loans, Electric, Internet, Gas, etc. And it's just too much for one person to deal with. But then if I end it, I'll no longer have to deal with all these bills and the like. It'll finally set me free from everything. 

But it just won't happen will it."
474,"So a little forward, I'm a 19 year old male college student and i've  been depressed for the past 7 years.  I've never attempted suicide, though I think about it multiple times a day, and have never physically harmed myself.  But I do often fantasize about killing myself and for the better part of the past 7 years have seen ending my life as a net positive.  Anyway, I decided to write a hypothetical suicide letter just as a way to vent and get out my underlying frustrations with life and organize my thoughts on why I'm truly so miserable.  I'd appreciate anyone's insight into the letter.   
PS:  I talk about a lot of my fundamental beliefs here and don't really justify my reasoning for them just because I'm not trying to convince anyone of them, I'm just explaining them so  people get why I'm so upset.  

Anyway here it is:

I believe every human since the dawn of civilization has been entitled to a peaceful life full of all the resources which can be given to them as long as it doesn't detract from another's life.  In exchange, for this gift, all that a human need give is the bare minimum of what is necessary for the system which they benefit from to remain stable and able to continue its duties for the forceable future.  This isn't the case, and never will be.  That is acceptable.  What isn't acceptable is that I, and the overwhelming majority of all humans to ever exist, have been robbed of most of the potential joy which would've otherwise been found within their lives.  Since the dawn of civilization itself, social hierarchies have forced the majority of a population to sacrifice resources which, in a just world, they should be entitled to, in order to give a small minority ridiculous amounts of wealth.  This has always been the case but what is so disheartening about it is that this has continued to happen throughout the 20th and 21st centuries.  The majority of the western world has, in this time, been educated enough to understand the unjust arrangements they have found themselves in and yet little progress has occurred.  Whenever the people become upset enough to finally rise up and and rearrange the established social-order, they are thrown a bone by the elites in order to stave off starvation for a couple more decades.  Whenever this hasn't been the case, in nations such as the Russian Empire, or China, the successor states have also failed to create an egalitarian society full of a sufficient amount of prosperity for the general population.  This has led me to the conclusion that humanity at large will forever be in the servitude to horrible tyrants.  Rather than conform to this structure, and live a meaningless and unfulfilling life of Consumerism as a wage-slave to the elite, I will be ending my life.  

Make no mistake, this is indeed a spiteful action directed toward elites who will likely never know I died or why and who are even less likely to even care.  Regardless, I'd prefer to give my life in service of a minuscule ""fuck you"" to the established political and economic elite of the United States rather than conform and live a life of limited happiness in which the vast majority of my time will be spent laboring away making the very men and women rich who are, in their greed, stopping me and the rest of humanity from being able to spend our limited lives in a way we individually see fit."
475,Why is trying to kill yourself so hard and scary? I‚Äôve tried killing myself so many times that I lost count and all of those attempts failed cuz‚Äô I was too much of a coward to kill myself. Why is it so scary when you are actively trying to kill yourself and why is it not scary when you are just thinking about it? If only I had the fucking courage to actually take my own life but I guess I suck so badly and I‚Äôm so incompetent that I cant even properly kill myself.

477,"I dont want to live anymore. I keep thinking I can try and make things better, but it never gets better. I hate myself to the core. Every aspect of me. I dont enjoy anything, I dont have any qualities I enjoy about myself, and I'm never going to. I've spent my whole life in this state and it's only ever gotten worse. I dont want someone to talk me out of it or tell me how to fix it; I've tried, it doesnt work. I just wanna know how to die. I've tried cutting, overdosing, did not go well. I've realised that despite having a decent pain tolerance I'm extremely scared of pain. I'm not scared of dying anymore, the thought doesnt even unnerve me at all, it just seems peaceful. I just cant get past the pain. I've thought about getting a gun, but I think even if I did I'd have the same issue. I think the only way I can actually do this is if it's not actually me doing it. I need to either find some indirect way of making myself die, or find someone else to do it. I know assisted suicide is illegal in the us except for terminally ill patients in some cases, but its a big world. Where can I go to have someone put me down without breaking the law, preferably without needing much in the way of money."
478,"One year ago today I tried to end my life. It was my most recent attempt and although the likelihood of dying was slimmer than I would have liked, I am surprised that I‚Äôm still alive today. I just can‚Äôt help but wonder when my next attempt will be"

I noticed a pattern. When you get better once and 1 or 2 days later you get depressed again, you just relapse worse than before, and worse that the past week. You think that you mildly improved, and the next day you just wake up way worse than before. 

When I feel active, I just want to be the best, i like again my hobbies and I start taking more care of myself, you just become happiest and most active... For a day or 3. 

I just noticed about it recently. Does it have an explanation?"
481,"A short essay on how I'm a failure and all around piece of shit¬†


I never thought I had much of a purpose in life, and I'm okay with that fact, but I am sure that if I did have a purpose this isn't it and i am the only one to blame¬†

For starters I have always been a shitty person, not from the lack of trying to be better, just never being as good as I can be. My family is forced to love me because y'know being family and stuff, and I feel so fucking sorry for my friends cause they choose to hang around this waste of space.¬†


I had one friend thought I felt the most comfortable around, I could just be myself. I would do anything for him, and always wanted to be there to support him.

He killed himself

What kind of fucking pathetic asshole let's this happen. it's not like I didn't know what was going on, I just choose not to take action. I failed him on so many levels and I'll be eternally sorry to you max.but I do not deserve your forgiveness. The pain I feel now that your gone is more than I can bare, but it is pain I know I deserve to have.


My failure ways continue after hes gone though, even though my friends foolishly put there trust in me, I still care about them and want to help them through this as much as possible but I cant. I can't stop there pain or make them hurt less. Every word I speak pushes them further and further back. I want to help. Im doing the opposite. Knowing your hurting the people you love most is worse then any other I have ever felt. I failed max. And I continue to fail my other friends.¬†

Everything would be better if I killed myself, maybe not right away but people would get over me, and fuck it would be so much easier for me. 


To conclude, im an asshole guy, who just sat and watched as his best friend turn to suicide, and now i sit here knowing I can never help him, nor can I help any of my other friends. I'm a loser, asshole, fuck up, waste of fucking oxygen and space, and I want to die. But most importantly I'm a failure, I'm so sorry"
482,"Theres so much corruption
So much greed


The more this year goes on the more i feel more comfortable with the idea of ending it all. I want to stay informed but honestly its killing me. But the guilt of stepping back kills me more.

Its the thought of knowing I'll never amount to anything. And i have no control over what happens in regards to the economy ineveitably crashing or just the whole pandemic rn

Its hard to see the good anymore. The 2 things keeping me alive are my fiance and the fact that there isnt a painless way to die. Thats it."
483,"With my current situation doctor told me that I have cancer cell. Resting in the hospital bed as to my final moments, suddenly the beeping slowly stops. I felt a relief, ""Finally"" I said, I enter to the void of nothingness. And then the heat of the sunshine wakes me up, a new day. T'was all just a dream. It felt real, I wish it was."
484,"I just don't see any other way. Im so tired of failing at everything. Pushing away everyone I love. I'm so tired of being afraid. All this, for what? To die regretful in 50 years? It doesn't sound worth it to me."
485,"Instead of calling the authorities on you, getting you stripped of both dignity and freedom and making you lose all the trust you ever had ‚Äî all that to keep you ""alive"".

Contrary to popular believe telling me that it's okay to end my life does not make me more likely to follow through ‚Äî it's rather the opposite."
486,"im suffer from a major chronic illness flare up, i have 2.

I can barely function and one is causing extreme stomach pain for days now, can‚Äôt eat, use the restroom.

i‚Äôm seriously done. this not a way to live life, in pain and exhausted all the time."

488,"I met this one kid through an anonymous chatting website. They have already called IDHS, but it didn't help, they didn't believe the child was being abused. The parent as the kid said was acting two-faced. I managed to get this kid's twitter. WHAT THE HELL DO I DO?"
489,I feel like giving up i want to just die im tired of trying and things not working i wish this building fucking collapses and i could die.
490,Can‚Äôt take much more.

493,Anyone else here decide on drinking yourself to death?  I don't think I'm brave enough for suicide so I just drink everyday
494,"Since I was 9 I felt depressed and almost took my life when I was 11. It went away when I turned 12 and Now me as a 14 year old can never get sleep. My thoughts race everynight and it gives me a massive headache, going to sleep at 3 and even 4 sometimes and waking up at 11:00 AM and then feeling depressed from the thoughts I just go back to bed or browse YT never talking unless I have to. It's always the bad things too. Me getting whipped, punched or yelled at are common. And I was wondering if this is an actual medical concern. If you got this far and know what it is please let me know and if i should tell someone."
495,"I don't know why I'm reaching out now of all times, but it seems appropriate, since I just told my family how much I disregard the value of life after getting a R1000 speeding fine. They couldn't understand why I would put myself in danger like that. The truth is, I take stupid risks all the time, because it excites me that there a chance of me dying by ""accident"". I don't know why the notion of death is so attractive, but I can't seem to escape it. 

They tell me how the crime in South Africa is terrible and that they don't feel safe anywhere and they don't understand how little I care. I just don't value myself enough to care. I don't value life in general I guess, because when you've been craving to die for so long, it causes you to not care about the living (well this is the case for me at least). 

More-so, they try to make me feel guilty about it, saying: ""suicide is selfish"". However, I feel that, what is more selfish is to make someone feel obliged to stay alive for the sole reason of sparing your pain. Hence, I won't hear any of that BS. My mother had three kids. WTF are the other two, if not backups? I mean, in the 1800s, life expectancy was between 38 and 44 years. Nowadays, hospitals have become so good, that you probably have a higher chance of dying from a refrigerator falling in you than dying at childbirth. I mean, I was born with double pneumonia or something along those lines. That had to be a sort of sign: some people are just not meant to be. But no, I was saved through bloody medical technology. 

I see so many people that are so content and naive about so many things: ""The future will sort itself out""; ""Population growth is fine""; ""Climate change isn't real"". I wish I was that fucking stupid. Then I'd be able to treat any harsh situation with indifference and not care about the future at all. 

I did had a girlfriend for a few months and she has been the greatest thing for me. I never knew what I was to anyone and I never had a real reason to be. I mean family are born with you. They're stuck with you, but for someone to choose you is a lot more special I guess. And I don't think it's healthy to draw all ones self-worth from one person, but no other way makes sense to me. I can't find a source to find intrinsic self-worth anywhere. 

Also I've seen that this kind of through process is common amongst the INFP personality type. Many seem to say: ""I'm very creative, but at the same time I always want to kill myself""; lovely compromise. Anyway, do you guys (and girls) have any tips? I mean, what are the things that make you not feel worthless? And what is your reason to be? 

I don't know, it'd just be nice to hear from others I guess."
496,"I dont believe in an afterlife, but i stay up at night fearing an afterlife. Maybe it's kept me alive. But im also afraid of dying. I dont believe in hell, im an athiest. But i still get so afraid that when i die, ill go to hell"
497,"I don't think I actually will kill myself, but thats because I'm too scared to, and not because I don't want to. I've thought for many months. I'm really stressed at the moment. My mother is a  textbook narcissist and radical christian. I wouldn't say she was a terrible mother, but she certainly had her moments. She always passive aggressively attacks my sister for moving in with her boyfriend. She's all about how we were put on this earth only to suffer, and all that bullshit. It freaks my sister out every time she starts going on about any of that stuff.  I'm at home right now with my parents for summer break from college trying my best to be the mediator between my mom and my sister. My sister constantly comes to me for advice about what to do, even though I'm the younger brother. My dad on the other hand is one of my favorite people in the world, but I worry about him so much. He does all the work around the house, handles all the finances, 90% of the cooking and cleaning. Takes care of all the animals (I basically live on a farm), and nobody takes care of him. I try my best when I'm home to help him as much as I can. I bust my ass to help him out, keep my mom off her mean side, and protect my sister. Me personally, I'm so lonely and sad all the time, I don't have any friends really, and I'm just so tired. The idea of not existing anymore seems so wonderful. I wish I could just go to sleep and not wake up."
498,I wanna die so badly but everytime I hear about someone else's suicide I get so sad that I just cry for hours and can't get any rest. I'm so sorry for anyone who's in so much pain... Why does it have to be this way? It hurts too much.
