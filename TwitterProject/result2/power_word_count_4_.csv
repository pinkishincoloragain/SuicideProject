 don't forget your wellbutrin you're tender without it but uselessness never goes away; luck is ever out of reach
 super upsetting that people would risk suicidal thoughts mania headaches amp; vomiting rather than just loving their fucking bodies (or changing them in a healthy manner if they could be happier w them) contrave
 i kill one or two and leave their dead bodies in place for the others to discover as a warning to the rest they usually remove the bodies presumably to bury in ceremony and never return
 wellbutrin daily ativan or rhovane when absolutely necessary i would not be here without them and anyone who thinks i just need to do yoga or change my diet can get in the fucking sea 
 i'm on cymbalta (same active ingredient as lexapro amp; celexa iirc) wellbutrin was added to it when cymbalta alone wasn't cutting it anymore it did help reduce fatigue but sometimes when my rx delivery sends me a differently manufactured generic it affects me differently
 like i was in an awful place living off diet coke american spirits and a wellbutrinprozac cocktail hadnut eaten in a week and change and this angel appears out of nowhere tbh if she hadnut been there to make me break that fast iud probably have ended up in the hospital
 marry prozac  iuve been on it for a while and itus done wonders for me kill pristiq  didnut do shit for me fuck wellbutrin  one of the few iuve never been on so i feel like fucking it would give me a good trial run without too much commitment in case it doesnut work out
 christ lol all the idiots in your mentions being like medications are bad go jogging smhnxanax and friends do fuck with your sense of taste in various ways though some of the other ones (wellbutrin fex) deadenkill taste perception somewhat which sucks (
 thankful for my husband who spends every moment by my side to remind me that i am still supposed to be here and thankful for wellbutrin for making my brain stop lying to me worldsuicidepreventionday fuckcancer notdeadyet 
 if his brexit plan fails and johnson sends a letter to the eu requesting an extension so as not to contrave the benn act he could simply send a second letter saying he's changed his mind nbut this court isn't having any of thatn
 zoloft never works for me and lexapro never worked alone but i finally ended up on a combo of lexapro and wellbutrin and it seriously world amazing the only reason i ended up in a manic episode was because geisinger fucked up my meds while i was sick
 i have absolutely no idea how i made it so long without medication me with vs without wellbutrin is literally night and day being able to feel upset without wanting to immediately fucking kill myself is insane is this how the other half lives?
 wellbutrin it helps quit smoking it might make you a nervous wreck and it'll fuck with your sleep if you take it before bed it worked pretty well for me but causes heart issues if you overdose on it if your friend is suicidal help them regulate how much they have on hand
 like for me wellbutrin was a hell demon drug that made me stop sleeping entirely but iud never tell someone whose life was changed profoundly by it that theyure a fucking liar
 diagnosed with adhd within last  months  only advice i got was to take wellbutrin i've never been good at using planners or notes i'm so spontaneous  any recomendations for using this app ?
 wellbutrin changed my life this summer in fact my car died today and it took a dozen calls and  hours to get it towednormally that would've had me in the fetal in tears like it's the end of the world it was annoying but i handled it without one tear shed cheers to us
 i feel good but i've never  had the albuterol  aide affects  before  however  i didn't  sleep till  i took  zyrtec goodbye liver
 iuve been taking regular zyrtec and benadryl w no luck uddude will def try the zyrtec d tho and hopefully it helps us both thx for the rec lol all my friends are living blissful allergyfree lives and are fckn useless
 yep at the beginning of the year i started having what i believe to be mast cell related issues seeking healthus probiotic along with diet changes and a zyrtec a day have really made a tremendous impact need to get back to ben lynchus ucdirty genesud but cognition isnut great
 i had never been around cats i only learned of this when i had a sleepover at a friends house in grade school and slept on a couch  i think it almost killed me i take generic singularzyrtec daily and always take an albuterol rescue inhaler with me to strangers homes w cats
 i feel so sorry for you i looked up medicines available in the uk and i don't see any of the ones i would recommend in the us i use xyzal (levocetirizine) and i would die without it idk how you live like that
 everyone talks about not living with air conditioner or not living with this how did people live without zyrtec or any other allergy medicine? i would literally die without it
 twitter's acting upnsuffering alone would be the worst i have a caregiver so i'm never alone i know mr insomnia very well when i get desperate i take zyrtec  that's if nothing else (lavender tea progressive relaxation etc etc etc)  works  i wish for you a restful sleep
 depends what type of mucinex and what you are trying to treat guaifenesin alone is useless antihistamine like citirizine (zyrtec) or loratadine (claratin) plus pseudoephedrine (for congestion but may not let you sleep) amp; dextromethorphan (for cough) are good combinations
 nbullsht while these can b actual side effects they r rare just like many other drugs have rare side effects nndiscouraging use of tamiflu endangers lives of those most vulnerable  death from flu alone nneightyfour kids have died from flunnstop fuken with kids' lives
 would you like your flu shot with or without crippling depression and suicidal tendencies? this was the reality for one teen who ended up taking their own life after receiving a tamiflu shot  tamiflukills suicide flushot
 i get my flu vaccine every year and itus the reason i didnut die in icu flu is the suspected cause of my sepsis iud be dead without it and swine flu nearly killed me later in the same hospital stay tamiflu and the vaccine stopped me dying twice immunodeficient
 yeah until theyure fucking deadnyou read abt the  yr old who died from the flue because his mom refused to give the tamiflu prescribed and instead put potatoes in his socks? nnantivaxx propaganda kills people
 and hotez is on there saying thank you  they never let a dead body go to waste (unless its one of the many kids who died despite flu shot and tamiflu)  there is no hope for this country
 your research skills have slipped so bad that youud never pass the bar exam na national health emergency was passed in april 0 before anyone died in the us it included releasing a quarter of the national stockpile of tamiflu which saved lives
 note that change due to bias towards positive results can also happen without knowledge of the data i literally see that in the explanation modeling to see where a positive would happen with no concern about relevance  a tamiflu like drug won't help anyway
