 if you live in texas pollen count has been high for the past xdays if your having sinus pressure cough runny nose and sore throat for up to a week recommendations are flonase singulair and zyrtec off brand medications will be fine and cheaper too
 i'd lived in ks for several years before i discovered that my seasonal colds were actually allergiesnni won't allergysplain to you but i've had some luck with a generic zyrtec and flonase combo
 allegra handles most symptoms for me nothing helps the itchy sinuses even they happen except going inside a closed off building luckily there aren't any of those trees immediately around where i live
 i take zyrtec every day all year long my allergies apparently indoor allergies probably the furball feline that lives with me
 i was shocked when i discovered that there was only one pack packet of zyrtecumy preferred hay fever medication i realise people are scared and trying to find a solutionubut some people like myself canut live without hayfever medication my allergies are so severe
 zyrtec saves lives

 my friend who lives downstate (downstate il is 000s of miles of pollencorn dust air) says xyzal is the best but i cant get generic so
 xyzal is the only thing that has worked for me thus far for pet allergies (cats) and esp cause i'm horribly allergic to grass clippings  hay and live around farming ;;
 xyzal is essentially zyrtec on steroids a stronger formulation of a similar active ingredient a combo of xyzal and flonase keep me alive through all the seasons as i am allergic to every fool thing on the planet it seems

 unfortunately i could only get walmart delivery for now so i will try that one and see how it goes i also got their version of clairton to have not tried that one but i know for sure i cannot take zyrtec
 itus along the lines of washing your hands but on the insides really  why does washing hands work? because the virus is arguably not alive so if you feel that cough amp; do this list  i liken it to washing on the insides also  zyrtec decongestant is massive for flooded lungs

 vast majority of flu hospitalizations don't require anything more than what's deliverable in a tent (iv fluids and a tamiflu rx)

 if they have heart or eye problems? their lives or their visionnnand the improvement noted in the study was relatively minor they weren't cured like tamiflu it just seemed to shorten the duration of symptoms which is good but no reason to end social distancing

 juat like tamiflu anyone on twitter would know because docs have been saying it for weeks i wish trump would bring a doc with success stories  to podium to say loud and clear would save lives if other docs heard gov't restrictions  making things worseagain

 your passion for peopleus lives and being the best we can be has always shined though at some point we may be able to say that hydroxychloroquine has better results than tamiflu has with fighting common flu
 so by your ureasoningu tamiflu would need to be tested on every flu strain first please sign a statement right now that you refuse to take any treatment for the wuhan virus until it has completed rigorous fda trials darwinism is alive and well 
 hydroxychloroquine can also trigger undetected rapid heart failure especially in men it can also destroy the kidneys and liver leading to death  the csiro tamiflu antiviral is also effective in killing the virus as well  another problem is drowning from liquid in the lungs
 their lives businesses and careers nni remember during the swine flu outbreak the government stockpiled huge quantities of tamiflu in preparation for an expected pandemic it didn't come to pass but at least we were prepared i would much rather spend money on preparations

 flu can be prevented most yrs can also be treated with tamiflu i live in ca and daily i hear of deaths of kids teens young adults healthy adults and recently a baby with no underlying medical conditions our numbers are finally starting to plateau after a month of lock down
 thatus right weull be lucky if a drug does what tamiflu does let alone actually save lives inadequate chinese data today if you want to believe maybe hinted a tamiflu like effect for hcq and thatus the best data we have
 this isn't the flu we have no tamiflu for this no vaccine it is also more easily transmitted so more people get infected right now only  of nyc people have antibodies and that cost over 000 lives and that's with the shut down
 or live life but cautiously (wearing masks washing hands avoiding cesspools of contamination) to delay its spread until an effective treatment is developed like with tamiflu  i do think there's a middle ground
 fivethirtyeight  not my go to for science coronaviruses are rna viruses eg they mutate quickly like influenza finding an effective antiviral (like xofluza or tamiflu was for influenza) is imperative we can't live in fear until we nail down one or two mutations 
 i had hn during that pandemic i was able to be tested as soon as i was feeling bad and was prescribed tamiflu i was able to get the testing and care i needed we were prepared then worst i have ever felt but ium alive
 was just thinking about when i had swine uflu  years ago i felt so ill i lived with my husband and mo baby i was given tamiflu as treatment which made me more ill before i felt better did i ask anyone to have my baby whilst we were ill? no because i wanted to isolate it
 one for the history books gotta live  through it for the moment unfortunately i remember the swine flu pandemic scared the crap out of me at the time tamiflu being dished our left right and centre that went away quicker than this though but few remember it vividly now
 i had swine flu and managed to look after three children with swine flu; oh was away and i didnut want to infect my mum and dad or anyone else my dad delivered tamiflu and provisions to the back door as per govt advice

 sorry to burst your bubble i'm a nurse who gave hydroxychloroquine to pts under dr's orders pts went home alive and breathing imo hydroxychloroquine is to covid is like tamiflu is to influenza it fights the symptoms for a faster recovery quit listening to the liberal drs
 i have given hydroxychloroquine to pts per dr's orders said pts were discharged home alive and well so i personally can say i've seen it with my own eyes a cure? no imo it worked as tamiflu does with influenza we treated the symptoms until there's a cure no expect a cure
 the solution is an antiviral agent similar to tamiflu such as remdesivir nthe idea was to space out cases of the inevitable so that doctors do not have to choose who lives and dies based on scarcity of resources
 i might just flip over there every once in a while to see if they cut away for breaking news like tamiflu lorenus instacart delivery was late

 yes i contracted it boy worst flu ever  i did get tamiflu in time still sick for  days luckily i lived in a home where i could quarantine time from my family i did this without even knowing
 she is clearly telling tamiflu that she would not understand the hardships that come with being a person of color that tamiflu would not understand because she doesnut live it of course she is talking about society no where does she say that she raised her kids to believe it
 he ran the test and i had hn paid  for tamiflu  not that it would be effective but man iud try anything to not be miserable i only made about k a month and rent was  so that was a big deal work in early childhood ed if you want to live below the poverty line
 honestly we are just going to have to live with this like we do everything else  there is no cure or real treatment for the flu other than a  effective vaccine and tamiflu which is in the midst of a lawsuit  and yes i know covid is different than the flu
 donut disparage the good name of tamiflu itus useful and saves lives tamagotchi doesnut deserve that kind of praise

 the belief in tamiflu was very short lived wasnu00bt it?
 so it's tamiflu for covid but how is that probably worthless? shortened admissions for a subset sounds useful and everyone is highly vigilant for symptoms so early intervention with infusion delivery aren't exactly deal breakers gives way to mortality focus perhaps?

 canadians i know like it really well one of my canadian friends lived in north carolina for  years and was shocked when she had to go to the doc and get tamiflu her taxes aren't that high either
 if you are so terrified then by all means stay home but the rest of us are going to live our lives i spoke with my doctor yesterday on all this and he said things are under control but we will have this virus until there is a magic pill similar to tamiflu
 mumbai at a time the country is grappling with hn virus and tamiflu tablet is belived to be the only solution a wellknown medical practitioner today claimed that people can have a costeffective treatment in homeopathy for swine flu  
 no but tamiflu usually lives on her victimhood
 something that works like tamiflu just a  reduction in symptom intensity could save a lot of lives will have hcq early treatment results soon; however i'm not optimistic based on todays' twitter tea leaves
 i think that the overestimation of the swine flu was mostly honest and innocent but of course it lead to a dramatic enrichment of the ones delivering tamiflu and medical supplies this lead to an underestimation of covid
  why does it work on other virus as an antiviral? like tamiflu does? it should be up to the patient there are drugs uses for off label things i'm on one colestipol not for cholesterol but because my liver dumps bile nonstop medical choice
 if youuve ever been prescribed tamiflu and understood how that helps curb the flu symptoms if the virus is caught early itus easy to conceive how cloroquine zinc and zithromax can help keep covid patients alive while their bodies combat the virus we are the cure
 every drug has side effects even tamiflu udeudd iull take a pill before a udeudduddudc any day trump could do a live event getting a uddudc still not taking it ingrahamangle
 itus not a cure corona viruses by nature have no ucureu  but like tamiflu itus a treatment to lessen the viral impact and potentially save lives
 they bought  million doses of tamiflu amp; used virtually none of it those they did use caused narcolepsy they are filling their boots while ruining everyone's lives amp; racking up debt with their fraud amp; lies big pharma lackeys
 also  we need to be positive  this is not a cure but a treatment if caught early  like tamiflu  it wonut work on everybody each person is different  take precautions and live life  love life  we only get one  and be nice to each other
 no one on the right woulduve refused to take tamiflu for hn had obama came out amp;stated itus effectiveness you can dislike a politician amp; still give credit when they get something right if trump said sunlight is good the left would live in complete darkness just to ucget trumpud
 they keep misleading the public it appears from interviews of doctors it needs to be administered at the onset of symptoms like tamiflu is given at the onset of the flu if they'd let doctors be doctors instead of trying to tell them what to do more people might be alive
 as a nurse iuve lived through ucnewud bird flu swine flu mars mrsa hiv west nile ebola sars  influenza hn and others iuve forgotten now and we let our immune system do itus work treated early (tamiflu?) quarantined the sick protect vulnerable whatus changed?
 how old are you? like ? you've lived at least  times more than me and you are this stupid? you know how to cure the flu? influenza? you drink water and get some bed rest take some tamiflu and you're you know how to cure covid? you currently can't

 hard to completely prevent unless people live under a rock we need improved and effective therapies such as tamiflu for reg flu to help with early symptoms as well as those who are sicker hopefully the mask mandate will help slow the spread
 as someone who was flattened by schoolcontracted influenza (and the nausea of tamiflu) for a solid week in january which then took a month to completely recover i'd rather not relive the experience with a novel coronavirusnnnihilists shouldn't get to decide this for us 
 the difference is the medication tamiflu became readily available and wasn't blocked by the fdagee wonder why they are doing thatthe doctors should decideno not the rich ones that don't see patients the ones that are out there trying to save livesbutt out fdasave lives
 read this to answer your question about the difference between influenza hn where tamiflu amp; flu vaccine helped save lives while novel coronavirus is not influenza no medication has been proven to work amp; there is no vaccine to stop infection 
 asian populations have outlived massive outbreaks of coronaviruses before antobiotics how? nis there something in home kitchens matching pharmeceuticals arsenal of botanicals that works right now? i think there is maybe staranise tamiflu  cloves or combined spices 
 covid vaccine shows promising immune response results it's amazing the medication that's keeping hiv patients alive since the mid s is not a vaccine however the medical doctors are getting close to having a medication to stop covid it's similar to tamiflu medication 
 great decision dont succumb to the threats of trump now for more states to follow suit do it to save lives until there's at very least good treatment for those who contract covid (kind of like tamiflu for treating the flu)nn
 unfortunately flu vaccines and tamiflu type of medications donut kill viruses  the virus is not eradicated it lives to fight another day we need to learn to live with it as we will with covid open businesses
 ) the flu has treatments and vaccines covid doesn't if it weren't for things like tamiflu and the flushots that most people take a lot of people like my mom who's immunocompromised wouldn't be able to leave their homes during normal years without risking their lives
 elliott got it (he was  months old) and was put on tamiflu it was pretty scary i also got it and it was a shortlived but weird flu
 the winner will be tamiflu to stop the spread and save lives  it worked in the us during  and i know it will work again   it will save lives  research and test
 tamiflu vaccine can destroy the virus and it will save lives it did in 
 the hoax was the demonization of hcq zpac and zinc they have known for a long time that itus effective against coronavirus but the destruction of the economy wouldnut work if early treatment saved lives now that we know that it does itus manageable like influenza amp;tamiflu
 hey thatus insulting to tamiflu at least that drug is useful and saves lives
 age shouldn't matter period health conditions shouldn't matter they are all americans and deserve the best how many deaths? 000 american lives in  months  and the flu won't kill you if your obese or have diabetes take some tamiflu and call it a day
 yes we wouldn't want to save more lives rightnthat isn't the gop way that isn't the tamiflu way nhere i thought protecting fellow americans was a good thing nam i wrong?nis it only about the money with you people?nasking for a friend do you have any friends real friends?
 cool let's try tamiflu nextit's likely just as 'effective' in unventilated lt; yo pts which likely already have a good chance of being alive post  days
 so all that is needed is needed is    disregard wearing masks ?                    take tamiflu??                                              hope to live till ???
 so i assume you mean flu prior to vaccines and tamiflu? last time we achieved herd immunity for a deadly disease without those tools we lost millions of lives  mill in 
 when i served in peace corps amp; faced bird flu tamiflu was dispersed to all the government officials who lived on compounds amp; never left the capital several weeks before it was dispersed to the pcvs working in communities all over the countryso uddude 
 all this ego and she still can't get her own show on real tv uddude0uddude0uddude0uddude0 keep the streaming alive tamiflu
 i was told i had the flu when i knew it wasnut the flu sent home with antibiotics and tamiflu four days later i almost died from sepsis kidney and liver failure 
 remember the sarscov virus is replicating in your cells nnkill the virus w bleachuv light then you kill the cells you need to livennthese conversations (hcq too) are ridiculous we need to focus on antivirals that slowstop viral replication (like remdesivir or tamiflu)
 stop focusing on vaccine  effective need to treat before it causes long term damage to lungs work on finding a treatment like a tamiflu the virus isn't going away find a way to treat and live normally with it
 i agree and i would love to see more work done in the search for a treatment versus a vaccine the only reason we can 'live with' the flu is due to medication like tamiflu i truly believe a viable medication is what will get us back (or close to) where we were
 you're assuming all those scientists that are working on it have no morals tamiflu was rushed out for the swine flu outbreak saved thousands of lives but was fully checked
 pardon me tamiflu i had zpac once for another illness i had high fever amp; chills like for  days straight it was brutal so i don't wanna downplay it but my mom and brother i lived with never got it and my doctor wasn't worried it was a bad flu is all
 great thread  we also reported on the application of wbe for tamiflu during the  swine flu pandemic wbe was further enhanced by the fact that tamiflu is administered as a prodrug transformed to the active antiviral in the liver 
 i don't accept 000 flurelated deaths we have a vaccine which scientists develop every year before flu season begins it saves countless lives we also have tamiflu some strains have a lesser mortality rate sarscov is just getting started we had a chance; we blew it
 this is a huge disservice to americans did you know that the usps is part of the last mile delivery for some pandemic responses (eg tamiflu distribution)? 
 because i see whatus happening again  we were there to sell tamiflu rather than save lives at each step information had to be modified to meet financial goalssave money instead of saving lives
 why canut everyone who gets it take the hcq cocktail and those they live with take hcq preventively  days itus over itus not spread boom weure back to normal??? just like tamiflu the family gets a prescription also to take if they get it
 nope the flu is term for one of many flu viruses annually emanating mainly from udcuddeudcuddf bird flu tamiflu swine flu for which we have new vaccines created annually covid is a disease from coronavirus the same virus that caused sars disease time to live with them
 yes we have to live with that but we have treatments and vaccines for other viruses we know the longterm effects of those viruses we don't yet know the longterm effects of covid or how to rapidly treat it (with tamiflu for example in the case of the flu)
 it's the transmissibility that is the issue this time nni worked i the nhs back then and was part of the team delivering tamiflu across the nort eastnnwe were very very busy
 and we donut need to be testing everyone we need to be treating early with the zelenko protocol based off symptoms (just like we do with flu and tamiflu every year) and get back to living and take our lives back from the govt and politicians
 haha i posted it once as my fave red carpet look and some fans who watched it live said she said she had the flu and had taken tamiflu
 yes live virus is still shed but is that the source of thepathogenesis of covid?  or was it the exponential phase?  nni donut buy it this is the same mistaken reasoning as with tamiflu
 ask nhs helpline or out of hours doctor exactly this? when i needed tamiflu for swine flu the primary care trust was delivering angrily under duress amp; an anglican volunteer org happily amp; fast
 follow the sciencenprotect the at risk test the sick with symptoms like with the flu give covid therapeutics like tamiflu for flu if you have symptomsnthe healthy need to live amp; work 
 ium not scared bring it on covid or the flu had the flu last year felt better within about a day while taking tamiflu no need to live in fear or behind a mask
 every nation that opens up faces the same realization there is nothing we can do to stop spread as societies open back up there is no official to blame except a nasty virus we have to learn to live with and find good remediescures for tamiflustyle early remedies
 we live in strange times unitedhealthcare plans to provide atrisk patients with 000 kits that include tamiflu the prescription antiviral treatment; a digital thermometer; and a coronavirus pcr diagnostic test 
 my son was hospitalized and got great care his twin got tamiflu and didn't have to go it was an awesome response and saved a lot of lives
 blue lives matter? a terrorist org? u damn right tamiflu laryngitis 
 swine flu  a disaster? i a pharmacist worked my ass off dispensing tamiflu to the masses and saving lives all of us did trump is making up stuff again
 yep we all got it were sick but had tamiflu got through it no lingering affects went back about our lives
 only  remdesivir one medicine not all countries accepting indian doctors treating with tamiflu trying best to save lives robots but no medicine for humanitarian affairs cvirus ? n ooo  above patients in a day  in uk why ? medicines can save us from lockdown leaders???
 james you do know we have flu vaccines right?  strains which rotate annually and we have drugs tamiflu for one so we very much do not uclive with fluud you are undermining yourselfnif i thought i cld nip to my gp amp; get remdesivir at the st sign of symptoms i wld be relaxed
 he lied about hcq to make more money uddudcb0 hcq if started early on in covid is very safe and could've saved thousands of lives research done on very ill patients started too late works like tamiflu
 i also got sent to me by my insurance company a covid test an a dose of tamiflu since they are both similar donut let fear rule u yuall are big adults what do u do when u get the flu does flu spred we live through it every year

 hey idiot we have tamiflu and other safe antipyreticanalgesic drugs that make the flu less dangerous than covid hence why we uclive with itud covid however is the first known coronavirus to ever infect humans with over 000 deaths with social distancing stfu man 
 realistically how many people could get them though especially if the time to use them is early before hospitalization (so from your family doc or urgent care)? at what point does the  of infected overwhelm the supplydelivery logistics for iv mabs? this is not tamiflu

 same with any vaccine tamiflu was created in a similar amount of time to combat swine flu saved millions of lives worldwide
 tamiflu was developed in the same timescale for swine flu yeah it had some rough side effects but saved millions of lives
 yeah to hell with seatbelts and the lives they save  good one tamiflu udeudda
 the problem with covid is it can trigger an ard which can be deadly  even if the vaccine is  effective it could hugely reduce the numbers developing ards and keep them alive  similar to using tamiflu against swine flu helped prevent severe symptoms not all symptoms
 come on safe cheap and effective when we had swine flu (remember that?) primary care had tamiflu chucked at it in vast quantities even though it was not very effective here are cheap effective safe covidtreatment options and no advice about use to save lives
