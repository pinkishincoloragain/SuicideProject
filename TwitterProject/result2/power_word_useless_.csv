 any medical product  even one that isn't even claiming to cure the flu or prevent death and suspiciously right around the time of a fraud case against it?  gardasil proven useless and we have mandates to bury it  tamiflu being proven useless amp; we will have cps called it refuse
 tamiflu is known to be completely useless to reduce flu symptoms and has list of side effects that could choke a horse  
 yes except oseltamivir (tamiflu) is useless one of the biggest current frauds in medicine 
 and even if she hadn't that wouldn't make her a negligent mother given that drug is useless not even recommended in the uk 
 tamiflu is useless so much so it's not recommended here in the uk i'm surprised no doctor has intervened they just sit back while a suffering human being gets bullied for no reason shameful 
 these lying cowards implying tamiflu would have saved him in the uk i've never ever met a doctor who would recommend this medication because it's considered useless and not worth the side effects i feel for this mother  
 it's not negligent to avoid a medication that doesn't work you silly man thank god i live in the uk where our sensible national health service doesn't recommend this useless product 
 implying a child died because he didn't take tamiflu when all scientific research says it's useless is the vile behaviour of a bully and a coward you should be ashamed of yourself 
 tamiflu is just as useless lmao 
 while home remedies are generally totally useless it doesnt make the scienceside true from what i've read tamiflu is not proven to work in the manner drawing ire here overplaying its hand is what damages science's credibility the kid was in the hospital for four days 
 what bull and tamiflu is  basically useless cochrane researchers say there's not enough evidence to prove tamiflu works  tamiflu can lessen symptoms and make flu illness one to two days shorter the cdc says
 yet the kids who took the shot and the tamiflu and who died thatus no biggie?  youure not coming after pharma for making a useless product?
 tamiflu is rather useless though  it may lessen symptoms by one day and that's no promise  i'm a pharmacy tech and we give out the little sheets explaining all thisnnviruses have no cure and no real treatment  they run their course and that's it  it's a dice roll
 ium not sure that tamiflu is the best example to use efficacy is controversial and itus path to the great useless stockpile was likewise tainted with biased research now if we instead were talking about influenza vaccination in childrenu
 people should be aware of the tamiflu scam itus really infuriating to me that everyone thinks tamiflu is wonderful when itus really virtually useless  
 this is a terrible story but tamiflu is a borderline useless medication which has far more side effects than benefits there is precisely zero clinical evidence that it reduces complications hospitalization or death in healthy patients i rarely recommend it to my patients
 i am provaccine tamiflu is next to useless they definitely tell you not to get your hopes up that it will actually help it's very sad that her son died but also extremely unlikely that tamiflu would have changed the outcome
 now that is a load of bs i have had tamiflu and have nursed people extremely ill with the flu i wouldn't hesitate to give it and it isn't useless
 prescribing tamiflu looks like neglect to me useless
 first it was flu i couldn't keep water down then i'm told at carespot it's also a sinus infection a week later i'm not contagious anymore but the tamiflu has rendered me useless
 tamiflu can be used annually (though actually useless) remdesivir maybe only this year
 since you only accept the data from the uk even though you are vax pushing for the usnnlet's look more into that side of the pond well i'm actually on your side of the pond but different sides of the land useless information much like you providen
 i also had the flu late january and it kicked my butt even on tamiflu this last time they said itus useless against covid ium understanding is tamiflu is geared for influenza and not a general antiviral
 tamiflu is useless now
 tamiflu has no efficacy against covid nnpretty useless against flu too
 why do you believe the influenza death numbers? it's a billionaire dollar industry to sell useless tamiflu and scare millions of healthy people into taking a semiuseless thimerosolcontaining vaccine annually?  influenza deaths are at least fold exaggerations
 the doctor is zev zelenko mentioned here in the washington postn limiting it to sick people may make it look useless other antivirals (zinc for common cold tamiflu for flu) seem effective only if taken very early after symptoms
 my entire family was sick in early february we are convinced that we had the covid  dr thought we had flu but tamiflu seemed uselessnnnobody was thinking of covid then  and no tests were availablenni think there were a lot of cases where this was diagnosed as flu
 remember the billions spent on tamiflu which turned out to be useless?ncoronahoax
 the tamiflu guy yes its bloody useless auspolnnice screwup there tga redtapencovidausn
 i am not dismissing your comments which are always interesting ium just being cautious even in the face of controlled clinical trials (which gave us the utterly useless tamiflu)
 i hate to be a downer kinda doc but preliminary nonrandomized results are always promisingnbut then i lived through hunu craze amp; the utterly useless tamiflu so color me hopelessly jaded
 we could never be prepared for a pandemic like this it would cost too much waste to much (items go out of date and become useless) nowhere to store it letch check out how much tamiflu cost the country to stockpile  and it was useless
 tamiflu is in no way preventative tamiflu is prescribed in an attempt to limit symptoms and most doctors won't even prescribe ot for someone who has had symptoms more than a day the vaccine is mostly useless as well there's tons of available research on this
 they had to take chest xrays for pneumonia because they couldn't get lung sounds on a stethoscope becausenevery time i tried to breath deeply i coughednthey wouldn't do a flu testnsent me home with an official diagnosis of uri (cold) and tamiflu (useless for a cold)
 he took the va d c and zinc plus colloidal silver he was given the tamiflu but i told him not to take it and showed him the studies and trials that proved it was uselessnnhe was back to operating in  days normally he'd be sick for two weeks
 worse considering tamiflu has been proven to be completely fucking useless for half a decade
 urelenza (zanamivir) is useless in treating swine flunnutamiflu (oseltamivir) may help to treat swine flunntamiflu is more a preventative medicine than a reactive medicine
 yes but it was useless  tamiflu didnut actually work but we spent millions stockpiling it
 if you are wondering tamiflu does not work on wuhan corona virus i looked it up myself the news media is completely useless  covidufc tamiflu
 in contrast with umifenovir (arbidol) i have seen nothing but negative results for oseltamivir (tamiflu)  to the best of my knowledge tamiflu is completely useless in treating or preventing this illness
 i was an early case i had classic covid symptomsnthey just said i had a cold didnt even take a flu test and gave me tamiflu ( which is useless for covid or colds)nnthey arent testing
 with the flu people donut show symptoms until  days after they contract the virus that is why tamiflu is only prescribed within  hours of symptoms otherwise useless people carry diseases on them all of the time you can always be putting them at risk
 i was sent home with an official diagnosis of upper resperatory infection  (aka cold which this was not)nand a script for tamiflu (which is useless against a cold? and they didnt do a flu check anyway)npersonally i cant help but think i had at least one of the  versions
 tamiflu was useless anyway for the swine flu
 obviously you can't millions like you are still buying tamiflu and other useless medicine enriching the big pharma because they have filled your head with fear and lies the test results are scientific evidence you ignore even after who downgrade it to junk there is no cure
 trump has relaxed regulation on new antivirals the last panic about a virus gave us tamiflu a drug the uk government spent hundreds of millions on it turns out roche pharma deliberately lied in its testing itus pretty useless coronavirus 
 actually tamiflu is borderline useless
 and an economy that doesnut support paid sick leave if you have covid you have it thereus no antivirals for it (like the useless tamiflu) and itus a wait and see game for how your illness develops you treat symptoms like with the flu
 tamiflu is worthless and causes more nauseous side effects than anything  it ucmightud cut symptoms by  hours if started within  hours  itus expensive and pretty much useless
 lysol is effective tamiflu is useless corticosteroids are a death sentence
 good article what did we learn from tamiflu?nalthough the tamiflu debacle led to better science transparency governments are still paying billions to stockpile a useless drug so we probably didnut learn muchn
 i now have prescriptions for tamiflu and a strong cough suppressant also popsicles and ice cream and more gatorade time to lay down and watch mushii play ff as i be completely useless
 i had flulike symptoms (thankfully turned out to be only for one day) contacted my doc via the app his staff suggested palliative care only took gt;hr for them to place a tamiflu scrip by which time that would have been useless staff need updated protocols
 i seem to recall tamiflu was found to be useless for swine flu and yes a flu vaccine does work  if they pick the right one but they don't always get it right
 the most likely outcome is that gilead is going to make billions on a drug that shortens the course in mild disease but has no effect on mortality on severe disease it will be stockpiled forever and useless like tamiflu nninvest in gilead
 quite marvelous how quick they've created the vaccine reminds me very much of   amp; glaxosmithkline creating tamiflu amp; relenza and the govt of the time labour i think wasting u00a million on a useless vaccine perhaps i'm just being pessimistic bigpharna 
 remdesivir is probably useless for people on vents if effective at all is likely early in disease biggest impact in ltc facilities like tamiflu u as prophylaxis 
 so with remdesivir we are killing a fly with a bazooka i remember when tamiflu prices skyrocket because hn panic now viruses got resistent and tamiflu once effective against real diseases is  uselessncovid lockdownend remdesvir remdesevir
 not necessarily antivirals don't seem effective vs flu either unless you take them earlynntrials showing no effect have not been testing in early mild cases doing that would tell you tamiflu is useless too but obviously tamiflu is stockpiled
 tamiflu was hyped during  hn and the company pushed it by falsifying data it's basically uselessnna decade after approval an fda spokesp told the bmj trials failed to demon any sign diff in rates of hospitalization complic or mortalitynn
 so essentially this medication is just as useless as tamiflu if given early enough it eases symptoms and shortens the length of the illness imo
 from the folks who brought you the most useless antiviral drug in the universe tamiflu
 we know what your useless dream team did during  swine flu hn outbreak  people died despite having readily available medicine tamiflu (oseltamivir) govt was helpless while pharma companies exported large quantities creating shortage for indians  
 they need to treat  hydroxychloroquine like antiviral medicine (like the use of tamiflu on the onset of flu)nnthe problem is they have been testing hydroxychloroquine on critically ill patients at this point the virus already replicated enough to cause damage so it's useless
 we know what your useless dream team did during  swine flu hn outbreak  people died despite having readily available medicine tamiflu (oseltamivir) govt was helpless while pharma companies exported large quantities creating shortage for indians 
 do you remember utamifluu a roche (dick cheney) productnnit was foisted on us during avian flu despite no evidencennthe australian government lapped it up and donated millions in tamiflu as udevelopment assistanceu it was useless
 tamiflu essentially claiming it somehow didn't shorten the duration of the flu when administered late on that was then interpreted as the drug was useless truth is the drug is not only not useless but unless the virus has resistance the drug is very effective indeed 
 and in essence tamiflu is often useless
 only one answer xeni  tamiflunwe still have no idea how much was spent and what was done with the useless stocks countries bought in a hurry
 which antivirals? tamiflu? itus shown to do nothing itus useless and the flu vaccine is hit or miss and actually makes you more vulnerable to covid if you are high risk stay home
 difficult and they are skipping actually have entirely skipped animal trials antivirals are generally also not the most efficient drugs see for example so highly praised oseltamivir (tamiflu) many countries had to borrow money to buy tons of that useless junk  swine f
 testing is virtually useless nneven tamiflu has to be taken within  days of influenza infection 
 tamiflu is useless  if that's as good as it gets we're screwed
 is it uncommon for antivirals to be most effective given early? is it possible remdesivir and hcq actually appear to have worse efficacy due to trials in severe patients?nnthe only other antiviral i can really think of is tamiflu which i thought was useless if you wait  days
 treatment was initiated fairly lateuabout  to  days after disease onset by that timeline tamiflu is useless too
 makes sense tamiflu give early famvir give early  most antivrals if you give more than  hours after symptoms are useless
 not that simple according to this logic tamiflu for flu is also useless (as it does not work well late in infection) the point is that people need to see doctor much earlier get tested immediately and get a drugnot that only the sickest  people testedadmitted with a delay
 tamiflu is useless for me and one of my sons is allergic to it that stuff has never helped me
 i donut think a vaccine is a cureall how many people have taken the flue vaccineamp; still got it? if the virus mutates then the vaccine is useless if you get the flu tamiflu is usually prescribed if we continue to get positive results i think hydroxychloroquine for c best
 if you contract the flu within  days you can take tamiflu and stop it from multiplying trumps drug is useless unless you took it the day you were exposed too bad itus weeks before you know that itus been a ridiculous idea from the start wake up america drtrumpisanidiot 
 the man who consults for roche producing computer modelling that scares everybody and with him on the panel the who recommend tamiflu made by roche oh and the drug was basically useless

 its clear that he doesn't know that tamiflu is useless vs covid 
 a flu pandemic was the main scenario prepared for but this would have been a respiratory virus pandemic like covid so other than tamiflu stocks being useless against it  preparation would have helped if it had been done 
 tamiflu vaccine cost govt at the time u00a million and was useless they ended up giving it the year later as the winter flu jab to use up the stock this trial and production by big pharma will be the same one winner big pharma just look at their shares now
 tom jefferson of the cochrane collaboration in oxford england says that tamiflu (oseltamivir) is totally useless and that flu vaccines should be forced to go through clinical studies to prove that they are of only small benefitn
 of course they did in times past they produced the largely useless hn vaccines and tamiflu for hn but couldnut get the who to spread enough global panic to ensure mass scale distribution (profits) before the diseases blew themselves out this time around
 i remember my government spending a shedload of money on tamiflu during the swine flu pandemic it was absolutely useless in just about every regard but it was being pushed like hell here paracetamol probably would have been more effective
 i hate media people who think they know everything if in the future doctors use hydroxycloroquine like they use tamiflumaybe then you will stfu you act like you are a doctor who knows more than trump you are just a useless tool foxnews
 how is it that tamiflu our best weapon against noncov viral bugs effective only if administered within the first  hours of symptoms is a medical miracleyet hcqz if it doesn't raise the dead when administered  seconds before respiratory collapseis totally useless?
 sadly tamiflu is close to useless for exactly this reason
 tamiflu has a black box warning and only shortens the flu by a day or two not worth it in my opinion can cause psychosis how is this better than the flu ? our meds are mostly deadly and injurious the fda is useless 
 same as tamiflu that cost us u00a million and was bloody useless and we ended up giving it as the following yrs winter jab to get rid of the stock
 as it is written in articles from that time bju00frn olsen proposed to make own production for vaccine and criticized () for purchase of  lots of mostly useless tamiflu

  lices saved is success with no deathsnni think this is more than just a potionnnever hear of tamiflu? you have to take within  days of symptoma or useless zev found the same concept for covid
 australia spent the last  decades preparing for the wrong pandemic everyone thought influenza would mutate amp; reprise its  event we spent s of millions of dollars stockpiling useless tamiflu all the pandemic experts amp; plans are fixated on flu but covid isnut like flu
 and don't bother themselves with its poor results (or the fact that despite the cost to the nhs tamiflu amp; relenza are almost useless) i imagine that is the key  the world will rejoice when a vaccine is announced and freedom reigns
 did i say it was terrible or did i say the cdc projection on flu strain was incorrect rendering the tamiflu response as useless? remember they stopped production last year and had to switch to the correct version to produce that's happened twice in  years
 what guarantees do we have they didn't cause swineamp;bird flu to sell that useless drug tamiflu many countries had to take loans to buy loads of useless tamiflu  of profit went to rumsfeld 
 coz bill gates doesn't own it tom and although it's pretty effective and cheap govts would rather pay bigpharma hundreds of millions to pretend to create a vaccine i e tamiflu british govt spent u00a million the last time and it was proven useless hoax 
 a delay of days before symptoms appear after first infection? a  lack of effective drug (massive nhs stocks of tamiflu useless) a novel disease so fatalistically accepting the inevitability of being endemic in the long term not being the right response big difference to flu
  ucministers blew u00a million on useless antiflu drugsud a large studyinvestigated (tamiflu amp; relenza) it took into account new data that had previously been kept confidential by the drugsu manufacturers roche amp; glaxosmithklinen
  useless time to admit your mistake before the epidemic of fightslawsuitsada lawsuits etc   admit ityou blew this worse than you did with tamiflu
 youure not a doctor please do not suggest antibiotics useless against a virus or tamiflu this is not the flu and no one should be diagnosing themselves or getting medication suggestions from twitter
 tamiflu (oseltamivir) may have been slightly beneficial against the flu in the early days but flu viruses quickly evolved a strong resistance to that drug making it close to uselessn
 my family went down in early february  we are convinced it was covid   ( dr thought it was flu) when i thought it was flu i thought it was the worst flu since hong kong flu of n  ni took tamiflu (useless)nni took an anti viral which my sister had and that helped
 tamiflu another one cost the uk u00a million and was bloody useless they ended up using it for a winter flu jab to use up the stock only winners in this is bigpharma  and the rest 
 the first flu drug amantadine is basically useless now because all flu (well influenza a at least) is resistantnnincreasing resistance to tamiflu also
 sure does tamiflu vaccine cost uk nhs u00a million and it was bloody useless 
 contrary to  popular belief even the antivirals like tamiflu amp; relenza are largely useless (although very effective at swelling the coffers of the pharmaceutical giants) 
 iuve read reports saying itus pretty much uselessnmuch like tamiflu
 sounds very much like tamiflu except more useless since it's only available in iv form uddude 
 unless you get an emergency approval like with that probably useless tamiflu 0njust hope there a no unrecognized side effects
 very long but interesting thread about remdesivir  big pharma has not stopped being big pharma and looking for another tamiflu bonanza  high sales and profit on useless drug 
 my initial reaction to the gilead press release was that it sounded like tamiflu; ie basically useless
 why can't it be as useless as ribavirin for rsv? why must it always be tamiflu?
 anthony 'ucsounds like tamifluud  yes this is the same as tamiflu which also maybe shortens flu by a day but otherwise is a largely useless antiviral' strong thread
 surely thereus got to be a middle ground between ucremdesivir is a magic cureud and ucremdesivir is as useless as tamifluud
 itus worse than useless because people will come to hospital to get it thus spreading the virus further it happened with tamiflu
 useful detailed thread by one who knows  critics of stupid drugs that should never have been stockpiled by govts say ucsounds like tamifluud  yes this is the same as tamiflu which also maybe shortens flu by a day but otherwise is a largely useless antiviral 
 remdesivir 'ucsounds like tamifluud  yes this is the same as tamiflu which also maybe shortens flu by a day but otherwise is a largely useless antiviral' strong thread 
 now critics of stupid drugs that should never have been stockpiled by govts say ucsounds like tamifluud  yes this is the same as tamiflu which also maybe shortens flu by a day but otherwise is a largely useless antiviral (and actually harmful with bad side effect profile)
 tamiflu appears to be useless against the coronavirus unfortunately but one would have predicted that based on its mechanism of action as well
 will be as useless as tamiflu good thing the virus is so mild
 not unwarranted  much press is being given  gilead's price gouging  remdesivir tell ppl it's no more than a glorified tamiflu it may shorten the length of your illness it does not cure it must b administered wi the st  hrs of symptoms once on a ventilator it's useless 
 is it going to be useless like your tamiflu drug with fake research result ?
 i would hope not tamiflu is almost useless an effective drug for severe disease is worth  lousy drugs for anyseverity disease 
 reminds me of tamiflu government throwing money at a useless measuren
 early onset antivirals are mostly useless anyway the window of opportunity is so tiny  ever get tamiflu in time to make it actually work?
 are you not aware that the fdaapproved drug for flu tamiflu is useless if not given within the first  days of symptoms?  one could readily prove that it doesn't work by giving it to patients hospitalized with severe flu
 if covid ends up like flu we might never have an effective treatment people in their s and s can still end up in intensive care with flu and all we have for that is tamiflu which is pretty useless
 it is ineffective for patients well into the disease processnnthis is true for all drugsantivirals that are meant to disrupt viral replicationnnany frontline doctor knows that tamiflu is useless for influenza if not taken early  (same for the cyclovir drugs for hsvhzv)
 tamiflu isnut useless
 by analogy the fdaapproved antiflu drug tamiflu is only effective if given with  days of symptom onset  it would be useless in patients hospitalized with flu
 iud even go as far as to say that the health professionals who are refusing to administer this hcq cocktail are also to be labelled murderersnnthe fact that this idiot govt is ready to spend millions on useless vaccines proves theyuve learnt nothing from the tamiflu debacle
 tamiflu is useless without rapid test immediately after exposure just like hcq
 if gilead didn't have important friends in high places it should've been bankrupt remdesivir is a failed ebola drug being recycled for c and not only useless but damaging kidney  liver tamiflu ineffective hiv drug truvada beset by lawsuits

 masks should scare us all into not catching covid then killing others spreading it some vaccines are obviously effective but many are useless even dangerous  pharmaceutical companies are businesses in it to make profitnnso they'll prey on our fear of deathnntamiflu anyone?
 evaluation of this regimen in hospitalized patients totally misses the point  it's antiviral and therefore only works importantly in early disease  just like the approved antiflu drug tamiflu  tamiflu could be proved to be useless by testing it in hospitalized flu patients
 your department once championed amp; wasted millions of taxpayer's money buying a useless and dangerous tamiflu vaccine it caused neurological damage and had to be withdrawn fact not antivax you think people will expose themselves on your pompous assurances?
 the only winners regarding this so called vaccine mike will be big pharma remember tamiflu for the swine flu it cost the govt u00a million pounds and was useless they ended up giving it for the seasonal flu the year after just to get rid of the stock
 in other words this study is completely useless as no one with half a mind expected hcq to work d into the disease no one expects tamiflu or xofluza or any antiviral for that matter to have efficacy d into sx onset completely useless once again so thank them udeudd
 my understanding of hcq is its like tamiflu youuve gotta hit it early at the initial symptoms itus useless once ucfull bloomud infection begins it also should be mixed with zinc and possibly a zpack to be more effective hcq shouldnut be a hailmary or used once hospitalized
 that is an ignorant statement  look at any antiviral (for example tamiflu)   they are generally most effective in early stages and useless in late stages of disease
 very early but even at  it will knock this down a bit then you have the drug cocktails to hit it more  i found out how useless tamiflu was a few years ago
 claiming that  billion would be affected worldwide with k deaths in the uk panicked govts then rushed to buy the largely useless (and in some cases dangerous) relenza amp; tamiflu from cso vallance's former employers amp; hoffman laroche
 cso vallance actually came to the civil service straight from the board of glaxosmithkline given your background i assume you already know that gsk  amp; hoffman laroche made a killing selling panicked governments largely useless vaccines and the antivirals tamiflu amp; relenza
 do we know that it works?ngood chance this is as useful (readuuseless) as tamifluugileadus other antiviral
 yes but for the pharmaceutical industry trial data are not useless nmy worry is that due to lobbying of governments and fear in the public we have again seen the billion dollars coffers opening for products which the governments might as well use n
 i think you are writing in precovid mode the trauma in sourcing equipment etc the lack of solidarity shown by the eu to its fellow countries should drive the uk to prioritize expansion of its manufacturing the stock pile of tamiflu was useless
 i have not seen an rct which uses the early hcq protocol recommended by frontline doctors who claim success  tamiflu would also prove useless in an rct depending on timing  i'm more interested in ivermectin  what do you think of this?  
 not everyone takes a flu shot and if you donut start tamiflu immediately itus useless still it kills people
 using ppl as lab rats and an excuse to buyselluse drugs make money for hospitals and pharma industry remember tamiflu many country probably still have to repay loans for tamiflu which was not only completely useless drug but also has serious side effects
 yeah except many of the studies focused on patients already on ventilators many of the studies did not monitor zinc or use azithromycin thereus nothing more useless than a poorly designed study if i followed the study protocols they used for hcq i could prove tamiflu useless
 the last time big pharma took the uk taxpayers to the cleaners it was those millions of useless unused doses of tamiflu for swine flu another grossly infalted death figure from neil furguson
 because they're doubling down several studies have come out that shows that that drug works very well if you get it in the system early like tamiflu but if you don't then it's useless but because trump said it could work they want to make sure you think it doesn't
 the last time i had the flu i asked my doctor for tamiflunshe asked me when my symptoms started i said  or  days ago she said it won't help after  hoursnwhy does an apparently similar quality make hcq useless?
 there are rapid tests that take lt;hr why test at all? the student will have a mild cold for a few days and be fine same for flu if you have ili symptoms you are sick a flu test won't change treatment unless you prescribe useless tamiflu
 tamiflu decrease severity and duration of the flu by  nnthe point is if they only tested tamiflu in patients with symptomsgt; h we'd say that it was useless  nnpoint being hcq warrants further testing early to see if it has a similar window
   indonesia starts a participant clinical trial testing tamiflu (oseltamivir) which is useless for covid against avigan (favipiravir) this study will not reach statistical significance because endstage covid victims will be includedn
 the fdaapproved antiflu drug tamiflu is useless if treatment is initiated after more than  days of symptoms  antiviral agents only work if given early  advocates of hcqazmzn insist it must be given with  days of symptom onset the earlier the better
 the fact that a vaccine is being held out as only solution stinks for me swine flu pandemic was more or less invented to sell tamiflu and pandemrix both of which were useless
 same here the one time i had it courtesy of one of my students i was miserable got to the urgent care with u00b0 temp dr gave me tamiflu and i was back teaching in  days doc said a shot would have been useless against the strain i had i'm only concerned bc of covid
 doctors make me sicker i just inform myself amp; decide what's best for meni had the flu amp; knew i had the flu not a cold (not sneezing)nwent to doctor hoping for tamiflunhad  fevernmd said i had a cold gave me useless antibiotic i never went backnthanks for caring though
 useless drug that is still raking in billions? just like tamiflu a couple of years ago?nnthey did a capitalism on us again those rascals udeudddnn
 i'm a pharmacist and i'll be reading the data extremely carefully before getting anything the uk govt listened to crap advice during swine flu and ordered  million vaccines (enough for two doses for every person) and pandremix and tamiflu are both useless but rushed through
 tamiflu has been proven uselessso not sure why they included that
 pep press conferences are as useless as tamiflunfpl 
 like tamiflu purchase for useless drug 
 remdesivir is in the same family as oseltamivir (tamiflu); the later is the most useless piece of shit drug ever approved by the fda seeamong many othern
 that study doesn't actually prove it's useless  it only proves it useless on people who are already hospitalized  but it's common for antivirals to only be useful when given early; tamiflu is like that for instancennnot that this makes fauci look any better
 there won't be any vaccine any time soon and when they do come out with one or a few itthey will work just as bad as the seasonal flu shot but they will sell like hot dogs udeudda0 udcudfdnnwhich is the point remember hn swine flu and roche's useless tamiflu? same thing
 dr's should know that antivirals are useless unless given early ( tamiflu ) yet many waited till patients were hospitalized or in icu

 that's not how vaccines work vaccines get your immune system prepared to combat a virus so that you don't have a deadly infection from it it's useless once you have been infected  it's why you don't get a flu shot when you get the flu you get tamiflu
  a mononclonal antibody  most effective treatment for ebolan tamiflu (for flu) is used effectively as prophylaxis for those known to have been exposed testing positive in ltc amp; outbreaks  n this drug is cheaper than treating full blown covidn this drug u useless 
 a bit like tamiflu being dished out like candy during the swine flu 'epidemic' in  which was lucky as they went out of date that year so just in time to order another u00am  worth despite it being pretty much useless 
 gilead sciences head of board use to be donald rumsfeldnnduring the swine flu pandemic they were literally given billions of dollars for tamiflu some shit designed for avian flu that wouldnt even be effective nnstop giving them gov contracts they are useless
 who remembers tamiflu? nyou're wasting our money on useless crap thanks
 we spent s of millions on a useless tamiflu drug for swine flu pharma has a lot of form for ripping us off
 yes you are so right all those prescribed drugs that the drug companies know  don't work; the billions spent on useless tamiflu around the world; the k adverse drug reactions hidden by roche 
 some clown on said of the coronavaccine we can trust the people who recommend it really? the same companies amp; 'experts' who told us that 'tamiflu' vaccine was effective and safe? a 'treatment' that inflicted neurological damage and proved useless
 whats the odds that after a few wks of rolling out this magic vaccine the number of negative tests starts increasing absolute miracle doesn't anybody remember the magic vaccine tamiflu i would imagine if this superflu mutates again it will b useless
 many treatments (which are largely unnecessary like remdesivir) require iv use and hospitalization remdesivir is the tamiflu of covid minimal reduction in duration largely useless drug nncalifornia was due for a peak and i'm so tired of hearing this was from noncompliance
 hey dr tamiflu or is it dr remdesivir now both equally useless but immensely profitable
 remember donald rumsfeld and tamifluit was useless but he made millionsn
 no tamiflu is useless like remdesivir
 politicians let lobbyists talk them into stocking useless medications like tamiflu instead of ppe we could have had fewer deaths and fewer shutdowns if politicians hadnut sold us out before the pandemic
 weuve had useless uddudcatamiflu and relenza   antiviral drugs waste of money  now multidose pfizercovidvaccine uddudeuddude covidvaccine
 i've always thought it was a waste of time and money to test for flu at all if a pt presents with ili in the er  what difference does it make? they are just as sick regardless of what's causing it and the treatment is largely the same unless you bother with useless tamiflu
 hcq could potentially be good but you have to use it very early on in infection like tamiflu if you donut get it early itus useless
