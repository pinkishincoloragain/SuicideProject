 i know someone who tried zyban and it made them suicidal
 so people call wellbutrin wellbloatrin bc weight gain is a common side effect and like it isn't ideal but i would rather have a tummy than suicidal tendencies
 i should say that the suicidal thoughts went away while i was on zoloftwellbutrin the first time not that it got rid of them i have no idea if it actually caused them to go away especially since they didn't when i was on it the second time

 hot reminder the suicide hotline is an important resource but an even more valuable is just telling people that youure glad theyure in your life and that you get to know them also wellbutrin

 was just thinking does anyone think it's not a coincidence that certain drugs ie ssri's such as wellbutrin lexapro or even chantix has a side effect of may cause suicidal thoughts??
 i became suicidal with wellbutrin  my pain management dr wants me to get off of one of my meds complained to my lawyer and she said oh maybe you should be off of them after many years i finally found the right combination  people certainly donut understand

 wellbutrin is used for bpd sometimes it didn't have side effects that were too bad for me forum comment said had a problem with overstimulated panic attack  i strongly discourage olanzapine suicidal withdrawal amp; weight gain amp; diabetes risk on it

 i didn't lose the weight until i was ) diagnosed with severe clinical depression; ) put on wellbutrin; and ) treated with love amp; respect in a bariatric clinic by a doctor nutritionist amp; counselor i was selfmedicating to prevent suicide how would ridiculing me have helped?
 um not for me and i have been on zoloft wellbutrin  paxil prozaci find that i actually feel more depressed and can get suicidally (bad thoughts) depressed on them they can also make you manic if u r bipolar exercise yoga meditation reading painting fam time  better
 there are lots of antidepressants out there i tried a half dozen before i found one that worked without sideaffects nitus why i mentioned wellbutrin one of its side effects is anxiety and suicidal thoughts???n weeks is long enough call your doc
 same adverse effects as wellbutrin or zyban (same med) dizzinessdrowsinessslight risk of increased suicidal ideation
 so is celexa (citalopram) wellbutrin (buproprion) and cymbalta (dulouxetine) all safer with fewer side effects alcohol is a definite no no occasionally a night out is okay but regular drinking will make the sue effects more prevalent amp; extreme amp; may cause suicidal ideology
 cw suicidennviewing pharmaceutical drugs for mental illness as a crutch directly contributed to my brothers death he was suicidal and c and i helped him go on wellbutrin not even a month after his nadir my dad was talking to him about not staying on it too long 
 the trialanderror part is so trying paxil made me suicidal prozac made me hate sex wellbutrin did exactly nothing zoloft seems to do the trick partly but only with lamictal trazodone was nice when i was having trouble sleeping amp; atarax is helpful for both that and hives

 i tried to kill myself and someone stopped me by accident then i admitted myself because thatus what my old psychiatrist said to do if i ever became acutely suicidal i should admit myself i am still on wellbutrin
 wellbutrin basically got rid of my depression and intrusive suicidal thoughts it feels like a miracle sometimes but being inpatient psych was basically high octane nightmare fuel
 i had no access to tech to double check amp; was drained but in two days i was crawling out of my skin with fullon mania i was suicidal (still inpatient thank stars) in common room another patient mentioned wellbutrin amp; effexor being basically the same tw suicide
 when i checked into the the hospital navigating severe ideation amp; depression i had the autopilot presence of mind to tell the psychiatrist i can't take any snri medication because they make me have thoughts of suicide and selfharm she put me on wellbutrin an snrissri
 i'm on lamictal which flattens my excitement about things but also removes suicidal thoughts but i cycle between very depressed and a bit depressed hence zoloft glad to hear you're better wellbutrin is next on my list if zoloft doesn't work
 same adverse effects as wellbutrin or zyban (same med) dizzinessdrowsinessslight risk of increased suicidal ideation

 wellbutrin not only gave me suicidal thoughts (actually i was hearing a voice) it made me start smoking cigarettes after  years quit picked them up like i'd never quitnquacks wanted a stronger ssri surely didn't report the adverse event to fda
 can you explain why  cases of lung injury with  deaths is a crisis that requires a ban of an unrelated item but more than  suicides with either wellbutrin or chantix is an acceptable risk? 
 do you think chantixwellbutrin's suicides count towards their successful quit rates? technically you wouldn't be smoking any more
 nobody is that clueless to think limiting flavors won't make ecigs less effective let alone think tobacco flavor won't do exactly what they claim they want to avoid (training wheels for kids)nni've wondered if they counted suicides towards chantixwellbutrin's success rates
  illegal thc lung cases nmore than  chantixwellbutrin suicides where's the epidemic for that?ncorporate protection just like using illegal thc as an excuse to ban ecigs to protect big tobaccona govt of the corporations for the corporations owned by the corporations
 fda approved nrt wellbutrinsuicidal thoughts chantaxconvulsions gummouth soresnpatchhivesnthe above were my reactions i smoked for  years i quit with caramel cookie tobacco flavor sucks more questions? ask me
 i would have guessed wellbutrin  klonopin is addictive and can lead to thoughts of suicide
 i take effexor and wellbutrin amp; help me massively off meds ium lethargic irritable (more) extreme mood swings sleep  hrs at a time amp; am suicidally depressednnthe side effects i experience r dry mouth weight loss appetite loss hand tremors amp; a baseline of mild anxiety
 antidepressants story last time i took wellbutrin (bupropion) it didn't improve my mood at all nor reduce my suicidal thoughts it did however consistently keep me awake for  hours at a time despite being on another sedative even amphetamine doesn't do this to me
 yesterdayfirst day off prozacwellbutrin sad sad sad sad sad obsessed self depreciation suicidal ideations pushing others away back on my old self harming tendencies crying anger etcnntodayfirst day on zoloft no effects yet just trying to wait amp; see what happens
 pop another wellbutrin to stave off the suicidal thoughts they'll be coming in soon once you dont have somebody to put down and betlittle
 i was diagnosed w depression suicidal ideation anxiety tried wellbutrin among other meds amp; yes i tried jesus and yet jesus did not remove my depression amp; other issues ni had to figure a way out on my own nwhat works for you may not work for othersnjarridwilson
 wellbutrin helped me with my anxiety but it made my depression a lot worse and also extremely irritable cymbalta made me suicidal and completely unable to sleep and constantly on the verge of tears
 yes antidepressants can cause unintended symptoms like hypomania nn nnsuicideprevention depressionandme depressionanxietyandme depression depressed manic hypomanic hypomania mania mentalhealth mentalillness
 fyi you have to respect whatever float peoples boat  by the way i almost die with the wellbutrin hives and as ium sure you know the are more than a  reported cases or wellbutrin related deaths  liver failure and suicide  
 thankful for my husband who spends every moment by my side to remind me that i am still supposed to be here and thankful for wellbutrin for making my brain stop lying to me worldsuicidepreventionday fuckcancer notdeadyet 
 i take wellbutrin amp; prozac and i honestly have no idea how they are working but i donut have suicidal ideations so thatus good wellbutrin did make my body feel crazy for the first  weeks i took it i was very dizzy and had to spend most of my days lying down
 i was  years old just a kid with a crazy dream since then iuve taken a lot of prozac paxil wellbutrin effexor ritalin focalin iuve also studied deeply in the philosophies of the religions but cheerfulness kept breaking throughudnleonard cohennsuicidepreventionday 
  selling their ass to get another dose of wellbutrinnni do know that things like exercisenutrition can affect a person wdepression in some ways some times for some people but itus useless for the kind of cyclically suicidal depression that i have amp; that runs in my family
 well gabapentin made me suicidal and wellbutrin is an antidepressant that they used to use to stop smoking not very good antidepressant either
 the day i die will probably be the day i run out of wellbutrin and lamictal or at least within the week because without my meds iull have a mixed episode (not sure what they call it now dysphoric mania?) and that leads directly to suicide or an accidental heroin overdose
 wellbutrin took me from depressed to uncontrollably crying and suicidal nantidepressants are tricky nmassive amounts of effexor was the only thing that was kinda good for me but had withdrawals when i ran out
 can confirm prozac and wellbutrin taken together was great for me eventually prozac started making me suicidal so i was switched to zoloft (which i love) but wellbutrin helped a lot with energy levels throughout the day talk to your dr about taking both
 yesna friend of mine just went through this it was bad nprozac is a serotonin reuptake inhibitor wellbutrin doesn't do jack shit for serotonin so if you're not careful you could  basically fall off a serotonin cliff amp; end up depressed amp; suicidal like my friend 
 obviously everyone's experience is different but i just want to point out that  chantix doesn't appear to increase suicidal thoughts and  i had a really wonder experience (and still am) on bupropion (zyban) but i took it for depression rather than smoking cessation
 ium a pgy on wellbutrin since ms when i was so depressed i couldnut eat or sleep lost lbs and casually considered suicide as less shameful than dropping out now ium on wellbutrin mg do therapy and love my work but ainut gonna literally kill myself for it udeudduduufe0fuddude0
 i was put on wellbutrin and instead of it helping i started getting worse anxiety suicidal thoughts and my depression was worse i had to call my dr over the phone to prescribe me something else ium on lexapro now and everything is a lot better
 iuve been on about  dif antidepressants over the last  years effexor and wellbutrin work best for me iuve been on trintellix which caused me severe nausea and cipralex which made me increasingly suicidal and lethargic every person reacts differently to each med tho
 wellbutrin helped me a lot after my miscarriage nthey gave me cymbalta now and it helped with severe suicidal thoughts which i guess is a pro but it leaves me unable to feel any emotions
 cn suicidal ideationsnni don't know how to tell if the wellbutrin is harmful or if it's not enough or if i'm just having a surge of bad emotions finding myself not wanting to be alive today thinking of ways to die who i'd leave things to i won't do it  bc of my spouse
 do be careful though i was on wellbutrin briefly and found that i was one of those unfortunates who react very badly to it and ended up having to call a suicide hotline
 thanks to wellbutrin i am not depressed it's just anxiety suicidal
 wellbutrin made me have suicidal thoughts and i ended up in the hospital getting tests ran for half a day only thing that helps is zoloft
 i figured it out my psych doubled my wellbutrin after i was suicidal last week amp; it's giving me some super fucked up side effectsnnhallelujah nni wish sanity was as simple as just popping a pill as the ignorant believe 
  during one of my bouts with depression i was put in wellbutrin and experienced suicidal thoughts as a side effect i got through that time obviously but  those moments stick with me i clearly recall it worldmentalhealthday
 last year i was on klonopin and ativan for mild anxiety and wellbutrin for depression i was hysterical and suicidal i'm glad i stopped taking them
 i have been on wellbutrin for seven years now and should have been on something from the age of seven when i first contemplated suicide i am  now and am finally able to function and relish life
 i smoked for  years  i empathize with his plight everything you listed above i tried but didn't work for me chantix and wellbutrin? suicidal thoughts; cold turkey? violently sick acupuncture? smoked more fortunately i woke up one morning and decided i didn't want to get
 f chantix  it didn't stop me from smoking amp; gave me sporadic insomnia amp; depression nni'm glad you're still herennmay   july  chantix was linked to approximately  suicides  suicide attempts and almost 000 serious psychiatric eventsnn
 i feel the exact same way iuve been on zoloft amp; nadolol since   wellbutrin since  my aunt committed suicide after she changed her meds so ium absolutely horrified to even taper one of my meds
 i tried a bunch of ssrius snris and wellbutrinevery single one of them made me suicidal and a few gave me insane side effects make sure you talk to your doctor right away if you experience any of that ium now just in anti anxiety meds because it was our last resort
 hi i'm janice and i have major depressive disorder and anxiety that i take meds for and i have lupus adding wellbutrin to my psych meds stopped my constant and unwanted suicidal ideation i'm a nurse and ending stigmas around mental illness is so important
 wellbutrin gave me intense suicidal thoughts that i had never had before these medications work differently for everybody and often times take several attempts to find the best one
 i was suicidal most of my life from the age of  when i was molested i have been on wellbutrin since the last of my family passed away  years ago i am the healthiest iuve ever been emotionally anyway at 
 i went to obsessing about suicide she sent me to a nurse practitioner who put me on wellbutrin fortunate was i that it worked on my depression i got out of the well but then the most extraordinary thing started happening about  weeks down the road 
 so lexapro killed my sex drive i gained weight and was more suicidal  wellbutrin is also used as an appetite suppressant for binge eating disorder so didnut have any weight gain mu sex drive came back amp; it has stimulant properties to make me feel more ucenergizedud or whatever
 looking for investors for my uchighest suicide rate of the year advent calendarud every day is a wellbutrin pill but each week the dosage is upped
 wellbutrin is like one is the only ones that doesnut fuck with your sex life but one of the main side effects is suicidal thoughts uddude0udeudd
 i noticed i became more violent when put on wellbutrin i was  i think we need to look at underlying causes a little harder i wasn't bipolar i was a rape and suicide survivor who endured extreme abuse
 let's tweet the warnings in the packet here's wellbutrin xl (bupropion) antidepressants increased the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in shortterm studies in children and adolescents with major depressive disorder (mdd) and other psychiatric disorders
 wait he didnut taper your antidepressants? going off of some of those (like wellbutrin) can literally kill you either by giving you seizures or suddenly increasing your depression symptoms amp; causing you to have suicidal thoughtsactions ium glad you found resources but sheesh
 wellbutrin had no sexual side effects but about a month into it i had a breakdown which included aural amp; visual hallucinations paranoid amp; suicidal thoughts
 yrs ago was on wellbutrin  help quit uddudeac at st i felt more calm then suicidal thoughts crept in(wanted  crash my uddude)was on paxil for a short time amp; that  gave me the i don't give a crap what i said amp; whose feelings i  more rx drugs
   to  veterans at vha without a diagnosis who got mh treatment (ie prescribed antidepressant wellbutrin for smoking cessation) were more likely to die by suicide than those with a diagnosis who were ucuntreatedud 
 chantix is initially  but has a risk of suicide (i had a suicidal voice in my head with wellbutrinzyban) the pills have a high initial rate but it's longer term than the approval studies that they all fall i think chantix is  at  months
 switching to wellbutrin today i'll let y'all know if this one makes me have suicidal ideation too lol
 yes lexapro and wellbutrin xl have helped immensely i donut have panic attacks anymore my other physical symptoms are under control like the bad muscle tension and the insomnia i no longer fantasize about suicide or sleep most of the day i no longer feel like
 wellbutrin can take a while feels like a weird choice after ritalin but ium not a doctor it has the risk of really severe stuff so let someone know asap if ur like getting strong suicidal ideationu but other than that itull take a while to feel things
 this has helped me more than zoloft wellbutrin and all the other anti depressants i have been prescribed there is no contraindications for suicide with marijuana unlike all antidepression medications 
 and that was  years ago imagine how much more there is now i know for a fact that there were  more suicides due to champixzyban
 lets not forget chantix and zyban to help us smokers quit the list of side effects on that stuff scary my doc said nope i will not give it to you  suicidal thoughts sexual dysfunction 
 i tried chantix x  result was weird dreams depression loss of concentration and suicidal thoughts tried welbutrin  same result  zyban was not effective cold turkey didn't workpatch gave me headaches from too much nicotine vaping only thing worked for me immediately
 chantix is initially  but has a risk of suicide (i had a suicidal voice in my head with wellbutrinzyban) the pills have a high initial rate but it's longer term than the approval studies that they all fall i think chantix is  at  months
 know that there will be a percentage of placebo in play with those who want to quit by any methodthey believe yet fda methods still have high failures ecigs like chantix and zyban get people who don't want to quit to quit but ecigs do it without the side effect of suicide
 i didnut know if it was some type of allergic reaction or just what occured  wellbutrin is known to cause suicidal tendencies in some pts  i again hav no idea what her circumstances were though  uddudcrip
 i heard good things about the med but for me i started on wellbutrin few weeks ago and recently ended up going to the er because i had sudden emotional crash that lead me to suicidal ideation and extreme depression as a side effect so i would say it is different for everyone
 hi i also had these issues on wellbutrin and i also experienced suicidal thoughts i have felt much better since getting off it not all medications work for everyone
 the consumption of alcohol during treatment with bupropion (wellbutrin xl) should be minimized or avoided due to side effects like seizures hallucinations delusions paranoia mood and behavioral changes depression suicidal thoughts anxiety and panic attacks
 another a week in i felt closer to a suicide attempt than i had in a long time took myself to the hospital instead i was told that this happens with wellbutrin u a lot of depressed people feel suicidal but depression saps energy wellbutrin gives you energy back first
 they're how i quit smoking cigarettes  years ago every craving i ate a clementine worked even better than the wellbutrin i had tried to quit on before amp; the clementines didn't give me suicidal thoughts though those little crates piled up fast you can't recycle them eh?
 man i tried lexapro before my psychiatrist started me on the xl wellbutrin  night and day difference that shit made me more actively suicidal than not even being medicated w wellbutrin when i donut take it i can definitely see changes uddude0
 not to be dramatic but wellbutrin saves my life everyday uddude0 we arenut suicidal on it i mean do i wanna life? nah i couldnut care less but hey at least ium not trying to die udeuddudcudffbuduufe0f
 wellbutrin is good my dr told me there were no side effects but i did my own research and that's not true look them up and talk to yr dr about them twnnnnnnthe big one is an increased risk of suicidal ideation
 wellbutrin made me quite insane anxiety through the roof suicidal thoughts irrational behavior i couldnut stay on it; sounds much less bad for you though

 wellbutrin made me suicidal (
 wellbutrin gt; zybannnthey figured out that poison wellbutrin curbed nicotine addiction nnpeople diddo not even know zyban is an antidepressant with suicidal tendencies nnfuck pharma
 the combination of wellbutrin and strattera gave me horrible mood swings and emotionalphysical pain and later suicidality the trauma of it is probably permanent i don't think i'll ever recover i don't know if it damaged my brain permanently
 you should know there's a risk of suicidal ideation with it especially if you've ever had similar medications (like prozac wellbutrin topamax etc) and had ideations with them many doctors don't even know so it's worth mentioning just in case
 its gotten to the point where whenever i get a weird nervous system thing i google it an  of the time its a side effect of fuckin wellbutrin like im not gonna get off of it bc i like not being constantly suicidal but jesus
 well wellbutrin had me spiraling demolishing all my friendships and attempting suicide then i found lexapro my whole life has changed my whole life
 i had bad side effects which added up to me not feeling despondent or suicidal but also not feeling much else  wellbutrin was added to my prescription but i found it had no major effectnneventually i figured another psychiatrist was needed to reevaluate me 
 heus right though have you not seen the suicide rate in this country? did you know that wellbutrin one of the more commonly tolerated antidepressants cost month for middle dose and  for higher dose? duh americans are miserable

 wellbutrin gt; zybannnthey figured out that poison wellbutrin curbed nicotine addiction nnpeople diddo not even know zyban is an antidepressant with suicidal tendencies nnfuck pharma
 iuve heard that a lot but zoloft is the only ssri that truly works for me prozac put my ass on suicide watch and iuve tried other shit like wellbutrin and i turned into a fucking suicidal ideation zombie lmao
 i have taken many medications that people usually get suicidal thoughts from (gabentapin wellbutrin prozac escitalopram clonodine etc) with no problems but adderall melatonin supplements and vicodin of all things destroy my will to exist very quickly udeudd
 so nquestionnnlast year my psychiatrist started me on wellbutrin a popular antidepressant nnwithin a month or so i was suicidal for the first time in my life given the con it was jarring but not tooooo surprising nnappts with psych went as usual no change in script
 im not a psychiatrist but ive tried  psychiatric meds and the top  i would choose arenlexapronwellbutrinnlatuda (why hasnt anyone mentioned this one?)nvyvansenbuspar nif it was fda approved a take home ketamine nasal spray works excellent for suicidal thoughts
 ah i stopped taking wellbutrin because it was making me really suicidal so ig we'll see how this goes
 everyone is different lol wellbutrin made me homicidal and lexapro made me suicidal u i can refer u to my psychopharmacologist she rocks
 i was in my worst depressive episode when i found meds that worked for me i did trintellix which made me so nauseous cipralex which somehow made me more suicidal than i already was it was a relief to get off that one to effexor which ium still on along with wellbutrin
 i got really sick with dilaudid amp; it didnut even touch the pain same with tramadol wellbutrin made me more suicidal
 i started w just prozac and it was awful suicidal voices no sex drive etc my dr boosted it with wellbutrin and within a week i was feeling so so much better
 wellbutrin amplified my suicidal thoughts tendencies so badly i remember doing the dishes one night and thinking ucwhat if i just run this steak knife through my wristsud i really hope no one has a similar reaction to it bc they saw it on tik tok 
 ium allergic to lexapro and wellbutrin made me super psycho and suicidal right now ium on prozac it helps some with my depression not so much for anxiety so i take xanax as needed for that annnnnnnnd there my sex drive is still very much alive
  didnut i write ium very allergic  it amp; yes u can become suicidal i read all meds carefully before taking in case i feel weird i have had other very bad reactions to other meds wellbutrin is zayban just diff name terrible pill
 i was on lexapro and it made me more suicidaldepressed than ever i found some peace with wellbutrin obviously everyoneus different i hope you find what works for you uddudcfuddudcf
 anxiety set in first then depression then suicidal fantasies tried  antidepressants ssris snri wellbutrin various others benzos all adhd meds they all either made things worse or helped for a few months then made things worse
 lexapro gave me the mad shakes and wellbutrin made me suicidal yaaay
 my favorite personal story about this was when i needed a new prescription for prozac the insurance company said i had to try celexa and wellbutrin first i said ucso celexa quit working after  years and wellbutrin made me manic and suicidal so ium gonna have to say noud 
 stick with it how many mgsday? i do it in combo w buspar wellbutrin and cymbalta; that seems to finally work for me personally but it took a few yrs of trying different stuff to get to a good place never quit without dr supervision; thatus a ticket to udcudfe or suicide
 they have come a long way back in the 's my psychologist at the mental hospital (i checked myself in because i was suicidal) had me on different ones when released i was on prozac for a half year then wellbutrin
 wellbutrin just makes me not sleep and limits suicidal thoughts but other ppl say to me it's like coke with rails on it for them
 yes iuve been on wellbutrin and effexor  wellbutrin gave me anxiety attacks effexor did not help and i think increased my suicidal ideation  my doctor has even told me that ssris donut work for me
 iuve taken it didnut work ( at least it didnt make me suicidal like other ones did (thanks cymbalta) i went from  to  wellbutrin and ium stressed and anxious and have shakestremors but iull calm down in a few weeks hopefully
 my biggest flex in high school was hiding my mental illness everyday i took wellbutrin prozac and clonidine i saw a psychologist monthly and a psychiatrist weekly went through multiple suicide attempts and showed up to school the next day sometimes i wonder how i graduated
 wellbutrin literally increased my suicidal tendencies and made me unbearably angry i took it for maybe a month and had to stop because it just literally tossed me into and even deeper depressive episode ni take citolopram now and i have no issues with it
 reading wellbutrin stories and they seem to err onnn become strong and motivated enough to kill god but have 0 sex drivennornn be immensely horny but also suicidal
 reading wellbutrin stories and they same to err onnn become strong and motivated enough to kill god but have 0 sex drivennornn be immensely horny but also suicidal
 i'm not sure i've tried loads of different meds and they either make me super sick suicidal or they just stop working right now i'm on lamictal and wellbutrin neither of those are helping with my anxiety though
 wellbutrin was a major contributing factor in my suicide attempt
 i used to be overly empathetic  i have been hospitalized as a suicide risk twice  now life is wonderful and it is due to wellbutrin

 tbh anything is better than taking tamiflu side effects are ridiculous(hallucinations suicidal thoughts) like i already suffer from depression so letus add that on top of being sicklike nah ium good

 uca teen commits suicide after taking a prescribed and highly recommended flu medication called tamiflu reports of children and teens suffering from hallucinations and psychotic episodes after taking tamiflu is on the riseudnn
 i have many friends and family in the medical field the vast majority of them agree that tamiflu has too many dangerous side effects for it to be 'safely' given to children a friend's child tried to commit suicide while taking it because he was having grotesque hallucinations
 true but it also means not spreading hurtful propaganda i personally know two adults with no history of mental illness who took tamiflu and started hearing voices had suicidal thoughts amp; severe depression that drug is very scary
 tamiflu warning in japan after child suicides and injuries  science  the guardian 
 lowkey i can understand the mom being skeptical of tamiflu bc of the fact that they pulled that shit like a year ago bc of kids having suicidal thoughts however she shoulduve just got a second opinion them babies were having seizures they needed medical attention
 i knew a pharmacist by association who was happy married with kids peachy took tamiflu  had no prior mental health issues  chained himself up in his basement and committed suicide
 i agree  but also wanna add tamiflu does not directly treat the flu virus and is not necessary to take when diagnosed tamiflu has also been found to show neurological changes  specifically suicidal thoughtsideation in short donut doubt doctors but also trust your body 
 and i just discovered it is banned for teens in japan due to suicides and injuries from the psychiatric side effects it can cause but we donut acknowledge those here 
 people are weary of the big pharma and i do believe there has been a plethora of holistic doctors being suicided

 fyi tamiflu may reduce the length of  flu by  day it is a medicine not a vacinne parents have reservations about the drugs psychiatric sideeffects on warning label amp; suicide 
 tamiflu is not a vaccine it is a newer drug taken daily that can reduce the length of symptoms by one day i just went to the doctor for the flu i took xofluza instead as many people especially young people experience severe psychiatric problems on tamiflu and commit suicide
 two boys one  and one  jumped from the secondstory windows of their homes after receiving  doses of tamiflu those boys survived but news reports have told of two teenagers taking tamiflu whose death may be attributable to suicide
 uhm i didn't say it can't help it's just not some miracle drug that instantly saves your life everyone knows tamiflu is known for causing psychosis it even says it on the insert on the box so many kids have committed suicide while on it it's not new information udeudduduufe0f
 a few teens with underlying untreated mental disorders became suicidal while on tamiflu  my doctor explained that is the reason for that warning
 tamiflu only claims that it may shorten the time of infection by  days it's not some miracle drug it also just killed a teen recently who had the psychosis symptoms that everyone worries about with tamiflu and she committed suicide either way this is a tragedy
 so who is responsible for all of the kidsteens who have hallucinations and commit suicide following tamiflu? itus just a coincidence right?

 two years ago macy (age  months) and i both were diagnosed with flu a we both took tamiflu and neither of us hallucinated or became suicidal thatus all
 because opus thread had a point about tamiflu iud like to point out that tamiflu () is not a cure for flu () does not (statistically speaking) significantly reduce the duration of flu symptoms and () can cause psychotic side effects including suicide
 which by the wayhas its own set of side effectsincluding psychosismany documented suicide attempts and self injury related to z pack and tamiflu use yet where is the outrage?
 like tamiflu whose side effects are way worse than the flu? and all the depression meds that warn that it may cause suicidal thoughts?
 it may sound reasonable but it is not tamiflu causes delusions hallucinations suicide and psychosis with potentially such serious adverse side effects it should have an fda warning but it does notn
 you cannot catch cancer from your students you can get a flu shot and take tamiflu  you can avoid accidents by wearing seat belts and teachers donut generally commit suicide it is not the flu prayfornick
 and covid we should take the covid as seriously as we do the flu which has a vaccine that many of us get so letus imagine the flu but no one has any immunity and there is no vaccine or tamiflu weud freak out and we need to consider it and as seriously as suicide 
 tamiflu is pure evil you're right on the side effects my daughter and i both experienced anxiety and nightmares after less than half the prescribed course we were lucky a good friend had severe anxiety and suicidal thoughts for several weeks until it cleared her system
 plus tamiflu literally can make people suicidal japan pulled it off of their recommended medications list for that reason teens and young adults are the ones that usually donut do well i didnut get suicidal but i was in a bad mental place w it
