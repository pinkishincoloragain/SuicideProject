 hey adhd peeps that take bupropion (like wellbutrin) i have some questions nndo yall take it alone or together with stimulants? are you more on the ph or pi side? neurodiversesquad askadhd
 i actually liked it i was taking it with birth control tho at first so it felt like nothing but i was taking just wellbutrin alone for a month and i think i was sane
 ok so ium convinced my wellbutrin made my into an affectionattention starved bitch cause right now ium more content that iuve been in months alone with my own thoughts
 you are not alone  i had my doctor ramp up my wellbutrin dosage

 iuve not been on zoloft but iuve been on prozac wellbutrin cipralex and remeron and have done copious amounts of both shrooms and acid and have not experienced a bad trip let alone serotonin syndrome but thatus just meeeeee
 you are not alone in even feeling alone you are never alone this is me alone at a hospital i took this two years ago when i had a severe allergic reaction to wellbutrin that caused me to hallucinateu

 i had methylphenidat first alone i felt like an addicted offonoff off was really bad everytime then we added wellbutrin and it feels like a good baseline thats prevents me to crash into that deep hole every time the mph goes away but i dont have the experience wb alone
 youure not alone kyle same here but my wellbutrin and xanax help a lot itus worth the phone call to your doctor i promise be gentle and patient with yourself
 tangent aside i hope the wellbutrin helps my doctor has told me wellbutrin is also made to be paired with other meds so that could also be an option for you if the wellbutrin alone doesn't seem to help of course i'm not a medical professional so don't take my word for it uddude0
 psychotherapy; reprogramming the mind by creating new habits and thought processes work better than medications alone also cbdedibles and more sex lol alternatives aside wellbutrin has some good results
 my name is sydney nnat  i went to a mental hospital because i tried to kill myself they first put me on wellbutrin then i switch to prozac at  the thoughts came back but i powered through now i am almost  but i have learned to cope nnyou are not alone

 mental health struggles deserve care i'm on wellbutrin and it helps me live betternnbut our mental health is powerfully shaped by relational structural and historical forces we can't fix what feels wrong to so many of us at the individual level alonenn

 iuve been taking wellbutrin for about idk  weeks now maybe  and the hallucinations and hearing voices is starting to be more noticeable itus mostly when ium alone at home and scarce at work i may see slight movement out the corner of my eye
 zoloft did the same thing for me i tried wellbutrin too but my saving grace was escitalopram (lexapro) itus a struggle amp; one of the hardest things youull ever do but you got this mama youure not alone uufe0f
 i weaned off of my wellbutrin and stick with cbd alone now so ium uddudcaf on board with a more natural cure i am looking very seriously at therapy for him heus so emotional and scared all the time i mean who isnut right now but itus bad
 that med was touted on it's own as a standalone antide pressant then started to be added to many to help balance the cocktail like depakote wellbutrin etc another swiss army addon psych med bleh
 i was  pack a day smoker at the end of  years of smoking i quit once with the drug wellbutrin prescribed then a traumastarted back i went with chantix to quit that was  years ago donut go it alone but go good luck 
 even though wellbutrin and zoloft are in the same big ucclassud stimulant overlapping antipsychotic and both affect neurotransmitters they did nothing for my adhd fyi let alone depression
 zoloft rlly b fucking shit up when i take it alone but lucky for me wellbutrin makes me skinny and horn knee so it balances out 
 i was gonna say the same thing wellbutrin alone was making me a little too up so my dr added buspar and the combo works well
 taking an ssri alone (lexapro) turned me into a zombie for about a year but after i added wellbutrin i feel better than i ever have in my life going on meds made me realize im not a lazy good for nothing and changed everything for me my only regret is waiting so long
 when youure trying to lose weight and keep it off it feels like a lot of things are working against you and one of those things is your brain if you're struggling to lose weight with diet or exercise alone we have a solution for you  
 might have already told you this but i have found the cymbalta and wellbutrin combo to work in a way that nothing does alone probably cos it covers seritonin and dopaminergic deficiencies
 wellbutrin in my opinion isnut a stand alone med i did it on a medium level dosage at first and it sucked then i switched to the effexor switched back to wellbutrin but up the dosage and added lexapro worked well
 you aren't alone my doctor said he has never seen depression ( especially in women) in this country like he has seen these last few years try wellbutrin (generic bupropion) it helped me quit smoking too it is non narcotic so you don't get addicted it has helped me a lot
 i hear so much about this wellbutrin so zoloft alone never helped you??
 september   finally fighting my way out of wellbutrin withdrawal hell only to find myself alone and unwanted by the one who swore to be with me to the end of ours days all the while being told all is fine and i don't know what you're talking about
 but honestly i donut think ium happy because something drastic happened i still experience happiness but itus not usually while ium alone i actually need something to take the edge off not like you know wellbutrin or risperidal for sleep but you know thatus all i can get
 i get lost in them and forget i'm depressed wellbutrin helps but that alone doesn't cut it exercise is always good if you can get motivated but i know how tough that can be nni hope you find your outlet and can get through this
 i use lexapro for anxiety and wellbutrin for depression honestly both are good and helpful for me lexapro is great for anxiety but alone it made me feel apathetic and unmotivated and wellbutrin helped with that everyone is different but i hope that helps?
 when youure trying to lose weight and keep it off it can feel like an uphill battle if you're struggling to lose weight with diet or exercise alone we can helpnnclick through for more information here  
 wellbutrin nearly killed me because it handles dopamine but not norepinephrine or seratonin so if taken alone for a long period of time it can be extremely activating it works by turning up the happy in your brain but it simultaneously turns up everything else with it
 my ssri with b works a lot better than just my ssri alone udeudd never heard about wellbutrin
 i could no longer up my celexa antidepressant so we added wellbutrin you're not alone uufe0f
 yeah of course no ssris alone worked for me only ndri (wellbutrin) finding antidepressants that work is hard i hope youure able to find something you like and ium always here to talk if you need uddude0a
 oh no i love acid but eek i was put on antid's way before my bp dx amp; was manic for years wo ever knowing a gp gave me zoloft amp; my abusive spouse wouldn't have noticed if i lost a limb let alone had behavioral changes i was on wellbutrin to quit smoking too that was wild
 ium there too i take paxil and wellbutrin for my depression and anxiety but then i also have several other medicationsvitamins for other health stuff going on i think i take a total of  when i wake up and then  when i go to sleep you are not alone

 i'm on wellbutrin atm the lowest dose that has a noticeable effect that doesn't set off too much anxiety great stuff reallynni was taking zoloft for awhile but i found it made it very hard to actually focus on tasks beyond my adhd alone
 correct that being said ium heavy into overindulging on self care these days but letus be clear i also take wellbutrin every day self care alone doesnut cut it
 wellbutrin did not do anything for me i've had way better luck with lexapro you are not alone
 i take wellbutrin along with cymbalta was taking cymbalta alone first the wellbutrin helps with some of the cymbalta side effects i don't notice it affecting my mood much but my wife tells me it makes a difference
 i was on citalopram alone which was ok and after a couple years they added wellbutrin and it helped it seems to boost the effectiveness and even it all out all subjective of course but there was some dizziness at start (and at any dose change) but it went away quickly
 to specify wellbutrin alone was causing anxiety to spike so it may be a problem if you're taking just that
 no my doctor once prescribed me wellbutrin but i canut take that stuff because it makes my depression worse not better i have to be really careful with medication so iud rather go it alone
 i rly could talk about how much i love wellbutrin all day like i rly wasted time taking zoloft and had unbearable zoloftadderall induced anxiety for an entire year when i lived alone in portland causing me to not leave my appt for multiple days at a time that's wild
 yuck ium on zoloft and wellbutrin i tried wellbutrin alone and it just made me very angry poor boyfriend uddude0 but switching from prozac to wellbutrin made me soooo dizzy it was awful
 i had a session with a psychiatrist last night for the first time he didnut waste any time after realizing how messed up i am and drastically increased my wellbutrin rx happy holidays udeuddudcudffbuduufe0f alone
 but my question first is were you thinking of a study where the wellbutrin was used at an extreme dosage? cuz then it might help my pain amp; depression using it alone  without the temper flares( it alone  wasn't enuf for my depression at  mg i was still taking  zoloft mg)
 the side effects (weight gain alone is reported in over  of patients and is likely under reported and nearly everyone i know on them reports sexual issues) are why i refused all ssris my psych said only other option is wellbutrin it works very well for me
 i donut have adhd just anxietydepression but i did not do well with wellbutrin alone about  years ago recently though it was added to my lexapro and i donut think itus made a difference actually not bad but not good either could be different for each person though
 you are not alone i started wellbutrin after being off for over  years and now to see businesses boarding up their windows is concerning i will cast my vote tomorrow for and pray he wins and that in time things will get better hold on itus going to get bumpy

 so i don't post about my mental health issues often but i do have some things i wanted to share i started wellbutrin at the end on nov on top of my lexapron  my hoarding was becoming a problem i was happy but never had the energy for anything let alone people ()
 in men's magazines and gay periodicals they advertise wellbutrin as an anti depressant with the least amount of sexual dysfunction that alone snowballed into a depressed state when knowing you can't get pleasure like before and thinking you are a disappointment to your partner
 in addition to generally being chaotic in the personal and global sense this last year was absolute psyche med hell for me within the last yr alone i cycled thru zoloft lexapro wellbutrin lamictal adderall valium an alpha and beta blocker before finding the magic cocktail

 buproprion (wellbutrin) is at least augmentative  me (on top of normal usebeing less doomer er depression) in addition to methylphenidate but i know  pers where buproprion alone seems to suffice now he's adultnnwhere'd you put ephidrine pseudo?nor is this just adhd?

 sheesh thought it was common knowledge that sudafed as an amphetamine gives more of a dirty anxious feeling than ucspeedud when i combine zyrtec with sudafed i relieve all of the symptoms of my cat allergy i have found zyrtec alone to not be effective enough for my allergies
 hope the folks leave me alone because this zyrtec udeudd
 zyrtec or generic of it one a day  really helps me and i have major allergies benedryl alone wonut kick no side effects
 leave him alone coach he forgot his zyrtec this morning
 i just started taking zyrtec a few weeks ago but it has already helped apparently so you use flonase alone? no pills?
  days ago i started taking xyzal every night for my allergies amp; i swear its a miracle pill i recommend trying that bc its made a hell of a difference  me my dreams have been really nuts lately also when i do sleep you r not alone there wishing u the best on ur next tripuddudc
  tags   factsn(thanks ' ni've never lived aloneni had a scholarship in college for singingni have seasonal allergies and am also allergic to zyrtecni've dislocated my pinkies so many times they don't sit right anymore
 i take zyrtec or clariton  dr said not to get the d   he also told me to switch them back and forth  it seems worse this year but i'm not sure if it is because i'm alone most of the time had have a pity party
 i love a flonasezyrtec combo for when flonase alone isnut enough because i like to not be in respiratory distress from allergies triggering my asthma uddudecudcudffb
 twitter's acting upnsuffering alone would be the worst i have a caregiver so i'm never alone i know mr insomnia very well when i get desperate i take zyrtec  that's if nothing else (lavender tea progressive relaxation etc etc etc)  works  i wish for you a restful sleep
 thanks for the replies everyone i had increased my zyrtec intake to mg all on my own so i'm glad to see i'm not alone and that it's likely not dangerous internet says the side effect is mostly drowsiness which is ok )
 i take  xyzal in the am and pm also take famotidine am and pm and i ended up on xolair all together it works great i wish i had an easier solution the otc stuff alone made a big difference esp the xyzal
 i take generic zyrtec for my allergies and a oneyear supply at costco is lt;  which is about what i'd pay for  days anywhere else that alone pays for the membership
 i take zyrtec every day and a year's supply is  at costco for me the savings on my allergy meds alone justifies the membership costs
 you are not alone i am insanely allergic to ragweed and even with taking zyrtec allegra etc every day i also have the blown up eyes and such
 zyrtec has a side effect of making you tired i take my allergy meds before i go to sleep for this reason alone just thought i'd tell you since you seem to feel fatigued sometimes

 depends what type of mucinex and what you are trying to treat guaifenesin alone is useless antihistamine like citirizine (zyrtec) or loratadine (claratin) plus pseudoephedrine (for congestion but may not let you sleep) amp; dextromethorphan (for cough) are good combinations

 that crap will kill you anyways japan has taken it off the market and and it states it can cause death on the package insert many people have died tbis year alone that were given tamiflu
 problem is you usually can't get in to see gp in the short timeframe where antivirals help  and cost of an er visit is rather high  note out of pocket is about the same as generic tamiflu alone would be  
 but oddly most of these kids got tamiflu tylenol and some left their kids alone sick or they waited too long to go see a doctor really? you need to read the details of the cases
 our healthcare system is overwhelmed by the cost of unnecessary doctors visits  if youud canut get into your doctor and must go to the er the cost is far higher to you (let alone your insurance company) than the cost of generic tamiflu

 no one cares what you do but the flu can and does kill otherwise healthy people about 000 people in the us alone died from the flu in the  season the vaccine may help keep you from getting it and drugs like xofluza or tamiflu can lessen the symptoms if you do get
 but the price alone will keep people from it i wouldnut take it again i donut feel like it makes a difference for most people and now they have the one dose flu med  xofluza is that a reason why tamiflu is going otc? do people really need otc access to tamiflu?

 donut sleep on the elderberry though tamiflu literally makes you sicker than just having the flu alone udeudd go awf tho chris 
 it's incredibly unfortunate but some die from the flu even people who have had the flu shot taken all meds and are literally in the hospital why everyone is honing in on tamiflu as some miracle lifesaving cure all is beyond me the listed side effects alone are scary
 yes this woman sounds like an idiot but tamiflu is not like the measles vaccine  it almost certainly would not have saved her son's life it's a garbage medicine the benefits of which have been overtouted by big pharma so let's have a little compassion and leave her alone
 stop yourself this is not the first child to die from the flu this year alone the others had the flu shot and took tamiflu and still passed this mom has said this boy also had both of those things the flu kills people it's devastating no fault to be placed
  is really high and not lessening   i could keep trucking through  i was dizzy though and have a child alone  just powering through wasnut an option  the high fever risk even while taking tylenol wasnut safe  tamiflu was the best option but it did shock my body fierce
 itus shameful journalism  tamiflu has literally never been proven to prevent or treat the flu so thereus also that my  month old nephew just had the flu a and my sister refused to give him tamiflu and he was fine after  days leave people alone
 vaccines work tamiflu works the cdc said the flu virus in  to  was responsible for 000 deaths in the united states alone
 facebook has had ample opportunity to shut this down since they clearly aren't going to i think this alone never mind every other shit they commit is a reason to shut them down n
 they were prescribing it over the phone not actually looking at patients combined with the quarantine instructions this made for a serious gap in care i was a fresher at uni at the time and being left alone in my dorm after taking tamiflu was very not good
 but the cost of tamiflu alone keeps many parents from giving it to their child because it doesnut actually cure the flu the side effects of tamiflu sometimes outweigh the benefits because again it does not cure the flu 
 i did reply  they need to leave that mother alone  i hope she lawyerus up  brandy is wrong for posting what she did  there is pending litigation re tamiflu  fraud  kids have died from taking it  horrific

 would tamiflu alone have kept him alive? i have my doubts i suspect hospitalization amp; fluids might have it appears none of that happened just sorcery and witchcraft

 thanks so why are they testing it for covid in china? there's three combos i read about plus tamiflu alone

 the world impact of hn upwards of 000 deaths most under  years of age in the first year alone even with vaccines and tamiflu 
 what eventually came out is that the who recommended tamiflu without seeing underlying clinical trial data the ema amp; cdc approved tamiflu also without vetting the underlying data the cdc approved the drug based on a  page rochesponsored paper alone badpharma
 ucon the first day of that system  people receivedntamiflu on that day alone you could have conducted thenbiggest trial in the world everud says carl heneghan from thenuniversity of oxford  sounds familiar right? 
 common sense alone tells you to try it  the efficacy of tamiflu is not strong but still its prescribed for its possible usefulness  just makes sense  especially when short term side effects of hqc is minimal if anything
 europe has not learned a thing from the tamiflu scam during the  swine flu hysteria uk alone spent u00abillion stockpiling a fake flu drug nresults of tamiflu treatment clinical trials were unpublished that ended up being a huge waste of money
 true advanced pneumonia is what is killing people with other co morbidites hc alone will not help it works very similar to tamiflu in that ina window it is effective at reducing the strength of the virus and complications that go with it
 thatus right weull be lucky if a drug does what tamiflu does let alone actually save lives inadequate chinese data today if you want to believe maybe hinted a tamiflu like effect for hcq and thatus the best data we have
 iuve been thinking you know how organized crime gives opposite nicknames? like uctinyud for a large guy for the ucmud word substitute naked and for ucvud or uccvud substitute tamiflu then the spam bots will leave you alone lol
 when i was alone and in prison you visited menncarlos gregorio hernandez vasquez  perished on floor of border camp in weslaco tx  he had been given tamiflu earlier in the dayuthen left to die
 yes i had it i was alone and it was the sickest i have been drove myself to er was  on guerney in hall and doc told me uctamiflu is bullshitud and thereus nothing he can do and sent me home over  fever
 even more so with hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine where the mode of action is thought to be down to altering ph levels that's not going to work well once the infection is established let alone waning tamiflu which is a much more specific drug also needs early administration
 hundred thousand infected in the us alone most of that in the span of  months is definitely in my head uddudeudduddudcudffbnnyeah i take refuge from influenza but it looks a little different because of something called tamiflunnand this too shall pass does not mean you should ignore it
 the whole world was stockpiling billions of  of tamiflu and madly trying to get pandemic (adjuvanted) vaccine and she alone said 'bullshit'
 care plans have gone out of window i mean we have had no contact from social services at all when i had swine flu i had to go it alone the last i saw of them was getting tamiflu and bread and milk for us
 don't tell tamiflu but even her network is saying that masks alone while extremely important aren't enough nn
 ok but similarity we have a lot of influenza that is not tested for as well i know as i am a peds nurse amp; this last flu season alone our hospital amp; cdc said ucdonut bring in for testing treat home if they call wi  hours of sx onset order tamifluud so not accurate s  flu
 i read through the recovery trial two things the trial didnut dotreat at onset of symptoms amp; use zinc no one is arguing hcq works alone or in hospitalized patients the key is early detectionearly treatment (think cancer u donut wait until stage  tamiflu early not late)
 donut i wish that was true my household alone got hit with flu b then flu a a month later it was hell  person household total cases that was the worst month ever  year olds donut like tamiflu at all lol
 like like tamiflu not exactly and itus my understanding the zinc gets inside the cell wall and starts changing the virus making in incapable of replicating or slowing down replication be they work in tandem and not alone and early
 cdc has always included pneumonia with flu to exaggerate numbers sell more vaccines and tamiflu bc so few die from the actual flu so they're doing the same with covid bc so few die from covid alone
 baloney  first case detected  vaccine research started  public health emergency declared on  plus releasing  of tamiflu stockpile to hospitals blood test approved by fda on  four vaccines approved  and doses began  
 a donald rumsfeld productionnthe nhs alone has already purchased enough tamiflu to treat threequarters of the population in the uk 
 according to wodarg the who's classification of the swine flu as a pandemic have earned the pharmaceutical companies  billion in additional revenues annual sales of tamiflu alone have jumped  percent to uac billion
 my only question now is isn't there a study about it's general efficacy?  oseltamivir aka tamiflu is only worth administering early into the course of the flu itselfnnso maybe looking at hospitalization efficacy alone is a poor course? 
 i guess i am asking would you or do you  use tamiflu after looking at the data?nnthey were not alone here is an example of those who said it was ineffective after looking at early rctnn
 also the vaccine alone wonut do anything because youure gonna have to vaccinate the majority of the population for this to end a medicine like tamiflu for hn is more important imo
 you're taking to some people who never take aspirin or tylenol let alone tamiflu
 that's why we need to keep listening to those who are experimenting with drugs like hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin and not demonize themnnwe need an effective treatment like tamiflunnvaccination alone may not be enough
 remember the study that showed only  of uccovid deathsud were due to covid alone?  pharmacists reporting that theyuve sold no tamiflu this yearu wonder why??
