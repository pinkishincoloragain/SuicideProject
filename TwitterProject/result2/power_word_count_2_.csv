 i've taken an ssri at times without running into that but it's a good thing to be aware of so thanks for the reminder my problem with one ssri (wellbutrin iirc) was just the oppositeuit made me actively suicidal thank goodness i got off it in time
 you're doing the work of angels making it so i am too full and sated and sleepy to follow through with my plans of stepping in front of trax any chance we can get some wellbutrin infused cheese curds in future?

 this time last year i weighed like  and now i'm down to  i haven't exercised or changed my garbage diet or anything wellbutrin is just good that way
 i know ima sounds like a broken record but it took me like  tried to find the ones for me i have too many side effects from them so the only ones with side effects that i could manage is wellbutrin idk where i would be without it i used to sleep my life away 
 don't forget your wellbutrin you're clicking without it but grief never goes away; commitment is ever out of reach
 does anybody who takes wellbutrin have times where you just can never sleep because of it?
 odd when i started ssris all i did was sleep it was starting wellbutrin that killed my sleep for months before my body got used to it i kept taking it though it really helped
 i don't think they are same thing i've tried both while chantix worked somewhat each time i tried it it made progressively more nauseous until i was throwing up every morning and the last time it made me suicidal wellbutrin never made me nauseous and never worked for me
 oh man my mind is fucking racing in all directions since i thought i didnut have insurance anymore turns out i had overpaid my insurance and well i do have insurance so iuve been without my wellbutrin and oh man is it noticeable
 high dose of wellbutrin and xanax as needed i only take it on a weekend so i can sleep as much as i can do not drink and take it you might have a blackout

 i know itus individual but wellbutrin has literally changed my life with how much it helps me i have hyperhidrosis so i never stop sweating and havenut noticed any difference the insomnia scared me bad but evened out after two weeks i took melatonin to get through it
 celexa made me emotionally dead and my depression so much worse some really serious suicidal ideation all the physical side effects toonnzoloft did the emotionally dead thing but not as extremennwellbutrin had me awake for  hrs at a time with no appetite
 wellbutrin was added to my meds in the hope it would give me a sex drive again any amount of ssri turns my libido to 0 but i can't live without any ssri i didn't know wellbutrin could be responsible for that flushed feeling  i've had some of that and been wondering
 i'm so fucking tired wellbutrin stole all my sleep
 effexor wellbutrin and abilify for depression topamax for ptsd and trazadone for sleep plus an extra boost for my depression it's a miracle i've never had serotonin syndrome

 so as far as i remember i have never taken wellbutrin by itself without also taking another ssri or something similar with itni am really keyed up and have almost too much energy tbh feeling kind of manic (though slowing down a bit within the last hour or so)
 the psychiatrist also said that while she prescribed wellbutrin a year ago because i wanted for something that wouldn't diminish my libido she could change it to something that would kill my libido completely i'm not going to tell you whether i excitedly said yes please

 they have me on wellbutrin theoretically for my add which i have never noticed it makes any difference to at all it's mostly a neutral drug for me but if you are having a hard time with it go off it life is too short to fuck with drugs that are making you miserable lt;
 iirc ranbaxy was warned repeatedly by the fda (who ultimately did fuck all about it) to stop being shitty assholes about their shoddy manufacturing and they were like lol no and that was that? but like ppl died because their wellbutrin wasn't medically effective

 i accidentally took two  mg of wellbutrin about  minutes apart this morning now im in the middle of a neverending anxiety attack this is not fun and kinda scary
 how odd that even with well documented cases of massmurders w ssri use they avoid labeling iuve had suicidial ideation on wellbutrin and know itus real we have a right to know these things without doing extraordinary research n 
 before i was on zoloft and wellbutrin i would forget or not be motivated enough to do basic things like brushing my teeth i know my medication isnut the endallbeall but i wouldnut have gotten to where i am without them

 bro im so fucking tired of insurance like i might as well just drain my savings to refill my prescriptions if they are gonna make me jump through this many hoopsnni've been off wellbutrin for a gd month and uhhh i would like to be on it again please bc i really need it
 i take wellbutrin amp; prozac and i honestly have no idea how they are working but i donut have suicidal ideations so thatus good wellbutrin did make my body feel crazy for the first  weeks i took it i was very dizzy and had to spend most of my days lying down
 i was  years old just a kid with a crazy dream since then iuve taken a lot of prozac paxil wellbutrin effexor ritalin focalin iuve also studied deeply in the philosophies of the religions but cheerfulness kept breaking throughudnleonard cohennsuicidepreventionday

 after enduring  months off namebrand wellbutrin (since my insurance company refused to cover) i finally am trying yet another generic because mi sad is already starting really hoping this one works and doesnut make me sick like other manufacturersu filler ingredients have 
 ? anyway i'm on effexor with some wellbutrin to offset sexual side effects (cause no one reads these i can just say whatever i guess) i can focus and plan and concentrate in ways i have never before my doctors are still tweaking my dose

 based purely on personal experience and anecdotes from my friends wellbutrin has been pretty helpful at offsetting coke withdrawal although probably not a great idea to give it to babies nni would pay so much for a dietcoke alternative like suboxone
 that was the only affect wellbutrin had on me and i was on mg no change in appetite sleep mood or legit anything but my libido

 yesna friend of mine just went through this it was bad nprozac is a serotonin reuptake inhibitor wellbutrin doesn't do jack shit for serotonin so if you're not careful you could  basically fall off a serotonin cliff amp; end up depressed amp; suicidal like my friend

 i adamantly disagree with the use of the wellbutrinzybanchantix for vaping; i was prescribed it and i ended up in the er twice for suicide which was not a related to my mental health illness udeudde0udeudduduufe0fuddudcuddudcudcudffbuddudcuddudeuduufe0f 
 patchescounseling uufe0fnpatches alone uufe0fnnicotine gum uufe0fnlozenges uufe0fnzyban uufe0f made me smoke morenchantix uufe0f didn't feel like committing suicidencold turkey uufe0f longest quit  mo before starting againnnecigarettes udcudfc now  years smoke free nothing else worked
 i'm confident that ends cannot be any worse or more dangerous than chantixzyban and that is approved and remains on the market even recommended for smokers (unbelievable)  confident because those drugs have killed and continue to kill
 yeah me too not to mention ium on meds iuve never taken before so itus been hard to adjust appropriately went from an amphetamine to wellbutrin which is basically a mood stabilizerstimulant that works for adhd it feels like the amphetamine without the headachejitters
 don't forget your wellbutrin you're dizzying without it but complaisance never goes away; commitment is ever out of reach
 backstory i was prescribed wellbutrin and to take it at night and i didnut know it was a fucking stimulant so i didnut know just to fuckin take it in tbe morning  iuve gotten threefour horus of sleep every night  i just learned about rhe whole stimulant thing today he he he he
 lexapro fucks and has fucked up my memory for years i tried out wellbutrin for awhile but only a mg dose wellbutrin ended up adding too much anxiety to be worth it for me
 iuve never been prescribed adderall but i am on wellbutrin amp; a low amount of zoloft same dx as you amp; while my exec functioning skills are still subpar (amp; i think those also need my practicediscipline) it really has helped on all other levels esp anxiety
 cymbalta and wellbutrin is the mix that works for me and sweet jesus it was hell at first but then just life without that fucking nattering voice glad it's improving
 bupropion is actually an antidepressant it's more commonly known by its brand name (wellbutrin)  it carries a black box warning for suicidalityand yet you say it has 'saved many lives'? can you point to a published paper that backs up your claim or are you guessing?
 ugh thatus so frustrating i have the opposite problem ium always struggling to sleep have you considered a med like wellbutrin? helps depression and also kind of revs up the body (take it in the morning) if you donut have panic issues i recommend it
 i just want to go the fuck to sleep wellbutrin pls
 fuck fuck fucknpaypal fucked us snd now i dont have money to afford any of my meds and i need them tomorrownwhen i go off aderall i risk really bad shit and i cant go off wellbutrin on a depression cycle without risking ideationnfuck meds are  fucking dollarsnim so fucked
 he added to my escitalopram with wellbutrin can't pick that up until tomorrow or friday depending on when my check hits the bank also prescribed an anxiety med and something for sleep which i could pick up
 wellbutrin be like you no longer feel like you wanna kill yourself but you will never poop again
 zoloft killed my sex drive until my doctor told me that people have success with adding wellbutringame changer the two together are working great for me
 mental health is such bullshit i wanted to kill myself all weekend and today but i took the first increased dose of wellbutrin where ium also now taking it xday and my brain is like uckilling ourself?? whaaaaat?? donut be silly )ud
 i have finessed taking a zopiclone without it touching my tongue nnif you know what zopiclone taste like you know thatus a valuable life skill to have nnmy wellbutrin i still need  tries to get down
 wellbutrin helped my friend prioritize tasks but it made me extremely depressednconcerta lets my mom run errands without being over stimulated exhausted and my yo says they can finish a task without distractionninteresting to see how differently people respond to meds
 just got my wellbutrin back can't wait to never sleep again yeehaw
 wellbutrin killed my sex drive loved everything about it except for that had to quit taking it i was more sad without my orgasm lol
 antidepressants saved my life they can be scary if you try the wrong one but at the end of the day the right one or right combo are totally life changing nnwellbutrin is the shit
 after trying a few different things i am on concerta and wellbutrin sometimes i will skip the concerta on the weekends so that i can get more sleep but i did have a bad adhd skip day a few months ago that reminded me why i take it to begin with
 the meds trial is exhausting but totally worth it i was on zoloft for awhile but itus made me feel ghostly wellbutrin has changed my life i used to sleep about  hours a day it helped with the ouroboros i was in i hope it goes well good luck uufe0f
 if i combine coffee with my wellbutrin my brain and body go fast and i ascend to a different plan of existence
 gonna wait for the wellbutrin to kick in before i write my own recommendation letter
 i almost ended up dead on wellbutrin it was a bad time
 tuesdaywednesday (day ) i got fucked absolutely fucked my stomach? was fucking dying on tuesday and wednesday i had some left over stomach pain i guess the wellbutrin withdrawal symptoms started hitting hard too mostly because of the lack of sleepshitty food i consumed
 i love wellbutrin but it had me fucked upppop until i got used to the side effects i canut use the prescription again bc last time i did the side effects never went away so i was like have byeee and went down again but otherwise ) wish i could rememebr to take it every day lt;
 thatus interesting because those outbursts can come par for the course and adderal lends me a longer fuse nnwellbutrin made me sooo weepy and the doc said heud never seen that before nnit really can be different for every brain udeudd
 wellbutrin was a nightmare for me (i got super manic and suicidal) so i dont reccomend it at allnni've been on prozac for  months now and it's worked wonders for me i dont notice any side effects but tbf i'm on a lot of meds so it's hard to tell what causes what exactly
 no i've never been able to quit hypnosis wellbutrinaccupuncture patches gum and vape and that book you recommended  i'm physically addicted to nicotine and have been for  years sad but true
 don't forget your wellbutrin you're nauseating without it but regret never goes away; peace is ever out of reach
 changing from cymbalta to wellbutrin nit's really odd and feels a bit like tapering off effexor nnot a recommended experience uddudec
 i would always urge  cbt  dietary changes (such as reducing dairy products amp; food colorings)  omegas and of course trying nonstimulant options first (stratera wellbutrin etc) before getting remotely close however  this pot is bad mmmmkay reactionary stuff is old
 whyitakemymeds nnium  been on meds since  for bipolardisorder i went off them twice after a manic episode and nearly committed suicide both times without them i am pathologically suicidal  effexor wellbutrin clonazepam gabapentin seroquel
 love that i have suddenly become the wellbutrin doula for a bunch of my friends betterlivingthroughchemistry
 one of my coworkers lives in a sober living house on parole and he was put on well butrin by his therapist and the sober living made him quit taking it because it had potential for abuse he relapsed for a few days after stopping the wellbutrin cold turkey that was
 i don't feel like i'm at my wit's end like my mental health is being strained any further than it usually is last year at this time that's exactly how i felt i was in a really dark place though it was almost certainly exacerbated by a couple days without my wellbutrin
 for me it worked better than wellbutrin which made me incapable of dealing with any sort of shitty situation when i felt like i wanted to literally kill one of my coworkers i stopped taking it quitting sucks fuck
 it depends on the med the first time i took adderall i felt it right away it was life changing with wellbutrin which for me treats depression first and anxiety nd it takes a week or two
 goodbye  i'm not a fan of wellbutrin but i'm always down to be a fucking doctor 
 it should be noted zyban was incredibly effective for my mom she had never been as nice to me in my entire life as she was while quitting smoking

 steve talk to you doctor about wellbutrin it worked for me but you have too want to quit it stops the urge of wanting to kill people when going cold turkeyuddude get pissed of that someone made a product that you're now hooked on too i stopped about  years ago never had a puff
 wellbutrin is weird man all i wanna do is sleep and fuck
 yall remember that movie warm bodies ??? when the zombies stopped being zombies and went back to being ppl? that mustve been a fucked up transition for them huh so anyway ive been taking wellbutrin
 fuck coming out of a depressive episode thanks to wellbutrin but realizing u kinda accidentally distanced yourself from a lot of friends xddd
 i took wellbutrin to quit it took a few mths wout any change then literally one day put them down amp; never wanted one again (it took a few mths of taking before getting a result amp; i kept taking for  mths after then was able to stop taking the medicine)
 iuve tried it all chantex wellbutrin  paid every hypnotists i can find  watched my mother die of lung cancer then went outside to cry and smoke when she passed nn  i am no better than a  bit junkie and this will surely kill me if itus not already
 wellbutrin is diet adderall change my mind
 i ended up being part of the small  where wellbutrin makes you a suicidal mess tried it for  days then noped it out of my lifennbut then again that's probably because i was misdiagnosed with depression when i have bipolar type

 wellbutrin xl said fuck sleep bitch
 if you feel fine without antids trashbird by all means donut take them however iuve never had a scary experience with these meds (taken over time mix n match) prozac zoloft paxil wellbutrin xl buspar (very mild for anxiety) those i stopped were ineffective for me
 prozac and wellbutrin have changed my fucking life and i am so so grateful and happy i got on them i hope you find that same experience uufe0f
 my wellbutrin diet has me buying clothes without trying them on
 anyway the interactions checkers are always like ok no alcohol not too much naproxen and benadryl and holy shit you will straightup die if you take wellbutrin and ritalin oh god how are you still alive
 at my worst in  i was on mg of wellbutrin just to keep me steady watching the dosage get lower and lower has been one of the things ium most proud of iull never completely be off of it but this is the part when diet and exercise help
 zoloft amp; wellbutrin iuve been taking zoloft for about  years and the wellbutrin i started maybe  months ago when i added the wellbutrin my life did a  it really truly changed my life i never thought i could feel how i do amp; im so grateful for it
 uddude lexapro gave me intense dreams and nightmares to the point that it didnut feel like i was sleeping at all nnthe only thing that ever worked well for me without side effects is wellbutrin itus in a different classification than other antidepressants
 finally took my wellbutrin after a week of not taking it cause of my fucked up sleeping schedule (you have to take it in the morningish bc it can make you stay up all night if you take it too late)nnalso finally took my other  meds after missing for  days cause i was depressed
 ium so sorry but relate been dealing wdepression amp; anxiety for  yrs in a good place now amp; on some meds wvery few side effects most antidepressants kill the libido (not good for a porn actor) wellbutrin doesnut amp; has been amazing for me uufe0f goes out to u endthestigma
 i have wellbutrin on the daily i bet if your ptsd or depression were high enough even after dietary and life changes you could request a trial
 i feel this so hard my only successful diet was when i went on wellbutrin and it killed my appetite for me idk how other people do it
 i didn't notice any difference with weight changes when i was on wellbutrin alone i do get increased agitation amp; irritability with it though its affect on my adhd was very very mild sertraline works so well for me that i just accept the weight issue now
 has for me personally on cymbalta overall they tend to have less sexual side effects than the usual ssris that get prescribed so imo worth trying the switch if you canut stand not being able to cum can also try to add something like wellbutrin instead of changing meds entirely
 ugh i feel ya i started wellbutrin a month ago and my doctor just doubled the dose no change but major side effects some days are good some are awful today i get like i drank coffee without the awareness just jittery uddudec
 me hmm i donut think this wellbutrin is workingnnalso me casually vacuums the entire downstairs while intricately planning how i could live in a cottage in a forest
 i have adhd bad enough to qualify me for disability the interactions checkers are always like ok no alcohol not too much naproxen and benadryl and holy shit you will straightup die if you take wellbutrin and ritalin oh god how are you still alive
 tell him to quit now i chewed a can a day forever and quitting changed my life i got a wellbutrin script and it helped big time once i quit i felt so much better  years later i donut regret it one bit and have never been healthier
 i was the same way for the first few years  the occasional spark was surprising and random but after wellbutrin everything changed  itus definitely an unfortunate side effect my mouth is always dry now but iud rather be sexless than want to jump off a bridge 
 everyoneus different so it might be magic for you since wellbutrin i havenut taken any antidepressants since the paranoia and nightmares that lead to no sleep and hallucinations literally made me more suicidal just to make it stop in the moment absolutely awful experience
 ps sliiiiightly off topic but i recommend never trying wellbutrin it makes my dreams really really really vivid
 i successfully took wellbutrin for  years it completely changed my life my mom committed suicide using wellbutrin in october itus crazy how different it can affect all of us and we just donut know until we try it uddude
 zoloft made me so sleepy i felt like i was high as fuck  for the first month and anytime i increased my dosage after a month tho i felt fine pairing it with wellbutrin and ium golden
 i think lyrica is an snri that crap is destructive iuve seen it nearly kill a family member by driving her to contemplate suicide had to check her into a mental hospital for the night now ium hearing wellbutrin (ndri) is poor manus cocaine causes mania
 also my ob put me on wellbutrin after i had my second baby for my depression i went in  weeks later to follow up ended up seeing the np cause my doctor had to go into delivery the np asked me if i was on wb for the endo stuff when i said no she was shocked
 zoloft made me gain so much weight my friend mentioned that wellbutrin is the exact same thing without the weight gain side effects so ium going to talk to my doctor about that one
 my best combo was lexaprowellbutrin at max doses but gave me major mood swings currently just on lexapro and want to die so donut recommend on its own ativan is the best asneeded iuve used for anxiety overall no combo iuve tried has been right for me good luck loveuufe0f
  anyone else have this happen? on wellbutrin for  days exhausted suicidal miserable then wake up day   like a new person energy normal want to see friends and do stuff much better
 i really miss my antidepressant i had planned to see a doctor but with the company being bought our insurance changes at the beginning of march  so i have to wait some morenn(it's been a busy year but in july after  years wellbutrin began to cause hallucinations awful)
 funnily enough the interactions checkers are always like ok no alcohol not too much naproxen and benadryl and holy shit you will straightup die if you take wellbutrin and ritalin oh god how are you still alive nnidk guys how indeed
 ugh this made me smile and remember to take my wellbutrin and write a few sentences of a luv letter to a friend udcudfeudcudfbu 
 wellbutrin is probably my best friend iuve never looked back nni wish that we could always give each other space to be human i mean what else is there?

 concerta   hour slow release version of methylphendiate (ritalin) is good but does tend to give comedowns despair frequently to suicidal levelsnadderall  hard to get in uk i thinknbupropion (wellbutrin)  has been probably worrking for four years?
 i think at this point now i tried vyvanse which worked great but i couldnt handle the crashappetite and sleep loss then adderall ritalin wellbutrin daytrana intuniv alone intunivadderall combo and modafinil which were all duds what do i even do now?
 depends nexplanon  wellbutrin didnt make me fat it just made it hard to lose i havent heard anything about iuds causing weight gain
 sharing this bc i feel so grateful today on my day off starting wellbutrin around  weeks ago has straight up saved my motherfucking life i still have hard days amp; anxiety but the undercurrent of despair has been swept out amp; i don't know how i was living with that everyday
 honestly ssris are so personal as to whether they work for you no ones experience will rly be a good indicator if it works unfortunately i have a friend who swears by wellbutrin but it made me super irritable itus worth a shot usually bc you never know
 iuve done wellbutrin the nightmares where just not worth it  i live in a one horse town  i had he best head help in sf and medical itus what ium used to since i was we feel stuck cant afford to move ima die up here
 imagine not being physically and mentally exhausted so you can hang out with friends can't relate nngoodnight hope my wellbutrin pills come faster because i've been out the past week and i'm too stubborn to call my psychiatrist for some pills because i told her i'd be fine and i

 hey bipolar friends and bipolarclub  thought youud be interested to know that my seroquel will be changing to abilify and my effexor will be changing to a small dose of prozac ium still on wellbutrin gabapentin and clonazepam my psychiatrist likes
 but wellbutrin alone (okay well with amitriptyline at night) does enough for me that i don't really need anything else right nownnonly real issue with it is the  minutes after i take it my heart rate jumps up little uncomfortable settles down
 like three times the recommended dosage i took ml liquid without reading the box and the recommended was ml and not to exceed ml in  hrs also my wellbutrin apparently increases the effects of delsym 
 between my adderall and my wellbutrin i'm just a fucking walking and skating calamity heaven fucking forbid that i were to take a benzo for a panic attacknni mean my gabapentin would qualify as having an affect on my motor skills toonnjfcu
 i was in the same boat i finally used a prescription called zyban an antidepressant from the''s that was pulled because it didn't work the case studies showed a large  of patients quit smoking during treatment nyou get it max  wks i was down to wk quit never went back

 i take adderall for  yrs np i go to a psychiatrist complaining the trintellix did not work on me what does he do he puts me back on wellbutrin and trintellix and takes me off of adderall his pa send prescriptions to my pharmacy my pharmacy never told me and neither
 i have night time anxiety that for even worsewhnmy mom died i didn't even ask my doc i was shaking so bad now i'm much better and take my morning wellbutrin amp; lexipro (he added the nd when i was enduring the horrible boss) now with covid i'm glad i have them
 i would if it were legal in tx i hate having to take psych meds but it's keeping me alive i do have some good ones like klonopin i've got an appointment to get wellbutrin which my veteran friend with ptsd takes to deal with his symptoms i need to stop smoking pipe tobacco
 don't forget your wellbutrin you're absurd without it but distraction never goes away; self abnegation is ever out of reach
 possible additionsn make sure your estate plan documents are in order have a living will stock up on lexipro wellbutrin and xanax (and revise dosage upward to ucone fist fullud)
 my wellbutrin and topamax are fuckin with my appetite like never before but actually it feels really bad i donut think i like this
 dude that lasts sentence i felt so hard i always try to explain to people who donut take it what it feels like but ium never able to get the point across but iull def mention wellbutrin to my psychiatrist after all this ends
 ium on wellbutrin for anxiety (panic attacks incl) and i never noticed a change in weight from it
 damnit i have to go pick up my drugs the drug store won'tcan't deliver i was planning ten days not leaving apartment at all but i can't not have my wellbutrin right now because you know i just can't
 no but ium never hungry anyway bc im already on wellbutrin haha so the appetite suppressant is maybe just compacted
 but we've never lived through a recession also the potential social welfare is better spent on corporations who will sell us tombstones and wellbutrin for our eventual string of funerals and depression?
 we have to stop using wellbutrin because it's making our hair fall out and we love our hair we don't do a lot to it because we like volume and health nnwellbutrin has been the best med for us ever it changed our lives we also only have  of the hair we use to
 uhhhhh  grams of my wellbutrin can possibly kill you toonwhat the fuck is their point??
 this no amount of wellbutrin can help me if i'm stuck in an apartment for two weeks without fresh air and sunshine while doing nothingwatching parks and rec for (not over exaggerating) the th time and having little human interaction that'll kill me before covid does 
 god damn im maybe gonna try wellbutrin  an anxiety med bc wellbutrin is the only thing that doesnt fucking put me to sleep it seems
 we donut make new drugs we take wellbutrin and add it to naltrexone and boom new weight oss drug uddude0 take phentermine and the anticonvulsant topomax new diet drug take prozac and make it a drug for pmds no ramp;d just marketing spend and profit 
 ium not opposed to any diagnosis though as long as my ass get some help and man itus life changing wellbutrin literally drove me insane and i kept telling my pcp and they kept adjusting the doses i tend to be a very compliant person so i kept taking it it was awful
 uca case in point would be zyban (wellbutrin bupropion) which depending on which country you live in may be approved for smoking cessation or the treatment of major depression or bothud
 nope thereus way more options but that obviously depends where you live strattera and wellbutrin are both non stimulant medication to help treat adhd there is also adderall and ritalin like you said but also vyvanse mydayis concerta and probably more i donut know about
 a student of mine went through like  weeks of fucking up everything due to anxiety and depression when switching to wellbutrin as well hang tight bro fo
 i donut literally die without wellbutrin and itus cheaper
 tbh it just makes me more wakeful than anything i find which is helpful on those days i really need something to be able to motivate me without it i tend to feel really sluggishn i think the escitalopram i'm also on is what helps with mood regulation more than the wellbutrin
 the first few nights sleeps on wellbutrin were rough waking up consistently and it felt like iud only sleep for  minutes at a time nnnow? deep ass fucking sleep with vivid dreams
 the ice creams the interactions checkers are always like ok no alcohol not too much naproxen and benadryl and holy shit you will straightup die if you take wellbutrin and ritalin oh god how are you still alive
 when i saw my doc about anxiety i got wellbutrin when that didn't work they gave me lexapro and lorazepam they never mentioned force myself on a girl because what the fuck are you doing bill clinton i mean shitnnsorry
 how soon you forget the  fatal truck accident involving a biovail shipment of wellbutrin a leopard never changes its spots
 fwiw wellbutrin  zoloft was not a problematic combo for me libido wise but wellbutrin  prozac killed it dead  everything else in my life is functioning better though and ium single so who cares really if i have libido or not worth it to be functional
 another change is that i used to take everything right before bed  i'm now taking it after waking up since prozac (and wellbutrin to some extent) tends to have a stimulating effectnnbut here i am feeling an entirely new kind of tired uddude 
 currently on wellbutrin and celexa i am a little flatbut hardly ever have the kill yourself voicesso i find that a good tradeoffnni hope you have success just pretend you are coming down off club drugs during the first monthit seems like a similar sensationuddude0
 i did better with cymbalta but there were still side effects  weight gain always sleepy always feeling hot profuse sweating (hey i gave a tmi warning up front)  once again wellbutrin was added and this time it had some positive impact but couldn't solve everything 
 i tend to feel very very nauseous when my dosage changes (of pretty much any med iuve tried wellbutrin included)
 i actually really do think the wellbutrin is working bc normally if i spent  days in bed mostly sleeping i would feel like a huge timewasting failure who will never amount to a thing and then i would disassociate and feel very strange while attempting to run errands or whatever
 i added on wellbutrin when i was sad potato and felt stuck in bed it's just really hard i think i got through it by support of mentors and friends but it took a while changing from sad potato to okay potato took time
 uca case in point would be zyban (wellbutrin bupropion) which depending on which country you live in may be approved for smoking cessation or the treatment of major depression or bothud

 don't forget your wellbutrin you're bulimic without it but boredom never goes away; happiness is ever out of reach
 iuve heard that a lot but zoloft is the only ssri that truly works for me prozac put my ass on suicide watch and iuve tried other shit like wellbutrin and i turned into a fucking suicidal ideation zombie lmao
 look at wellbutrin designed and tested as a drug for depression  however doctors practicing medicine often will prescribe this as an individualized care plan for patients seeking weight loss  we know that hydroxychloroquine can and has saved lives in cases of covid
 wellbutrin it saved my ass and a few other people i know but definitely consult a doctor ) anti anxiety meds are sort of a last resort if youuve been staying healthy active and have hobbies doctors usually recommend changing aspects of your life b they recommend medication

 wellbutrin deepened my psychosis and me extremely ill to the extent that i ended up in the hospital wellbutrin is dangerous as fuck but i guess it helps some people psychiatry is a crapshoot but if i wanted to gamble iud go to vegas medicine shouldnut be a gamble
 wellbutrin definitely helped curve my need for cigs but i had to stop taking it because while it worked in that aspect it made me wanna fucking kill myself lmfaooooo
 also live documentary (despite seeing it in person) is another reason to not kill oneus self even the darkest of timelines have some light i probably shouldnut have read the news tonight shoutout wellbutrin yuall iull be fine
 oh yeah alcopop and bupropion aren't going to kill you the effect will be stronger than without the wellbutrin though uddude
 so nquestionnnlast year my psychiatrist started me on wellbutrin a popular antidepressant nnwithin a month or so i was suicidal for the first time in my life given the con it was jarring but not tooooo surprising nnappts with psych went as usual no change in script
 at lease pharmacists are willing to point out savings when they see it ium on wellbutrin as an antidepressant with my insurance it is  cash price without insurance or a discount plan  wellbutrin prescribed for smoking cessation; 0 why does dx effect cost?
 from taking prozac to zoloft amp; wellbutrin for  years and not even knowing how to feel to being entirely happy amp; learning to be so accepting of yourself is such a huge change amp; feeling i didnut realize that till now makes me never want to take anything for granted
 i was never allergic to anything until i had an allergic reaction to wellbutrin in college no one is fucking allergic to wellbutrin and yet
 jk but for real youure not alone with you just added wellbutrin for my mental health med regimen and my dr said lots of folks are amping their meds right now shit is hard and depression is real sending you love amp; solidarity
 wellbutrin would never let me sleep but when i had something traumatic happen i took my husbands trazadone and i was like in amazing sleep for first time in days

 mine always changed my sleep patterns (especially wellbutrin) because i had way more energy during the day and wasnut taking naps also always got really nauseous and couldnut eat the first week when i started them but ium also a sensitive baby when it comes to meds
 might not be the right one for you or maybe all of them suck ive been taking anti depressants (wellbutrin xl) for a year and the first week was hell like i wanted to fucking die but after that it doesnt help me on the inside and i still am sad but people say i act so happy lol

 i highly recommend wellbutrin improves your mood a lot sleep better amp; make u more able to function uddudcd
 i would say about a month it is possible that it might not be the right medication for you or you need a higher dose i take citalopram at night to help with sleeping due to anxiety i have a friend who has only done well on wellbutrin i hope it works for you soon

 delivery is not available here you have to work with your anxiety finding the right med helps iuve been on mg of paxil for  years zoloft and wellbutrin are useless for me
 wellbutrin made my ears ring like crazy and actually did not help my depression and anxiety at all and i think it made me more psycho lmao i donut recommend but it does kill your appetite and u can do sexy time on it at least i had switch to something else tho in the end 
 wellbutrin amplified my suicidal thoughts tendencies so badly i remember doing the dishes one night and thinking ucwhat if i just run this steak knife through my wristsud i really hope no one has a similar reaction to it bc they saw it on tik tok 
 ium allergic to lexapro and wellbutrin made me super psycho and suicidal right now ium on prozac it helps some with my depression not so much for anxiety so i take xanax as needed for that annnnnnnnd there my sex drive is still very much alive
 also good to note wellbutrin is commonly found to make people lose weight so if you do take it it would be good to make sure your weight wasnut shifting too dramatically as for its effect on your sex drive it rly all just depends on ur bodyus chemistry
 wellbutrin fucked me up ended up gaining weight and was a major contributing factor in almost taking my life a few years agonnno thanks just hand me the pistol next time
 i've been on wellbutrin for years which isn't great for someone who has preexisting insomnia either  but without that one i over sleep lol the new adhd meds are fairly new  and yeah it has been a roller coaster figuring those out
 last night was my final night being okay with wellbutrin in addition to my well loved and effective zoloft the nightmares have been bad and i canut sleep  but last night? ium shaken my nightmare couldnut be stopped and i wasnut able to determine waking never happened b

 thanks friend feeling good still i've had semisuccess with it before (wellbutrin) but was never quite right i've been taking lexapro amp; dexedrine (anxietydepressionadhd) but it never was quite right adding wellbutrin has made all the difference in the world udeudd
 my wellbutrin fucks with my temperature i do not see this ending well
 psa for my ana girls out there  donut fuck with wellbutrin  sheus fun and friendly but she will stab you in the back (brain)
 thank you it was very thought provoking and prescient without terrifying me which is quite the feat since the slightest exposure to msnbc or any news of late sends me for an extra wellbutrin
 with midnightsun announced it seems i'm really going to have to try and watch the movies again i watched half the first one and couldn't finish it the books are way way better that might be a planned high live tweet lol (i can't drink on wellbutrin)
 don't forget your wellbutrin you're rasping without it but selfdeprecation never goes away; warmth is ever out of reach
 tonight is a flexeril and toradol night since i canut mix flexeril with trazodone because those combined with an xr effexor and xr wellbutrin would probably put me in the hospital with ss and ium really good if i never deal with that again hoping i sleep now
 i take wellbutrin once a day  mg i asked my psychiatrist to up that bc i still wanted to kill myself he ignored me i used to take the buspar mg x a day and he upped it to mg x a day and iuve had no change at all
 don't forget your wellbutrin you're crushing without it but greed never goes away; luck is ever out of reach
 any pals on here have any experience with wellbutrin? iuve been on  mg for about  months now and i know itus commonly used as a diet pill as well upside it helps my depression a lot but ium never hungry and ium already underweight do any of yuall have tips to combat this?

 dude this iuve been on many different kinds at this point and can say that zoloft was my first intro to this and was terrible but effexor is trying to kill me by drowning me in sweat i was planning on going down to just wellbutrin after grad school but then pandemic
 oh prozac fucked up my dreams so much i had to get off of it i take zoloft and wellbutrin now  trazodone for sleep
 mushrooms have never been revelatory for me but i have had at least  lsd experiences that changed me for the better permanently and immediately meanwhile in my adult life i'm on wellbutrin because my bad marriage made me sad and i have no idea if it's doing anything
 it absolutely made the difference my sex life ties a lot into my mental health without it im a very unhappy person thank fuck for wellbutrin also helps with my adhd which was an awesome plus i was only on lexapro for a month before i was frantically calling my psyche lol
 never ending story meets end of evangellion i will make a generation of children double their dose of wellbutrin
 wellbutrin just makes me not sleep and limits suicidal thoughts but other ppl say to me it's like coke with rails on it for them
 iuve never had another shape for wellbutrin than ucoff white circle l0ud but my lexapro changed to a blue ovals right before i stopped taking itudeuddd
 i'd just like to get my wellbutrin and lexapro without jumping through the same hoops over and over and over
 you are not alone in even feeling alone you are never alone this is me alone at a hospital i took this two years ago when i had a severe allergic reaction to wellbutrin that caused me to hallucinateu 
 i'm sure wellbutrin has helped the lives of many people but all it did for me was create a permanent aggravation at least the constant towering rage ended when i stopped taking it
 wellbutrin literally increased my suicidal tendencies and made me unbearably angry i took it for maybe a month and had to stop because it just literally tossed me into and even deeper depressive episode ni take citolopram now and i have no issues with it
 hi vyvanse and wellbutrin saved my life psych meds donut work for everyone and theyure not a miracle cure by any means but they are essential and lifechanging for so many people stop fucking pill shaming )
 i was pinned at lazy my whole fucking life until i got put on wellbutrin for my depression and all of a sudden i had control over myself like i had never had before adhd
 literally have a plan to go to my nurse practioner this week with the argument ucbut all my friends are doing lexapro and wellbutrinud so yes officially aging out of ucyoung adultud is going great so far

 commercials there are killer  like you can get the same drug but for any condition  wellbutrin for social anxiety incontinence and anything else you have wrong  it always freaked me out when i lived there like waitdidn't that drug just cure my fatigue too??
 don't forget your wellbutrin you're coldhearted without it but loss never goes away; elation is ever out of reach
 hi pals i am back turns out i was extra stressed because my new wellbutrin dose was a little too high had a lovely crash this weekend wherein i thought my blood was replaced with adrenaline slept for three days straight and now here i am very much alive
 iuve been on wellbutrin since  before it was cool take notes ladies
 anyone else thatus takentaking prozac what did you do to help ease the tiredness from it? (i donut get great sleep and ium sure thatus a lot of it but when i was just on wellbutrin and got bad sleep i still never felt this tired)
 new dose of wellbutrin you can have some energy as a treatnme yaynwb also the executive dysfunction? we're gonna ease up on that wash a dishnme yaynwb also here's constant anxiety and i'm gonna fuck your sleep schedule and it's gonna be this for a week bye
 observe how it affects you (preferably wa lovedone in the loop bc we don't perceive how we affect others accurately)nif side effects make all other stimulants unavailable? wellbutrin is a godsend but start wthe treatment that studies show are most effective st
 try the stimulant first ) seriously you'll know by the end of the day if it's affecting you amp; how while wellbutrin takes a while to build up in your system the only way to know what stimulant you need amp; at what dosage delivery system amp; stimulant family is to take one amp;
 right now taking mg every morning and it lasts for about  hours depending on sleepfoodbusynessetc not taking any other meds at the moment doctor recommended gradually moving up to mg twice a day potentially adding clonopine at night and wellbutrin if needed
 my mom once accidentally gave me her adhd meds instead of my wellbutrin so i was off my meds while also taking my own adderall and hers iuve never been more messed up i was so sick full body chills lowkey dissociating and about five panic attacks 0 would not recommend
 also going off of antidepressants can send u through really strong withdrawals amp; itus not worth it compared to my other medicationsu withdrawals lexapro has been the worst bc i had a total personality change amp; i didnut even know why wellbutrin amp; fluoxetine are also not great
 me  w mg zmg for about  years zoloft makes you sleepy wellbutrin perks you up but some eople gain weight zoloft can also cause vivid nightmares and loss of sex drive recommend take with food not after food and earlier in the day so you sleep is less affected 
 wellbutrin was a bad drug for me i had the whole suicide ideation going and luckily a friend just happened to send me a documentary on it while i was going thru it
 ium personally on wellbutrin for other reasons but it has helped my adhd immensely with little change in personality a friend of mine is on more classic meds he has def changed some heus more confident and less insecure about small stuff cocky sometimes even
 don't forget your wellbutrin you're rasping without it but anxiety never goes away; comunion is ever out of reach
 stopping wellbutrin abruptly can result in withdraw symptoms so bad that it can kill you udeuddudeuddudeudd they recommend a  month weaning period bc of how difficult it is to deal with it hopefully they can get you more super soon
 i was never suicidal until i was put on strattera and wellbutrin at the same time still traumatised from the mood swings and afraid of walking over bridges
 effexor made me suicidal and wellbutrin increased my anxiety without doing anything for my mood even when prescribed worth lexapro ium still on lexapro but strattera is supposed to be good for mood and adhd
 my doc was the who recommended the vitamin d i asked why since i'm out in the sun most of the day and he just said try it i got a giant jar of it and noticed that whenever i felt bad it was when i forgot to take it even while still on wellbutrin
 i have read the casesnand i fail to see why you are so desperate to defend these criminals unless you are their lawyernoh and wellbutrin similar to viagra was originally developed as a heart medication it's a vasodilator anyone taking a tenth of those pills would die

 second day without wellbutrin in four years my brain feels like scrambled eggs med changes suck 
 i am  running on postsleepless night delirium and wellbutrin but ium feeling hopeful and healing rn sending all yuall some good vibes so we can share uddudc
 lexamil was useless for me as well  all of the side effects with no actual effect well done for pushing on to find the thing that works  many many people give up hope before they do i take wellbutrin now and i can honestly say itus changed my life
  the cops fault if they weren't being dickwads you wouldn't have had to protest all weekendnni don't get that anymore i get sad sometimes if i forget my wellbutrin but if i don't take the other stuff i absolutely won't sleep so i need it every night
 they still kept me on haldol but for some reason i was feeling emotional overwhelmed and suicidal then my tinnitus started getting to me really bad an i felt extremely suicidal then most of it ended up subsiding but when i met with my psyc he wanted to put me wellbutrin but
 woke up with a really severe headache (allergies) and wasnut really paying attention when i went to take meds i accidentally took a sleeping pill instead of my wellbutrin something iuve never done before today will be interesting

 oddly enough stimulants kill your appetite and interrupt sleep even when taking early i guess my point is that there are other options or regimens so that you arenut so heavily reliant iud start with tapering down and augmenting with mg wellbutrin if i were your doc
 iuve never done this before so ium having  juices a day with my truvada and wellbutrin bottom diet
 i take latina wellbutrin xl ativan and nuvigil nnlike three of those have that suicidal ideation side effect nnbut then nuvigil makes you fucking pumped nnmy body doesnut know what the fuck to do ucomg guys im so sad but fuck ium energeticud
 wellbutrin is rough it makes my hubby damn near suicidal when he takes it zoloft ended up being the answer for him maybe your doc can find another type of antidepressant that works better with your brain chemistry?
 pretty sure wellbutrin was the one that absolutely destroyed my appetite whole days would go by where i'd just forget to eat because i simply never got hungry nnbodies are weird is what i'm saying
 i think it commonly does prozac has a tendency to kill the ability to orgasm and wellbutrin has helped
 weed amp; wellbutrin changed my life therapy didnut really help at all i was on mirtazipine but it made me a zombie all day amp; the doctor prescribed it for a xanax addiction iuve never had so idrk weed really helped with nightmares tho  gapabentin as needed
 i couldn't last  days on mg of wellbutrin because it made me manic afffff it was fucking terrible now i'm on zoloft and sleeping all the time and can't eat solid food uddude
 i take abilify and wellbutrin and it keeps me from depression and a lot of my suicidal ideation and ium grateful to drugs and my therapist and my psychiatrist and anyone who stigmatizes mental health care can fuck off into the sun uufe0f also it should be cheaper  yep uufe0f uddudcaf 
 i think part of it might be because ium on wellbutrin and concerta and so the wellbutrin stays in my system i definitely can tell certain weekends when i skip the concerta though like if iuve been super busy and want to be able to sleep in my brain just crashes for the day
 fuck im horny today curse you wellbutrinand tired even tho i've gotten good sleep for the past two days
 hrt had no impact on that it was ssris that fucked it up (wellbutrin seems to help?) 
 ive never heard of a doctor telling someone you have to quit taking wellbutrin or it is definitely going to be what kills you and soon and they just keep using it unable to stop and resigned to their fate
 snris are wild man effexor? always asleep and canut cum wellbutrin? good thing iuve got insomnia because if i donut get off  times a day iull die but hey at least that helps with the headaches
 i have depression anxiety adhd and ocd lmaoo i take  mg of wellbutrin  mg of buspirone  mg of concerta and at night i take  mg of trazadone because i canut fall asleep without drugs )))
 idek what to talk about tbhnmy wellbutrin isn't working as fast as i hoped they would i just want to sleep and stay asleep i miss uu church because that was the only socialization i had i can't talk to my friends as much anymore and i just want to be happy
 medicine is your friend paxil saved my life wellbutrin got me through the pandemic you have to keep going don't fuck with depression; it's a liar it's lying to you every second you're awake it's a cancer on your soul; be merciless with it
 oof mood med changes can be super hard depending on how your body deals with the change i think when i was starting out with adhd meds my dr put me on wellbutrin  but that med and i don't get along everyone's body and chemical reactions are different
 i changed my snri (effexor) to a dri (wellbutrin) since i had time and energy after quitting my job i started going to the gym most daysnbut i think what made the difference was the huge reduction in stress and emotional energy of spending so much time at something i hated
 an upside to the wellbutrin is that i can convince friends to smell it and get some fucking hilarious faces out of that
 coming off of cymbalta (duloxetine) is gonna be hell but thank fucking god i hate this drug goodbye cymbalta hello wellbutrin
 yepni take namenda wellbutrin cymbalta xanax and trazedone for sleepingnni used to be on abilfy too
 so an email has been sent to the doctor two weeks ago she said that if thereus still no improvement then sheull be adding wellbutrin to my prescriptions i just want to sleep and for my depression to finally go fuck off i wanna be happy i canut sleep
 wellbutrin fucked me up badly never again

 what do folks on wellbutrin think about it long term? i've noticed that an adrenaline rush will throw me into an anxietyanger spiral which is newnni think it's fucking up my sleep as well or that it it's at least amplifying all of the bad side effects of caffeine
 hiuklonopin is a benzo amp; addictive many psychiatrist do not prescribe this pill without first trying a fairly long list of other medications if you havenut tried lexipro wellbutrin busprirone and other meds first i wouldnut recommend taking klonopin at all uufe0f

 my meds were adjusted to add wellbutrin so the big question is while i'm adjusting what should i do with all this new free time that i used to spend sleeping?

 also did my doc really recommend putting me on an ssri when ium already taking wellbutrin twice daily? yuall really fucking hate mental illness so much that healthcare professionals are willing to poison me instead of actually treating me lol fuck the united states

 i should also mention my doctor hesitated at first to prescribe wellbutrin because my brain mri had some tflair lesions she was worried there could be something there that would increase risk of seizures but so far so good  mg per day of wellbutrin xr never changed it
 happy  months to taking wellbutrin it has truly changed my life in such a positive way and allowed me to make changes that i never thought possible
 iuve only been on strattera for  weeks so she wants me to try to ride it out until my appointment at the end of the month to see if there is any change there is also the possibility of just upping my existing dose of wellbutrin if this doesnut work  so weull see

 wellbutrin is one of they gentler ones with few side effects itus meant to not be a jarring behavioral change but sometimes that makes it hard to realize that itus working because you feel better without noticing

 you can become dependent on zyrtec and have itchy withdrawals from the allergy drug zyrtech is not addictive but the bodies histamine receptors can become accustomed to always having it present  and itchy anxious withdrawals are 'absolute hell'  butu

 hello in clinical studies  of those who took xyzal experienced drowsiness while that's a small percentage it is recommended that while taking xyzal you avoid alcohol sedatives and tranquilizers to minimize the risk of unwanted drowsiness
 fortunately the xyzal ium using seems to be keeping the live oak at bay chlorpheniramine is my fallback though itus getting harder to find diphenhydramine is last resort it messes with my sleep
 any pain killer makes my dreams crazy  hence why even after knee surgery i never took them ( percocet )  i am allergic to some allergy meds  they make my hands itch lol  so i take xyzal  instead of the claratins etc  i have no doubt weird dreams are a direct side effect 
 don't use those cus those have steroids bilastine or xyzal are safe for liver  can use everyday etc xyzal is recommended for nighttime though trust me lol i took it everyday for almost  years
 i dont need zyrtec to knock the fuck out lol sleepybitch
 when you live the allergy life itus trial amp; error to find the right drug benedryl knocks me out zyrtec works perfectly claritin makes me sleepy amp; allegra only last an hour
 zyrtec has never made me sleepy thatus why i prefer it over benadryl hmmm
 i didn't have any problems with zyrtec for years til one day i was driving to work and came close to sleeping at the wheel luckily it was only  min away from where i live and no traffic at all
 zyrtec can make you sleepy at recommended doses if you want real nondrowsy you should try allegra
 my allergies have had me on a zyrtec for life always sleepy never sniffly uddude
 in college i once had a zyrtec bender blacked out for four days and woke up in a tub of ice in oaxaca with a note pinned to my chest telling me one of my kidneys had been removed be careful
 ok so zyrtec is the only allergy pill that works for me but knocks me on my ass and i wake up with a medication hangover the next morningnand yes pnw is bad for allergies i lived there for years and was getting  allergy shots a week bc ium allergic to everything but
 then why am i in a small coma if i take zyrtec or xyzal? legit sleep  hours a day and tired the  ium awake ium not trying to be snarky i just need relief from the weapons grade pollen in the pnw without needing to hibernate during the few months we have sun
 it was so weird because yesterday i was feeling super itchy everywhere so i ended up taking a benadryl at night and slept way too long   hours actually oops so now im not sure if i can take a zyrtec but it literally did fuck all for my runny nose
 fwiw my allergist told me allegra tends to work betteris stronger than claritin and zyrtec tends to work betteris stronger than claritin (xyxal is basically zyrtec; same active ingredient) iuve found that to be true
 how did we survive as a species without allergy meds when i can't go a day without zyrtec because of fuckin ragweed
 i left the house without popping a zyrtec fuck
 zyrtec flonase zpack whenever the weather starts to change udduded 
 zyrtec d worked amazing for me when i had bad allergies months ago i couldnut even breathe or sleep but the pharmacist recommended zyrtec d so i tried it itus kinda pricey but itus worth it
 i've taken one hr zyrtec every  hours since my friend's allergist told her to double up on her allegra three months ago  i'm not dead yet  u00af_(uc)_u00af
 i accidentally took two zyrtec and that shit fucked me up lmao i fell asleep for a whole  hours uddudc
 generic fluticasone (aka flonase) and generic loratadine (claritin) the latter seems to deliver the drowsy i have actually never tried zyrtec possibly because it's more expensive but idk you pick one antihistamine and stick to it right?
 i developed allergies at the end of a long cold when i was in my late s would go from head to chest affecting my voice i live in socal and take something everyday  have for years flonase amp; zyrtec are my jam

 i figured but still nnprotip to kick off taking antihistamines take a zyrtec allegra or claritin w a hr chlortrimeton tablet at night on day  and that very often jump starts that  day delay period you experience so it works on day one this will make you very sleepy tho
 still struggle with sleep wake up at  am everyday without fail unless i take a zyrtec before i go to bed then i have brain and zyrtec fog the next dayudeuddudcudffduduufe0fudeuddudcudffduduufe0f

 yeah benadryl is for allergies but it can make u sleepy everyone responds differently to different things zyrtec has always worked best for me claritin does well but i find it has to build up in ur system for a few days before it works i'd recommend zyrtec hour personally
 she's good friends with my buddies nasacort claritin and zyrtec their names may make them sound foreign and exotic but they're really just basic locals

 zyrtec helps me a lot one pill a day if i don't take it i end up with the old stand by benadryl benny helps but i can't function afterwards makes me so sleepy i'm staggering
 but without living in a totally allergen free environment how would i know that itus just that zyrtec works not that the lack of it causes issues where you need it regardless how do you tell the difference? is there a difference?
 iuve never seen a group of bigger whiners than socalled rangers fans that go to  games a season and uclove the smell of the fresh cut grassud first of all no one in texas likes the smell of fresh cut grass without taking a zyrtec and sneezing all day

 imagine living a life where the air tries to kill you uddude0 but flonase and zyrtec and then benadryl at night if youure really uncomfortable
 but yeah too much antihistamines does that to me too  it's part of why i've been using antihistamines delivered through eyedrops and nasal spray  if that's what's bothering me i can get relief without adding claritin and benedryl to the zyrtec (for example)
 my plans for this morning?   well itus spring in kansas so my allergies are fucked  so ium gonna take a zyrtec and see if i can mow the yard before it knocks me out for  hours and i wake up and can breathe and smell for a day     as you were

 zyrtec was a waste of my money cuz these allergies are killing me
 it's bad here too zyrtec doesn't seem to be working much of a defense  or maybe it would be so much worse without it and be careful not to dry out your sinuses too much  i recommend using a nasal saline solution allergies pollenpocalypse
 jesus died for our sins but not our allergies so be safe at the bbqs and stay zyrtec'd up friends

 this is on one benadryl? dude better not get hives  i have to take  every  hours  a day plus a zyrtec and xyzal johnwouldbedead tytlive
 i've found it's best to pair with flonase plus saline spray zyrtec and claritin work with different allergens so it depends on your allergies they also take  days of use before benefits are maximized benadryl is better overall but makes you sleepy shots work best

 zyrtec they make look little but theyre rly effectivennalt (for itchy  very bad) benadryl tho this stuff can be killer bc sometimes u just pass out asleep and it makes u feel weird and fuzzy
 i would basically be dead without zyrtec lol
 never had allergies or sneezed much until i was like  then all hell broke loose i sneeze all the time have to take zyrtec to sleep through the stuffy nose for no apparent reason doesn't matter the environment food or animals sneeze and hate it
  an unnecessary number though a wide variety of pens n plenty of equality stickers never know when the opportunity will arise to spread the message n my planner yes paper n all the loose ibuprofen and zyrtec and sudafed and n approx  lip items 
 my allergies been fucking me up all summer and i deadass took zyrtec for the first time and i feel cured wtf
 listen they sure as hell arent getting their moneys worth from me but i also have a friend who goes there amp; never uses her coupons so i guess it balances out i mainly use mine for zyrtec even when im not out i buy it on the cheap since i will need it forever
 wow my allergies are off the charts since last night sore throat runny nose itchy eyesand i take zyrtec uddude let the fun begin itneverends imdoomed u feeling defeated
 and you all thought i was crazy for changing my name to zyrtec diet cokenn
 my allergies are taking over my life ium continuously canceling plans living on benadryl not being able to go certain places and not being able to breath half the time so my question is what do you do to manage these awful things? zyrtec and claritin do absolutely nothinguddude

 my husband just got back from cvs he purchased one box of zyrtec that's it  and got literally over  feet of receipt for it fuck the planet i guess right?
 on a more helpful note from a lifelong sinussufferer myself i recommend zyrtec flonase (sudafed or mucinex d if already congested) and a neti pot
 i take zyrtec claritin has never worked for me whatever you try iud suggest taking it before bed that way you sleep through any drowsiness

 everyone says allergy meds like benadryl and zyrtec will make you tired but they never make me sleepy whatus wrong with me? uddude

 itus a beautiful warm day out the plants are fuckinu and everyone in sellwood is mowing their lawn time to rail some zyrtec because my sinuses are fucked no matter what
 unsolicited advice from someone who is allergic to spring haha if you take a daily change it up we rotate between costco brand zyrtec and allegra the switch helps and the costco ones are cheap if itus worse at night do a sinus rinse  hr before bed sorry friend
 studies have shown that zyrtec is slightly more effective than claritin when it comes to allergy relief however zyrtec has a slightly higher risk of sleepinessnnread more

 i tend to be fine most of the time (and i took claritinzyrtec for most of my adolescence) but when there's a drastic change in the weather (not really the temperatures more than the humidity) things really go off the rails for me
 at a crossroad as to whether i should tough out the runny nose i'm currently experiencing or take a zyrtec pill and watch my spirit die knowing my immune system is weak and will never adapt
 my dr had never heard of it it's an auto immune reaction condition that's only testable by symptoms if other stuff is ruled put and only treated with diet and antihistamines i have to take zyrtec everyday for it or i get so itchy my hands burn and ache etc just a thought
 i have never had such bad allergies before living on zyrtec sudafed benadryl and my neti pot
 and the tree company passed out zyrtec all night long and everyone lived happily ever after the end

 my parents lab use to have bad allergies when they lived in the desert their vet actually recommended to give one zyrtec in the mornings with her other supplements it helped her she scratched less often and didn't bite at her skin as much

 hi paul in clinical studies  of those who took xyzal experienced drowsiness while that's a small percentage it is recommended that while taking xyzal you avoid alcohol sedatives and tranquilizers to minimize the risk of unwanted drowsiness
 they tend to alternate on various frequences so its hard to know where they hit the next time a lot of the sympthomes are allergy related and i've found that mg of zyrtec(antihistamine) kills the worst effects of many of their attacks
 ium in australia so not sure if you have this product but ium on a nasal spray called flixonase dead set life changer i used to find that iud get used to the allergy tabs and weure having to change it up often and my life was miserable zyrtec eye drops too

 it doesn't make me sleepy unless i pair it with aspirin (which is also why nyquil works ) i find that zyrtec and flonase both work well without making me sleepy
 in my experience joint pain is directly related to the primary allergy in other words itus just another symptom of the pollen allergy so changing diet wonut help my doctor told me itus okay to double up on allergy meds when itus bad so i take zyrtec twice a day

 that is a bummer iuve been ok so far though i have tree pollen allergy normally i have to take zyrtec from midapril through the end of may but havenut needed it yet ium sure that will change soon
 no i couldn't breathe without taking it which is what screwed my sleep schedule up again ( but i've been having this problem since last year the zyrtec might be making it worse but it's not the only cause i have lots of things going on xd
 your bloodbrain barrier (hence the drowsiness you experience) other antihistamines are zyrtec gt; allegra gt; claritin (when i say strong i mean the drowsiness effect btw not how effective although i will note that depending on your body chemistry some work better than others

 i was trying to get through this allergy season without using allergy medicine but surrendered to it zyrtec for the win
 claritin worked for me for years but then i had to switch to zyrtec after awhile your body gains a resistance and you have to change it up bonus if you had motion sickness or fall asleep from nonnarco medications neither of those will be a problem anymore after a while 
 the doctor said to try baby zyrtec but didnut find it amusing when i said ucohhhhhh okayyyyud after she said it would make him sleepy udduded mauam please do not judge me i have been sleep deprived for the last  months this will kill  birds with  stone if it helps uddudeb

 usually i can kill the hives with  or  zyrtec (i canut take benadryl bc it lowers my seizure threshold) and the rest iuve learned to live through i only go to the er when the hivesswelling canut be controlled
 look at the active ingredient on the bottle and get the store brand version zyrtec is cetirizine fexofenidine and is another non drowsy antihistamine people tend to ignore the store brands so there are generally more of them around

 zyrtec as a prescription was divine i could take a pill every other day and be good and it never made me drowsy the second it became otc it didn't work as well they swear the formula didn't change buy my body certainly stopped reacting to it in the same way
 benedryl may work but i'll never know because even a children's dose knocks me to the floornnthe zyrtec does work for me once i've taken it for a few days in a row it makes me sleepy at first too so i take  at night
 i was amused to discover the agent in benadryl (diphenhydramine) is literally the sole ingredient in most over the counter sleep aids nni use benadryl to sleep and zyrtec for my allergies

 my understanding is that zyrtec is structurally similar to benedryl  most otc sleeping meds have benedryl as the active ingredient i suspect it is not a placebo effect i know someone who cannot take zyrtec due to the intense sleepiness it causes for him
 zyrtec has helped me tremendously without drowsiness

 here in norcal we cycle every year or  our docs switch us from zyrtec to claritin to allegra  nasal sprays it's a minor change but helps esp with our severely allergic benedryl is a once in a while can't sleep or very itchy medicine worth asking about

 claritind works best for me handes allergies amp; sinuses zyrtecd amp; allegrad is good too all of them are basically the same just different combinations of the same ingredientsit just depends on how ur body chemistry works
 yup itus usually congestion and some itchy eyes and this year i look and sound like brainy from hey arnold my dad (king of the allergies) said he started using honey so i now have raw honey being delivered bc fuck this ium gonna od on xyzal
 on a side note and strictly because i firmly believe nutrition if not moreso than pharmaceuticals impacts our health i havenut needed either of my inhalers (daily preventive or rescue) or taken any of my allergy meds (dymista twice a day zyrtec am xyzal pm) since march
 even if you don't go all the way to getting tested and shots it could be worthwhile to see an allergist  there are some nextlevel nasal sprays out there (dymista) i didn't know about nnright now the hotness is xyzal which is like zyrtec without the sleepy side effects
 oh yeah i'm mostly joking about the adderall  i take it but only because i have legit diagnosed add  tbh it changed my life but definitely not recommended for most peoplennlevocetirizine (xyzal) on the other hand yeah  works for me even better than zyrtec
 have you tried zyrtec or allegra? zytec tends to work pretty well for me it makes me a little groggy but not as bad as benadryl allegra doesn't make me sleepy at all but sometimes gives me a headache and has a nasty rebound when it wears off and i'll sneeze for  minutes
 so everyone else is supposed to live in sterile bunkers and let pollinators we need just die because some are allergic? take a zyrtec

 i never take zyrtec but have successfully slept through every earthquake that has happened while i was sleeping since i moved here  years ago

 forked out  for my hayfever kit this morning covid linctus nasonex (thanks lenna) amp; zyrtec; all recommended by gpnhope to kill off lung infection amp; unproductive cough quickly this time bloody near killed me last season
 oh yes so everyone reacts differently but claritinus active ingredient is typically less strong then zyrtec usually the dosage is day but docs will let you take up to  some people get sleepy with it it used to make me jittery
 on a side note and strictly because i firmly believe nutrition if not moreso than pharmaceuticals impacts our health i havenut needed either of my inhalers (daily preventive or rescue) or taken any of my allergy meds (dymista twice a day zyrtec am xyzal pm) since march
 i live in mississippi and i feel like i used to get sick every couple months from allergies since this started i've been taking zyrtec everyday and spending way more time outsidei don't want to jinx anything butyeahthis has worked swimmingly for me

 if you want a good heavy sleep i recommend one zyrtec and one mg melatonin tab nnyou won't wake up in the middle of the night and you will probably feel drowsy the whole next day too
 no but actually it does my boyfriend now lives with my four cats (oops) and he took a zyrtec everyday for like eight months and now he only takes a few a week when the cats are super shedy we also vacuum and like disinfect surfaces theyure often and it works doooo it
 even if you don't go all the way to getting tested and shots it could be worthwhile to see an allergist  there are some nextlevel nasal sprays out there (dymista) i didn't know about nnright now the hotness is xyzal which is like zyrtec without the sleepy side effects
 hi do you itch everywhere and want to die every time you run? you might be literally allergic to running as i have finally learned after a decade of scratching my legs bloody pop a zyrtec before you exercise it may change your life udeudda
 i have allergies that are off the charts and to everything and zyrtec is the best med for me itus not  cure you have to take it every day amp; takes a week to kick in itus not instant impact the way cold meds are showering after being outside amp; changing clothes also helps
 nope lol i live in ne and my allergies are killing me  i take  zyrtec just to get by and use a sinus rinse ugh

 oh yeah i'm mostly joking about the adderall  i take it but only because i have legit diagnosed add  tbh it changed my life but definitely not recommended for most peoplennlevocetirizine (xyzal) on the other hand yeah  works for me even better than zyrtec
 orange target brand box drug name is levocetirizine dihydrochloride i thought it was the same as the zyrtec so i never got it but this shit is great does make me a little sleepy tho so itll have to be a night time one its  hours tho
 i have had xanax tramadol lexotinal nuebrol forte melatonin and zyrtec just to help me sleep (even though most of them are painkillers and anti allergics not sleeping aids) but gravinate takes the cake nothing knocks me out better
 i'm on zyrtec montelukast and dulera with benedryl on the bad days i was on singulair until my prescription benefits stopped covering it never had a single side effect my depression and suicidal thoughts are  me baby

 prayers for a miracle for your sweet friend i pray the doctors and nurses find a treatment plan for this man that pulls him through (  not sure if this would provide any hope zyrtec  pepcid)
 iuve has allergies but never take anything for it but this year w moving itus been hitting harder my friend cussed me out and threw a zyrtec at me took it amp; literally  hours later i was an entire new being i was pissed lmao
 i scratch in my sleep my legs and arms look bad zyrtec is better if you donut want to be the walking dead but ium not sure if youuve tried it or not
 they really giving me a hard time about this fucking zyrtec  like just let my kid attend camp ium not making any unnessesary trips to the hospital
 was on autopilot this morning and fucked up and took benadryl instead of zyrtec and i nearly fell asleep pruning the basil
 a friend sent me a screenshot of someone she knows on facebook arguing that hydrochloric acid can be used to fight covid she also thinks it's the active ingredient in zyrtec it's because they both have hcl in their chemical formulas
 hey i'm pretty sure i had it beginning of april (wasn't enough testing and couldn't get tested) but i was diagnosed with asthma at an early age played sports was in marching band never bothered me but since the end of march if i don't take a zyrtec every day i can't breathe
 so for what itus worth my allergy doctor used to prescribe me xyzal it was literally the only thing that kept my allergies at bay without making me sleepy itus over the counter now and i swear by it
 xyzal was a life changer for me every other one i tried made me sleep all day
 holy fuck i legitimately forgot that i'm allergic to cats and failed to buy more xyzal when i ran out over the weekend my allergies are so fucked up that i basically have a sinus infection my head has felt like its going to explode for two days straight now udeudda
 why are medications named so dumb? xyzal? why not getyouthefucktosleep?
 my allergist prescribed me zyrtec last year but i ended up not taking it because it made me loopy and prone to sleeping at odd hours ium giving it another try now because i feel loopy and ium constantly falling asleep at odd hours anyway
 around ish is when environmental allergies usually show up he could just be sensitive to the dogs without being fully allergic i think your plan of vacuuming more amp; not allowing him to roll around in their beds will be perfect add zyrtec if youure worried
 if i lived before allergy meds existed i would instantly die like watch me in the victorian era get hit with seasonal allergies and no zyrtec and just keel over from sheer misery
 it was a good day till  hit now i have to take zyrtec and sudafed to try to go to sleep this allergy life never fair
 the thing that helps my damn near neverending sinus pressure is saline misting the hell out of my nose and some days i can triple up on my generic zyrtec
 you can do a lot of stuff without needing prescription anything first off ditch anything with scent (soap shampoo detergent etc) and make yourself familiar with a list of the worst food offenders also i'd recommend your favorite antihistamine (claritin zyrtec or allegra)
 if i take a benadryl when iuve already taken zyrtec will it kill me? iuve just gotten my allergy shots and am already dying if itchiness after getting a bunch of yellow jacket stings over the weekend
 on days when my allergies aren't too bad zyrtec can kill my headache and let me breathe on the bad days i break out the everclear why are human bodies so messed up?
 i never get a cold   i use zyrtec and flonase once a day and if i feel a cold coming or get around someone with a cold i add in mg of zinc for a few days   viruses canut reproduce in the presence of zinc and studies have shown it takes at least mg a day for it to work
 yes i started taking zyrtec for a sun allergy and ended up continuing to take it cause it was helping me sleep eventually had to wean myself off of it but it was hard
 i need to take a benadryl but i donut wanna sleep i took zyrtec this morning hasnut been too helpful but iud hate to think of what my day would be like without that
 i used to see an allergist i did shots for ten years stopped bc it never ended  i also had sinus surgery in  netipot is very good for me i use zyrtec daily and flonase if i get very stuffy
 it will never happen lived here over  years eyes itch all the time claritin zyrtec antihistimine goodluck
 whenever people are like uci wish i lived in the olden daysud ium like wtf no there wasnut any zyrtec back then
 i feel this ( i ended up getting my final prescription from the er cause my doctor amp; clinics kept wanting me to stick with nexium amp; zyrtec (not effective for me) my doctor never even sent me to a gi and i couldnut lay down for  years
 of course i just ran out of alaway eyedrops and am almost out of nasalcrom but i have a metric fuckton of zyrtec i've started taking x a day nni think the impending doom is primarily driven by everything happening in the world and fear of how the fuck i'm gonna access things i
 one day i didnut need the zyrtec anymore however she doesnut sleep in my bed and doesnut get all over the furniture we like our individual space so it works  we just hang out in the same room i wash my hands a lot too (when i pet her or when she sits in my lap; lint roller)
 have a bunch of zyrtec and i've been sleeping like the dead )
 aside from zyrtec and wine (which ium not recommending) nothing works for me as a sure method it does help if i get out of bed leave the bedroom and read in another room after a couple hours i usually go right to sleep when i go back to bed
 neti pots work wekllnni also get the generic zyrtec at costco it works for me when most of the others either donut work for me or make me too sleepynnfeel better friend
 zyrtec makes me sleepy   i take allegra  hour  i think it works great maybe you need to switch it up and switch to that or claritin for a few weeks then switch back  sometimes our bodies get used to one and they donut work as well
 yes wallzyrt  instead of zyrtec same ingredients alot cheaper claritin is useless for me
 live and die by zyrtec claritin is too weak
 this is kind of a hot take but posting about oding on mf zyrtec is kinda if ur actually trying to die u know that's not gonna kill u
 really just spent almost  to get some zyrtec tissue and body wash delivereddeadass walking next time
 i hope you're feeling better look into getting zyrtec if you haven't before it works differently than benadryl and tends to not cause the groggy sleepiness
 as far as allergies i got them in my us and almost every year i switch between allegra flonase and zyrtec i have friends that also do the same  no one knows why it changes so maybe try another allergy med
 so long as i live i will never trust generic medicinesnni was offered waltec instead of zyrtec last week  you know they cut that stuff with baking soda you just know
 oh yes i'm still very twitchy everywhere including my face i get both myolonic jerks amp; fasciulations and sleep is still hit or miss  small doses of cbd oil before bed  a zyrtec  a pepcid  magnesium have seemed to be best for sleep without a lot of neuro symptoms
 can't tell if i have a cold or my allergies are actingup never had the latter until i moved to the dmv area eons ago zyrtec and i are the best of friends
 had wanted to check this over the weekend and couldnut but ium curious to see how the new brand of generic zyrtec changes my reading rate since ium no longer virtually comatose most of the day starting book  very shortly
 sertraline aka zoloft also stopped taking cetirizine (aka zyrtec) entirely two drugs with sideeffects of sleepiness and mental fog and without them i feel like superman )
 i do lmao iull pop a zyrtec and sniff some flonase then live it up uddude0uddude0 nnjk i know some people have horrendous allergies i just sneeze and leak  about 
 i think i would die without zyrtec d
 i took claritin when i was way younger and it wasn't too effective for me so i switched to zyrtec and i have been a user of it till now couldn't live without it and yes the withdrawal shit is what made me looked like a drug addict now ;_;
 my kid got hives for years some quite large like welts all over her body scary had every allergy test imaginable  bloodwork kept a food diary no perfumes dyes never found the cause but after mg daily of childrenus zyrtec was recommended i never saw a hive again udeudd
 i've been having the worst allergies for  whole fucking days now amp; certain things are starting to taste like metal to me wtf is thisuddudeduddudedudduded my allegra hasn't arrive yet amp; i can't buy zyrtecd til tmrrw all i have is my nightly allergy med that makes me too sleepy help me ;  ; 
 whenever you feel infection i'm throughsneezingcold ntake one tablet of xyzal (levocetirizine) mg one at night before sleeping in most of the cases it helps relieving the symptomsnnbest regards
 i have to work nights on the weekend and am so fired up at am i pop either anzyrtec nxyzal ntylenol pmnso i can sleep
 i take  xyzal in the am and pm also take famotidine am and pm and i ended up on xolair all together it works great i wish i had an easier solution the otc stuff alone made a big difference esp the xyzal
 girl ium allergic to both and xyzal (over the counter) makes it possible for me to live with them without issue udeudd (not a paid advertisement)
 my allergies used to be horrendous but i started using xyzal and itus been life changing
 my allergies fucking me up with the season change my xyzal clock out at  hours on the dot chile
 i second xyzal changed my life i take one at bedtime every night and never have drowsiness or feel high like the others
 i recommend xyzal for allergy relief take it at night game changer
 i fcking hate ragweed season iud be half dead without xyzal and patatay
 you might want to try taking the zyrtec x a day it doesn't make me sleepy so i've never had that as a side effectbother nntemptes by xyzal but i'll wait until costco gets a generic
 xyzal changed everything for me iull never go back to zyrtec if i can
 weuve tested negative for covid twice now bc paranoia has gotten the best of us johnus dr prescribed him bronchitis meds and i currently live on zyrtec and robitussen today has been the worst so far i may end up calling my dr tomorrow if i wheeze through the night again

 i literally donut have money and have been so stressed about money and my  zyrtec ass decided to spend  at am what the fuck
 iuve never worn contacts but i just know that probably has your eyes irritateditchy as hell nnidk what is going onnnn but iuve had to take zyrtec every day the past  weeks just to get by and often a benadryl at night just to be able to breathe by the end of the day udeudda
 allergist said zyrtec makes one in ten people sleepy so i could change to allegra if it does that to menni'm not sure how to tell her that i'm a little sleepy all the time so i'm not sure how i'll tell
 i'm allergic to cats and have two that sleep with me nightly i've never taken an allergy shot i take zyrtec daily and if the cats bother me after that i take a benadryl
 iuve got bad allergies but not to the point of getting allergy shots ium on montelukast and a nasal spray for my seasonal allergies ium also allergic to cats and i used to just pop a zyrtec and then hang out with a bunch of cats so iud say it depends on your severity
 youure probably going to have to experiment multiple family members with various allergies respond differently to benadrylnnzyrtec may help without making you sleepy (then again it may not help or it may help while also making you sleepy)
 well it depends how many of the plants there i am allergic to because zyrtec can only do so much

 i didnut even think about this until i read your tweet but when i was in college i didnut have health insurance and i was living in a run down college rental home that made my asthma and allergies horrendous i couldnut afford my zyrtec (which wasnut otc yet) or my asthma meds
 i've the same issue though zyrtec and monthly are the best for this ie dust allergy udeudd and make sure your bed is clean while you sleep else make it clean with a dettol spray or change bedsheet
 unfortunately benadryl is shortlived zyrtec provides you with all day relief but i agree lol that does aid sleep

 gotta survive without zyrtec until my allergist appt on friday please send help
 i was just having this conversation with my best friend never had them before then bam miserable zyrtec has been a life saver this past few weeks
 oh god zyrtec never again it was like a sleeping pill crossed with a stupid pill
 flonase is good i used to take that too i used to take claritin and zyrtec also they would help but never totally alleviated my allergies either iuve found eating a clean diet eliminating dairy amp; eating whole foods has been one of the most helpful things for my allergies
 i went a few weeks without allergy medicine i wanted to see if it was impacting my smell and taste i gave in yesterday and took some zyrtec got tired of having an itchy throat

 i never know if its the medication that's helped or something in my diet or environment tried zyrtec and telfast and some others  telfast seems to work for me lately i wonder if tarot cards might work better or magic water with memory?

 chronic sinus pain person here answer is yes daily cold pack amp; ice packs but when it comes off pressure never subsides so i live daily trying to prevent sinus headache from turning into migraine i take everything zyrtec d ipratropium nasal spray etc
 i get sick for up to five days if i do a particularly dusty task without wearing an nu like benadryl  zyrtec  singulair still canut sleep sicku and every time it happens i become absolutely incandescent with rage at how long i just suffered  this because nobody believed me
 we love waking up late (fuck you offbrand zyrtec) trying to catch the bus but realizing you forgot your mask as you're boarding going home and getting said mask missing the second bus and being unable to find the class zoom link to attend )
 claritin never did anything for me but zyrtec amp; probably toxoplasmosis has allowed me to live with a cat for many years
 you might want to try taking the zyrtec x a day it doesn't make me sleepy so i've never had that as a side effectbother nntemptes by xyzal but i'll wait until costco gets a generic
 zyrtec has a side effect of making you tired i take my allergy meds before i go to sleep for this reason alone just thought i'd tell you since you seem to feel fatigued sometimes
 xyzal changed everything for me iull never go back to zyrtec if i can
 ah zyrtec is cetirizine no never just a bit of drowsiness or sleep nothing else
 whenever uk friends ask me about medical expenses in the us i tell them a pack of  allergy tablets (zyrtec) costs nearly  then after the shock we laugh both knowing you can get the same amount of allergy tablets (under a diff brand name) for like u00a back home (about )
 brushed my teeth and my soreness kind of went away??? ium hoping this is just super bad allergies but like i fucking have my allergies like i may take two zyrtec tomorrow instead of the recommended  a day

 a bit less of the pollenirritants would be good never had allergies before but the older i get well at least thereus zyrtec nnbut i do like the warmer days while the nights are still nice and cool and easier to sleep in
 i canut recommend what to take i currently use a zyrtecd flonase inhaler amp; eye drop combination but i know it will change what works for me wonut work for others but the key is the combinations i take are by what my doc says if doc isnut option at least ask pharmacist
 waking up to these alerts eating zyrtecd like pez (kidding) any cough or sniffle and i think ucfuck ium gonna dieud 
 went to the doctor to get my prescriptions changed took myself to cvs and holy cow without insurance that stuff would've cost  just for nasal spray and xyzal this would cost so much less anywhere else
 i just spent about  minutes reading about this  iuve never heard of it even  being uc relatively mild uc seems to be too much  i too hope the zyrtec can help without aggravating anything else i do hope it helps a little bit 
 ahni get itchy when i'm prescribed pain killers i never thought to take zyrtec or benadryl for that i just don't take the pain killers udeudd
 except claritin is antihistamine (nd gen just means it doesnut cross the bloodbrain barrier as readily so less drowsiness) ndiphen st gen  sleepy nboth have anticholinergic effects tho (drying up your nose)nzyrtec amp; allegra are antih without anticholinergic activity
 took  zyrtec and them bitches made me fall asleep guess what? when i woke up nose still fucking stopped up uddude

 we will all be different for sure ium treating my longcovid as if it is mcas and i feel a little better actually taking zyrtec and pepcid and eliminating things from my diet walk outside almost a mile per day now without any setbacks seems i can handle  steps per day
 itus mostly neverending sneezing plus runny nose itchyblurry eyes usually lasts only  hours bc i remember i have to dose up on zyrtec amp; flonase once i commit to that regimen usually ok 
 i'll just work a bit more to get ahead of my tasks take a zyrtec and go to bed my allergies and sinuses were so bad last night now i know that i cannot live without zyrtec uddude
 i will never understand why people put political flags on on their carstrucks like youure just driving to heb to get your zyrtec craig calm the fuck down 
 i'm blaming my sleep issues for this past week on allergies with the weather changes in constant flux with the changes in season they are going berserk it sucksnni take two benadryl when i go to bed and a zyrtec in the morning it doesn't feel like it's helping

 havenut tried that but i went through allergra zyrtec claritin  with and without the decongestant and they never really worked nnpseudophed works the best or so iv been told be pharmacists and thatus what iv experienced personally
 if anyone has any good allergy medication recommendations plz lemme know uddudc so farnuc allegranuc claritin nuc zyrtec nuc benadryl (works but then i die for  hours)nnudeuddaudeuddaudeudda

 btw if you donut plan on eating with the aspirin iud recommend coated tablets if you can but it has honestly been life altering for me i went from  mg of zyrtec (max dose)  mg of pepcid quercetin montelukast and other stabilizers to almost nothing being needed itus
 im not saying iud be dead without zyrtec but id be dead without zyrtec
 the whole point is that it's not supposed to make me sleepy i can't take zyrtec because it makes me pass the fuck out
 i use allegra personally zyrtec knocks me out in like an hour and i end up sleeping longer than i should
 zantac was the other med so zyrtec and zantac controlled them really well for me that is really rough i would definitely recommend asking them to look for ana positive blood result trouble sleeping can be a sign of thyroid disease too
 my dad was allergic at first but i told him to take some zyrtec any time it acts up cuz those cats ainut going nowhere he canut sleep without snow now
 zyrtec never made me sleepy i take mine in the am
 what makes covid deadly is the lack of early treatment recommendations  something as simple as pepscid ac reduces death by   why?  it stalls the cytokine storm nd covid phase and gets in the lungs fast  make it more effective with an antihistamine like zyrtec
 zyrtec making me sleepy as fuck it's even worse than benadryl lmao
 why are people so mad about ben using a natural method for treating covid? this is equivalent to me berating someone for taking allegra for allergies when i think zyrtec works better there are a lot of remedies to use depending on the severity of symptoms get a life people
 allergies i swear i donut know what changed but every time i take you ium sleep for the rest of the day i try to take at night is there a non drowsy?

 have they changed it? it never worked for me uddude i would sneeze it right outnzyrtec works pretty well for me but i only take it when i know i'll be jogging or biking outside instead of the treadmill it was windy today and i had everything open like a ding dong
 allergy meds that arenut covered by insurance are so expensive but without them i die so here i am paying nearly  for two bottles of zyrtec nnthatus just one of my antihistamines one

 it's not the only difference between me and someone who is getting it again is i know how to treat it when it comes if someone fails to mitigate their own symptoms waits too long to take an aspirin too long to take zyrtec or pepcid they could end up needing transplants

 figured out i'm allergic after being quarantined with both these cats  never home much before this yr so they didn't hang around me as much i already take a zyrtec daily but somedays i need a benadryl it's worth it to love on my fur babies
 second thing you could do is take a second generation antihistamine one effective tablet is called zyrtec mg a day would help relieve a lot of the symptomsbut i canut legally recommend you take it without consulting a doctor first even though its sold without a prescription

 i dusted one single piece of furniture and now i must go take a zyrtec and lay down i am the single most useless human being if this was olden days i would have been mercy killed
 duno if itull help you or not but living in corpus controlling my allergies goes a long way to treating my asthmawaking up to a couple of pumps of flonase isnut all that bad combined with zyrteci run every other day and itus never the physical that inhibits meitus my asthma
 i'm scared because i took singulair as a teenager and almost killed myself drove a wedge between myself and my dying mother that never recovered and was brushed off we'll switch you to zyrtecnni'm really hoping that by march april june when they give it to  year old

 well the problem is flu staring mutate every season which is why apparently it is impossible to have jab to fight a particular strain  so i am told nthe popular medical tamiflu kills all the antibodies and when the body more vulnerable if you catch it again
 whocaresabouttemp also tamiflu has never been shown to save any lives
 no no you go get tested too itus so easy to spread especially if you live and sleep in the same bed even though i didnut show positive yet they gave me tamiflu to stop me from getting it bad like he did it lessened it for me when i had it

 that's great for you guys if you read the scientific studies about tamiflu many ppl get nauseavomiting with the drug and only have an average of  hours improvement of flu symptoms it also causes psychosis in young adults and children has led to suicides i wouldn't take it
 tamiflu does help to reduce the severity of that catastrophic immune reaction (as does the vaccine to a lesser extent) which is what triggers the sepsis (and what ends up killing folks) in most flu cases anyway so
 rare side effects from tamiflu might happen but itus not a reason for parents of highrisk kids to skip the medicine itus a small part of the reason why i recommend seriously considering whether lowrisk kids (over  without chronic medical conditions) need it 
 a something like this actually happened to me once except it was  identical guys in suits standing by my bed told them ucium sorry but my cat has to murder youud they disappeared as i asked my sleeping cat to kill them turns out i just donut respond well to tamiflu tipsychat

 i have awesome health insurance (still mooching off my moms plan lol) and am used to paying nothing for the same prescriptions my friends pay  for i paid  for tamiflu and the pharmacist told me itus usually  wtf not like itus an epidemic or anything 
 my heart breaks at the story of this mother and teacher who died from the flu after leaving the pharmacy without generic tamiflu because of the  copay nn
 the flu shot can kill and harm kids too (has the most lawsuits and compensations of any vaccine) besides that also people with shots and tamiflu died of this flu that argument that the flu shot will make it easier is plain and simple marketing
 on another note the txlege ers health insurance seems to cover tamiflu even on the lowest plan go figure nnhow can a plan that covers over half a million people not cover basic health needs? somebody is failing txed employees in health insurance contracts
 this woman died of the flu after ending up in the icu because she rejected tamiflu because it was too expensive at  her husband said she was a very frugal person and it was principle with her you literally can't make this stuff up

 such nonsense she dies of septic not the flu tamiflu is largely useless as antivirals are only effective very early in the viral process she didnut need tamiflu she needed better education on signs of sepsis so she didnut wait to get treated

 tamiflu does basically nothing it prevents viral replication but doesnut kill the virus in your body alreadynnso donut waste your money itull save you like a few days of symptoms uddude0
 it does not treat the influenza virus and inferring so is disingenuous 000 people died of the flu virus in the us during the  season  antiviral medication such as tamiflu exists and can save lives sugar pills can not from your web site 
 we have insurance we pay a fuck ton for it i just spent the weekend with a fluridden mil and am going on the trip of a lifetime tomorrow so i called in for some preventative tamiflu nnwith insurance it was  dollars nnif i was still broke i would be getting the flu
 i recieved a call so i was delayed in replyingnnread the nd follow upnnif you can't get to the hospital (see sleeping) or are alone and delirious when you hit a crisis pointnnyou're gonennthings like tamiflu should be free like every other country
 we had this happen to us spouse got the flu we hadn't received our new cards bc job changed up insurance planscoverage we couldn't afford the tamiflu fortunately my spouse pulled through he had to convince them not to admit him bc we wouldn't be able to afford it
 the pneumonia is the silent killer be wary of your breathing and chest congestionnni ended up getting a prescription of tamiflu and despite the weirdo conspiracies against that drug i think it cut my recovery in half
 i tested negative for strep a week ago and have been taking fucking tamiflu and it hasnut been doing shit so now i gotta start new meds and not work even tho ium going on vacay in  weeks and gonna be off then too so i guess we just not working month of january????? just kill me

 agreed sounds like something else going on viral myocarditis? still would cover for cap with extended mrsa and tamiflu with a repeat viral pcr howus the liver panel? ecg?
 i couldnut even hang last night and was out only a few minutes in uddude ium feeling slowly better today and just glad to be back with the land of the living i finished my course of tamiflu yesterday and ium so glad thatus over
 i literally had the test done at the dr refused their bullshit tamiflu as well lasted  day of feeling awful didnut kill me will never get the proven ineffective shot either
 my dad got his flu shot then got the flu and then they gave him tamiflu and got pneumonia and died  yep the flu shot and tamiflu but without it could have been worse
 i guess my break is starting and ending in the er udeuddudcudffeuduufe0f but weure not messing with that tamiflu homeopathicremedies 
 thatus far from the way things happen today   just this week a topic was trending about someone paying  for tamiflu when it costs just  in canada  if the system had transparency the real price of  without insurance would have been known (as published on goodrx)
 i've never had a flu shot and have had flu once in  years it was gruesome but the tamiflu worked i spend most of my time at home not exposed to a lot of strangers
 too late for tamiflu unfortunately ium  days in feeling a wee bit better after a night of cold sweats and inability to inhale without coughing sudafed and advil are my best friends right nownnps glad youure on the mend
 a personus allergies and medical history donut change the fact that tamiflu is basically an expensive waste
 shoot the doctor prescribed my daughter liquid tamiflu two bottles  we had them change it to pills because sheus can swallow them one bottle  goodrx coupon brought it to  i donut know what iud do without goodrx theyuve helped so much with meds
 tamiflu doesn't save lives spend your money on hydration and paracetamol it's at least as effective
 but imagine if we lived in a society where you didn't have the option next november to maybe change your insurance to something that could possibly make this tamiflu slightly cheaper in  where would we be then 
 same got my flu shot for nothing amp; last time we needed tamiflu our employer provided rx plan that costs me nothing covered it at  nthat people suffer so much for basic necessities kills me
 i have insurance and tamiflu cost me   donut change my plan
 but isn't it on the pharmacy's end that the price was varying so much on generic tamiflu? if so it does waste money to allow folks to buy it at that very expensive pharmacy maybe it was at the hospital?
 was wondering myself about the cost of tamiflu when i picked it up for myself on friday nncvs pharmacy employee googled a coupon for me to use and it was still exorbitantnn(like refilling my epipen prescription which as a reminder i could die without) whyyyyy? 
 her life wouldnut be at risk wo tamiflu weuve never used tamiflu for influenza bc the side effects alone keep me away from it tamiflu doesnut cure influenza it may shorten the durationseverity by  hours
 worst part? depending on which analysis you believe tamiflu may very well be entirely useless in preventing serious complications or hospitalization from the flu
 all ium saying is tamiflu isnut going to cure the flu as you well know at best it may shorten duration itus not responsible to tell people their children may die without this medication especially considering cost
 tamiflu is recommended in very young very old and high risk populations because it is ineffective and resistance is growing the flu vaccine is almost universally recommended i hope your child gets through it without consequences fluids fever control close monitoring by you
 i get where this person is coming from but uhhh tamiflu is a gimmick and  not saving anyoneus life itus for symptom management not treatment and ur kid wonut die without it so thereus that 
 the sad thing is that you wasted your money tamiflu and other antiviral medications have shown in studies that they only help you recover one day faster from the flu i wish doctors would be honest with patients when prescribing medications 
 except tamiflu is really a useless drug and only recommended usually for children under  elderly over  and the immunocompromised it does not cure it only cuts about  hours off of your total flu course and has nvd as side effects shouldnut have bothered with it
 glossing over the fact that there's dubious evidence that tamiflu is a lifeordeath drug why does it cost ? if the drug was  would it be a problem? how does any proposed system change seek to address fucking medical costs?
 tamiflu does not cure the flu it makes symptoms less severe flu is a virus and you canut kill it sheus contagious with or without it
 this happened to my spouse last year he came home with the flu from his job away went to the clinic diagnosed prescribed tamiflu but our ins plan had changed amp; we didn't know we hadn't received our cards rx was  we didn't have it so we drove home
 another poison like tamiflu? this insanity never ends
 i caught hn and would've died from complicating environmental factors like not being checked on often enough dehydration from emesis caused by the tamiflu medication and a broken heating system causing my room to be too hot only saved by my friend visiting just in time 
 we have a vaccine for the flu that prevents itntamiflu treats symptoms but itus something and since it can treat the symptoms people donut often end up in the hospital for flu (unless thereus other complications)ni can treat the flu without a  deductible
 what your point???nsend the kid home without tamiflu???nonly tylenol and motrin and some nebs???nyou do thatni did not have a mortality in my little ones
 nobody gives  fucks about people dying from hivaids either no one gives shits about cancer there's no treatment for it so does coronavirus so why do we have susan komen foundation cancer does not spread by contact flu kills thousands but there's tamiflu

 tried to arrange to get my insulin through they can't be bothered to follow up with my endo about the prescription they did however overwrite my pharmacy preference without my permission causing my script for tamiflu to go through them instead of walgreens

 when the flu can kill with it without tamiflu
 strange that before the fact in the facebooks screenshots she says she never even picked up the tamiflu nnsounds like shes changing the story to avoid criminal charges for not following medical advice
 some antivaxx mom just killed her kid by denying prescribed medication while cheered on to use herbal remedies by a facebook group smdhn
 but she never even picked up the tamiflu her babies never even got a flu shot which is proven to lessen the severity of the flu she was at the hospital before her son that died was having seizures
 you do know star anise is the main ingredient in tamiflu??? a pharmaceutical? and that most drugs today are synthesized through plant extracts also food is pretty damn important especially for someone immunocompromised there are food you should and shouldnut eat for a reason
 anyways zadrozny makes the leap that not using tamiflu caused the childus death however in an interview the mother confides that she did give every medication recommended by her doctors and he still died 
 have you read a vaccine tamiflu insert? have you researched the ingredients? see how the fda categorizes them? have you looked at the national vaccine injury comp program? last year a  yr old tried to jump out of a hospital window after getting tamiflu readtheinsert

 no one is arguing that tamiflu is for everyonewithout severe side effects chemotherapy is also not recommended to the general public and even some actual cancer patients the whole point of this dang thread is that sometimes you gotta weigh awful side effects against death
 but isn't tamiflu supposed to help flu victims?nnyes and it does but has never been touted as a miracle cure either and does not step in for the flu vaccine rather it adds to the bodies fightand only for some strains of the flu
 tamiflu a medicine which inhibits the proliferation of the flu virus is also under attack antivaxxers suggest those who die after taking tamiflu died from the medication itself and not because anyone taking medication against a deadly illness was already at risk of dying 
 they literally did every damn thing recommended by doctors including giving the tamiflu but of course the fucking social media vampires have latched onto her having asked a question in a stupid fb group
 you had flu you took tamiflu and are still alive but yet you say  it wasn't a success how do you know it wasn't the tamiflu that stopped your flu? or are you judging it on the fact your comments suggest you are actually 'brain dead'
 if you think this situation couldnut get worse there are still people in this thread claiming tamiflu is deadly the lack of common sense in this country never ceases to horrify me 
 iuve seen the screenshots of what she posted at the time she didnut use tamiflu on the other kids the one who died did so in the house and she performed cpr sheud never taken this one to the hospital

 i dont like hypothetical questions i'm not an antivaxxer tamiflu has been proven innefective in many studies and had the mother given it to her child and the child still died do you arrest the doctor for murder? the flu kills its very unfortunate do we know the whole story? 
 it's a total hypothetical to assume the child would have lived with tamiflu might have killed him even faster just a phony blame game
 tamiflu is a safe drugnthe flu can be deadly (please read history of  epidemic)nvaccines donut cause autism; they save lives 
 donut give her anymore airtime to vilify parents for doing the right thing tamiflu lists death as a possible adverse effect i would never use it  i would never give it to my child this womanus history of antagonizing parents of children who died is abhorrent
 thereus been an article circulating among the anti vaccine community about a kid who had an allergic reaction to tamiflu and supposedly tried to kill their mom so sad that misinformation is leading to innocent children losing their lives
 exactly to me moms decision to not pursue treatment when it became obvious the natural remedies werenut working is worse then not giving him the a tamiflu to begin with he could have still been saved possibly even without tamiflu if mom has just acted sooner

 wow just read a story about a  yo dying from the flu cause his mother didnut give him tamiflu but instead used home remedies she got off of facebook fucking wow
 to be honest  itus hard to kill viruses  in this case  the benefits of tamiflu far outweigh the side effects  the kid died  most likely from anoxic brain injury since he cardiac arrested at home and the mom started cpr
 anti seizure medicine is not comparable to tamiflu tamiflu is not a cure for flu which is rarely deadly i am curious what causes your seizures though i am sorry that you experience them but no one belongs in prison for choosing what goes into their own bodies
 absolute garbage your article is trash this video is propaganda you don't know the mom you never interviewed her she went against her better judgement and allowed her son to have tamiflu and now he's dead how tragic you choose to prey upon this family with your false news
 i mean sure the kid is dead but hey if it took tamiflu it would be worse he'd diennwhat
 no it's about timing tamiflu stops the virus from replicating and getting worse so that your body has a better chance of fighting it off faster which is why it's recommended to be taken as soon as possible you fuckin dingus
 tamiflu isn't all that effective but it's the best treatment available for established flu and better than lavender oil etc   it's true nobody made her but perhaps they should have done   this is a dead child not a bargaining chip
 it's incredibly unfortunate but some die from the flu even people who have had the flu shot taken all meds and are literally in the hospital why everyone is honing in on tamiflu as some miracle lifesaving cure all is beyond me the listed side effects alone are scary

 my point is that of you're trying to avoid febrile seizures you need medication to bring down the fever tamiflu (problematic for reasons that are irrelevant to my point right now) is not a fever reducer and would not have changed the outcome if he died from febrile seizures

 the flu kills a fuck load more people than tamiflu
 for a med mal case iuve been working on iuve done a great deal of research into tamiflu studies do recommend giving tamiflu especially to the very young  very old and immuno compromised tamiflu has minimal side effects so itus always best to err  on the side of safety
 i read that she did in fact give her child the tamiflu and then the child died the media wrote that article without ever interviewing the mother
 although she should have given her son the tamilfu most people can recover from the flu on their own without it itus very unlucky for the mom and kid that he died i donut think they even prescribe tamiflu if youure not seen in the first two days of getting the flu

 also the kid literally died without taking tamiflu what does that tell you? (hint it means the flu can lead to death so the correlation of tamiflu  tylenol and flu death is literally just a spurious correlation go take basic statistics)
 antivirals like tamiflu are only prescribed when a patient is genuinely in danger of dying from the flu the amount of cases where people say nah i don't need it the doctors just overreacting and end up dead is rampant
 but she didnut give her child the tamiflu thatus why the child died nnfuck antivaxxers

 i get that i had a severe reaction to the flu shot but i'd never advocate for people not getting theirs you can have an allergy to anything at any time i'm my daughter's only parent and i honestly could have died so i'm very thankful i got the tamiflu
 the whole story is bullshit  the mother was never interviewed and disputes the whole story  the kid was vaccinated  most of the kids who die of flu are vaccinated and get tamiflu
 she did take the prescription the doctor gave her she reported it to several news stations the doctor recommended tamiflu the boy died after should the doctor be arrested? what about tamiflu makers?udeudd
 corrected? by who? has she changed her original statements regarding tamiflu?  nium not dunking this is what antivax mentality leads to ni do feel for the mother i think she was taken advantage of by larry cook amp; friends for her other kids sakes i hope she learns from this

 my four year old got influenza b last week and ended up having a seizure this fucking pisses me off so bad we donut have insurance right now and i still took her directly to the er where she was diagnosed and we got tamiflu i cannot imagine not giving her the medicine
 if my four year old stepson gets the flu you better fucking believe i'm going to insist his parents get him a goddamn dose of tamiflu although that'd be their plan because they're smart 
 it turns out that the story was fake the mother gave the kid the tamiflu and he still died vaccines are the best course of prevention and tamiflu might still save a few lives there is a gofundme in the article i stand by the things i said previously nn

 itus very easy to get exempt from vaccinations you claim that they are against your religious beliefs and they will let you attend anyway nnjust a note that tamiflu is not a vaccine
 my youngest son () has the flu right now tamiflu has been a godsend for him even with his prescription and otc remedies heus still suffering and miserable his temp got as high as  i simply cannot imagine not giving him this medicine to help alleviate his symptoms

 doctors do not prescribe drugs like tamiflu without solid reason to do so this child dead because of potato in the sock quackery (seriously wtf??)and any antivaxxers want to argue this i gladly will come to your house and smack you upside the head for being stupid 
 if a flu can kill someone not sure tamiflu would have prevented it?probably there was something serious going on? am not anti medication or anti vaccine or anything but just saying in the end ppl shud decide  themselves but in all this noise  hope sme gets to root cause
 while medicine isnt always right and tamiflu isnt without complications its also fair to say that going to social media to get advice like take peppermint oil or lavendar for the flu from complete strangers while ignoring your doctor is not a good idea either
 it isn't even about this one doctor and about what he said it's about the many years and billions of research funding that has gone into telling people that medicationvaccines help fuck off tamiflu isn't even a fucking vaccine send this woman to prison for a long fucking time 
 i had the flu with almost  fever legit thought i was gonna die tamiflu literally saved me and i am lucky that my grandmothers had the means to acquire it please donut do this with your kids please donut play with childrenus lives 
 professionally itus currently parentsu choices on how to treat kids docs just give advice and recommendations nnunprofessionally fuck these parents right here and charge them with criminal neglect 
 if you refuse to get your flu shot (with whatever reason you need to sleep at night may be) at least listen to someone who has studied this (for years) and knows what is happening this poor kid was having seizures for crying out loud ugh n n
 just admit you havenut done any research and move on medical professionals say tamiflu isnut proven to be effective and i tend to believe their studies over twitter doctors sorry
 uddudeomg i read in the article that her other kids were sick with the flu and it was prescription tamiflu that she never filled when my kids were little that stuff saved their lives
 the mother should be charged with child abuseneglect that's not to say this child wouldn't have died without tamiflu or proper medical intervention but she withheld the care any reasonable person would provide their child i only hope she now speaks out about the antivaxxers
 so you review drug studies for a living? tamiflu has been used for years with excellent results and is used to prevent or reduce severity in people exposed to the flu before showing signs of the fluesp people with lung diseases it is not just passed out to prevent flu
 do not get medical advice from facebook nyour ucfriendud hawking essential oils and homeopathic remedies is not your friend nvaccinations work nscience is realnn 
 if a dr gave advice not to give tamiflu and a child subsequently died theyud be struck off from the professional register and potentially prosecuted the same should happen to these fuckwits antivaxxers idiots
 idiot tamiflu saves lives she chose to kill her kid
 thank you julieni had the same thoughts amp; question how do we know the child died from the flu already have an autopsy back?njennifer good to hear roche is being sued i would never give my kid or personally take tamiflu why; because iuve read the drug insert
 would tamiflu alone have kept him alive? i have my doubts i suspect hospitalization amp; fluids might have it appears none of that happened just sorcery and witchcraft
 i thought they was anti vaccine tamiflu isnut even vaccine itus a drug?? if yuall get on some antimedicine vibes next ium donennmedicine has saved my life multiple times now i literally would have been dead at the age of  without it yuall need to be criminally charged
  years of age is not an infant ntamiflu is extremely effective in this situation of exposure with minimal risk of side effects nit is sad that this child died it is sadder that those without any expertise are perpetuating a lie that potatoes in socks is a flu treatment
 the flu kills tens of thousands of people a year in the us extensive googling is showing me on altmed sites that are opposed to tamiflu less than a dozen deaths from tamiflu ever i'm a fan of being not dead so i'm going with the who on this
 can you imagine the regret and guilt she must be feeling at her childus funeral? why would she take the word of internet strangers over her doctor? nnthat said if the kid had the tamiflu and still died which can happen no one would mock her flu is an asshole that kills kids
 two boys one  and one  jumped from the secondstory windows of their homes after receiving  doses of tamiflu those boys survived but news reports have told of two teenagers taking tamiflu whose death may be attributable to suicide
 tamiflu can have serious side effects it's not just the antivaxxers who are against the usage of tamiflu nthe child may have died regardless plenty of kids get the flu and don't use tamiflu and they live ngov enforced medicating is not a valid response to this story
 good fucking lord at least my antivax mom wouldn't let the flu get that bad oh my god it's just fucking tamiflu a child is dead
 this is nothing more than a hit piece tamiflu can have serious side effects the child may have died with or without taking the tamiflu do you work for the pharmaceutical industry?

 maybe she should have talked to your friend who says she can cure cancer with household ingredients?  udeuddn
 okokok y'all know i'm the biggest supporter of vaccines ever but i highly doubt that if the kid took the tamiflu that he would have lived tamiflu's therapeutic window is so small and new studies are showing it might not really help at all anyways 
 multiple seizures in multiple children? jesus christ what is wrong with people? she clearly is unfit to parent sheud rather her children suffer seizures and apparently die than give them fucking tamiflu insane
 facebook needs to stop these groups from propagating and spreading deadly misinformation btw tamiflu is becoming otc this year where you won't need a prescription for it that group killed this child 
 log onto twitter and tamiflu trendinglisten ya'll need to get vaccinated and when a medical provider prescribes a med you probably should take it that kid who died might not have died and his siblings might not have become sick in the first place if they had been vaccinated
 i guess it depends on the age but you said you never prescribe tamiflu to children ium guessing there are other options since there are a wide range of drugs out there
 her lavender essential oils didn't work what a fucking shock i feel terrible for her family tamiflu 
 i mean i donut think tamiflu would necessarily have changed things but itus gotta be better than fucking potatoes
 mild side effects are worth the risk if it helps beating the flu once you have it hell the cdc says tamiflu is recommended for kids two weeks old or older directly from the  website these side effects are worth saving a life you never prescribe it?

 misinformation and fakenews are dangerous and can be deadly vax your kids  it helps protect them and other kids from tragedies like this  
 i took tamiflu once it almost killed me never again
 this isnut neglectuthis is deliberate reckless endangerment if she had followed the doctorus advice and given him the tamiflu her doctor prescribed he almost certainly would still be alive
 she had the first two kids tested for flu and the doctor prescribed tamiflu for the sick kids and also for the healthy kids to reduce their chances of getting sick she chose to use natural ucremediesud despite knowing that there was a medically recommended treatment
 first it was flu i couldn't keep water down then i'm told at carespot it's also a sinus infection a week later i'm not contagious anymore but the tamiflu has rendered me useless
 the oft quoted statistic of just one day less is underestimating the effectiveness of tamiflu because it comes from studies that included patients without test confirmed influenza and started  days after onset of symptoms
 i am not impressed with presumed influenza  and prescription tamiflu without a formal swabnalso no test for anything else despite convention attendancenmehni'm out of here
 a friend of mine took tamiflu once and will never take it again for two reasons  didnut help at all   was hallucinating like crazy oh and he ended up with pneumonia udeuddudcudffcuduufe0f

 cdc claims k ppl have died from the flu this flu season alone since we know thatus a lie letus say k died this flu season how many of those were uddudc for the flu? how many had underlying issues? how many used tamiflu? immigrants held border included in their count
  thank sfor keeping how to survive a pandemic as  of your documentaries it was a great refresher on the start amp; deadly impact of the spanish flu we weren't aware the world's supply of tamiflu was so limited more power to the clinicians everywhere protecting us
 000 killed is nothing? that was figured to be as high as 000 you think that's okay?nntamiflu has 000 tylenol as much you seem to forget to post studies that support your vax pusher nonsense you are pushing pseudoscience and forgot to show evidence
 you are really funny again you deflect waiting to hear how you can support convicted criminals who hid deaths in the very studies you hold so dear you ignored that 000 were murdered and cried it was only one drug yes one of many which have killed like tamiflu  000

 do you have a clue how many died from pneumonia and or flu or both this year? in nc? my daughter is a cardiac rn bsn nurse no one has caredthey send them home on tamiflu for  days and a cough medication if needed some have to be hospitalized but most are just sent home
 contrasting  swine flu response with  covid activity just  articles below but note  tamiflu stockpile flu friend strategy  phone line etc vs lack of test chemicals and comms criticisms today is criticism valid?n
 before vaccinations and treatments like tamiflu flu killed over  million worldwidekilled  in the us alone so saying the virulence and pathogenicity of flu is less than corona doesnut add up
 similar situation to this in that the truth was never toldnremember brits going into sweden prior to outbreak being asked to disinfect vast quantities of railway sleepers being bought up prior as well a previous flu 'hoax' left the gov holding u00am of tamiflu no easy way
 often forgotten that uk gov identified pandemic flu as the highest impact risk to the country covid isn't flu  and some of the tamiflu stockpiling obvs not relevant but some of the other contingency planning is worth reading  national risk register  
 thatus an argument without basis we stockpile all sorts of things from grit to fuel to tamiflu thereus a balance between prevention  resilience nnif the risk assessment warrants it we appear broadly to spend on it the real issue here is the risk assessment didnut warrant it

 only thing i will say is we are having more deaths every day upwards of  a day thatus a lot thatus  a week i mean iud rather not lose  or 000 lives in a few months also you could take tamiflu for the flu in a year theyull have a vaccine but what a waste of money
 i get where you are coming from i had the same reasoning before things went bat shit crazy no pun intended but for flu we have tamiflu to help covid has nothing to help and itus killing a lot faster than the flu thereus no way to treat this

 so you admit you have no idea what youure talking about? you said without tamiflu or vaccines the flu is x more deadly than covid but the is no data to support your claim here is the data to support mine 
 the reason is because she isnut sick enough ucwell ok how about i come in and get a flu test so i can rule that out?ud nope that would be a waste of time they said since her symptoms mean it could be either thereus no treatment (like tamiflu never existed) 
 the regular flu has killed tens of thousands already this year alone but all you get is uc go get some tamiflu from cvsud
 they gave him tamiflu that's most likely what killed him covid in it's worse case scenario is a really severe case of pneumonia the majority of the elderly die of pneumonia

 mr ninfluenza virus (flu) has a vaccine already and regular treatment is available using tamiflu (oseltamivir) while covid doesnut have a vaccine or any treatment yet without radical measures such as lock downsquarantine a lot more people would die 
 i'm not talking about testing for covid i'm talking about testing for the flu they told him he had the flu and sent him home with tamiflu without even checking if it was the flu that's never best practice because tamiflu doesn't help if it's bacterial

 doctors are just calling these ucviral pnemonias or bronchitisud either way you treat them the same way treat fever fluids and tamiflu if indicated screening an airplane full of healthy individuals is a waste of swabs

 remdesevir doesn't work on coronavirus  gilead are bullshitting after the abandonment of the st trialnnthe tamiflu  remdesevir treatment pathway which is efficacious in respect of influenza abc is a dead end obviously so in terms of tamiflu amp; analoguessubstitutes
 the flu shot helps to mitigate the flu symptoms also you can take tamiflu to help end the flu in three () days the coronavirus is much more contagious and lethal eg flu killed k americans in past  weeks the coronavirus killed k in  weeks and more unknowns exist
 this seems another uctamifluud study we get another ucimproves symptomsud when we are looking for something that decreases mortality they changed the endpoints of the study  weeks ago and ucdeathud became ucimproves symptomsud
 fair as well but i think another likely explanation is they adjusted based on the subgroup analysis from the lancet data  neither trial notably changes mortality nnsmells like tamiflu
 but tamiflu never showed hard outcomes benefits  just symptom reduction  ndo you see the mortality trend for remdesivir as likely real here? (p 00)
 depends how sick you still get even if you donut die long term health effects of covid still unknown antivirals in general only slow the infection do not cure it see tamiflu and hiv meds 
 i see it like tamiflu i know the flu could very well kill me or send me into dire straits so the relative risk to people like us isn't that different tamiflu is a safety net a therapeutic for novel coronavirus would have to be seen as a similar tool
 tamiflu not pencillin but admined intravenously and with side effects  difference in  studies seems to be severity of cases (which is tied to how early you intervene)  it means our hospital protocols might need to change since right now they are only doing late intervention
 cool your jets jimthis is as much better as tamiflu has been for flu which is to say not veryneeds early application and doesn't change the odds that greatlythis is not ending stay at home

 true advanced pneumonia is what is killing people with other co morbidites hc alone will not help it works very similar to tamiflu in that ina window it is effective at reducing the strength of the virus and complications that go with it

 yes  and the rate of transmission is a reflection of lack of immunity lack of vaccine in population in flu even suboptimal vaccination rates disrupt many chains of infection much better studied virus  therefore other agents eg tamiflu also available to lessen flu impact
 i just asked because people i know here in louisiana were given tamiflu without a flu test and they never got better they went back and it was actually covid why so hostile?
 i'm not saying that isn't true  i'm just saying currently we only have case studies to try and heal someone with the disease  if you get the flu you're going straight to tamiflu and it will kill it within hrs  we don't have anything like that yet besides quin
 its like a sweet licorice tea; highly recommended (same ingredient as the fdaapproved tamiflu antiviral med)
 isnut this what happened with the last two pandemics? meaning we never developed a vaccine everyone either died or developed immunity people have a faith in this vaccine yet tamiflu is in high demand every single year

 my symptoms are continuing doc thinks i may have been exposed it makes sense to protect my fellow nor cali brethren dys with tamiflu its still pounding me i want to kill that bug save lives universal blood super plasma i'm still fighting but man gypsy hrud beautiful? 
 i think the biggest failure is that pandemic flu and major civil contingency plans were already in existence long before covid the plans were never fully implemented and so gathered dust although some provision was made for stockpiling of tamiflu for instance  
 thatus right weull be lucky if a drug does what tamiflu does let alone actually save lives inadequate chinese data today if you want to believe maybe hinted a tamiflu like effect for hcq and thatus the best data we have
 this isn't the flu we have no tamiflu for this no vaccine it is also more easily transmitted so more people get infected right now only  of nyc people have antibodies and that cost over 000 lives and that's with the shut down

 also it's bad that people die to the flu often because they don't wanna spend or can't afford tamiflu so that's not as much as a dunk as they the defenders of a worse health care system think  
 i remember my government spending a shedload of money on tamiflu during the swine flu pandemic it was absolutely useless in just about every regard but it was being pushed like hell here paracetamol probably would have been more effective
 as i said before if it turned out tamiflu killed people late in the course of disease it never ever would have been approved
 as for your tamiflu example you love to bring up yes it is only efficacious in early use but it is not detrimental in late use giving tamiflu late in the course does not kill people like hcq does give me a fucking break

 sadly the claims were never properly tested the claim was that hydroxychloroquine  zinc would be preventive early in the infection (like tamiflu is for the flu) the studies left out zinc and gave too late therefore did not test the claim

 the solution is an antiviral agent similar to tamiflu such as remdesivir nthe idea was to space out cases of the inevitable so that doctors do not have to choose who lives and dies based on scarcity of resources
 will it be as good as tamiflu? that ended up killing people

 did i say it was terrible or did i say the cdc projection on flu strain was incorrect rendering the tamiflu response as useless? remember they stopped production last year and had to switch to the correct version to produce that's happened twice in  years

 thus itus critical to develop several treatments (ie tamiflu equivalents) amp; pray our bodies develop strong immunity through inevitable exposure but hopefully small viral loads as quantity impacts gravity of illness thus masks amp; distancing will remain important unfortunately
 never mind the world weuve already exceeded flu deaths here and we donut know when it will end no vaccine and no meds for covid   trumpvirus at least we have a yearly flu shot and tamifluncovid has nothing yet except by anecdotal evidence
 there's also medication that is being used for covid that has been yielding good results why isn't this in laboratories to test why it's properties help? sidenote  tamiflu is rarely given and i've never seen it cure only shorten symptoms
 many godgiven plants are available to make medicines for covid; few are being studied; tamiflu is a natural element; tamiflu is shikimic acid; found in natural plants worldwide
 pandemic sits on the uk risk register that all governments of whatever party is supposed to manage remember when uk government spent an absolute fortune on tamiflu for hn or swine flu that was never needed in the end that's called manging your catastrophic risks

 you are right nnin  who changed the definition of a pandemic to exclude deadly leaving only novel and rapidly spreading as requirements nnmuch money was thus made on tamiflu and hn pandemic vaccinenna who declaration of pandemic is thus agreed irrelevant
 it works best at the onset the studies were all people in end of care situations had several friends take it and bounced back almost immediately   with the exception of one person that had to take it twice but was much sicker when she started like tamiflu timing matters

 i still contend that why did we get the data that we got from tamiflu studies on outpatients?   lessening the disease by  day hardly seems beneficial or helpful either but doctors prescribe it all the time during flu season    hard to tweet when more needs to be said
 the flu dies not kill over 000 people in  months there is also a vaccine to prevent the flu tamiflu is also widely available and inexpensive and lessens the severity of symptoms the flu is nothing like covid get some reliable factual information
 if youuve ever been prescribed tamiflu and understood how that helps curb the flu symptoms if the virus is caught early itus easy to conceive how cloroquine zinc and zithromax can help keep covid patients alive while their bodies combat the virus we are the cure
 itus not a cure corona viruses by nature have no ucureu  but like tamiflu itus a treatment to lessen the viral impact and potentially save lives

 well that was also the message back in march from shanghai with hydroxychloroquine too we can kill coronavirus  kill it easily if we get it early even if you are old or have other comorbidities same as using tamiflu get in within  hours of symptoms ivermectin 
 so i have a maga nurse sister of childhood friend who thinks covid is no worse than flu and flu shot is  effective also that hydroxycholoroquine (sp?) is effective treatment that has been politicized negative and is more studied than tamiflu give me some comebacks please
 yeah except many of the studies focused on patients already on ventilators many of the studies did not monitor zinc or use azithromycin thereus nothing more useless than a poorly designed study if i followed the study protocols they used for hcq i could prove tamiflu useless
 exactly i think the trial should have been redesignedu as with treatments for influenza like tamiflu the recommendation and best outcomes happen when it is administered within  hours of infection instead they completely stop the studies altogether

 because they're doubling down several studies have come out that shows that that drug works very well if you get it in the system early like tamiflu but if you don't then it's useless but because trump said it could work they want to make sure you think it doesn't
 tamiflu is pure evil you're right on the side effects my daughter and i both experienced anxiety and nightmares after less than half the prescribed course we were lucky a good friend had severe anxiety and suicidal thoughts for several weeks until it cleared her system
 i too never get the flu vaccine and rarely if ever get the flu but the flu just doesnut kill that many people and only lasts a couple of days not to mention tamiflu knocks that shit out most the time
 i never got the flu vaccine until i had the flu  yrs ago i had over  degree temp amp; almost died i have taken the flu vaccine ever since amp; only one time did i get it since then amp; it was mild i got tamiflu within  hr of knowing i was ill amp; i was fine i always get it now
 there are rapid tests that take lt;hr why test at all? the student will have a mild cold for a few days and be fine same for flu if you have ili symptoms you are sick a flu test won't change treatment unless you prescribe useless tamiflu
 in regards to hcq yes the studies they used are flawed that's why i dont trust them hcq has shown to work if used early(not late)and with zinc not without zinc the studies they use purposely test late and at times wthout zinc there is a reason tamiflu works early not late
 no idea i never took tamiflu the flu is something that has to run itus course thereus not much you can do for it except rest and fluids it does kill a lot of people in all age groups i think hqc works because itus being censored and thereus no money in it for big pharma

 but we did spend a lot of money on making sure we have a shortorder flu vaccine contract and a stockpile of tamiflu and relenza and because itus a mo sprint to kill a flu we didnut build the infrastructure for longer containment thatus why ium in the ucwrong pandemicud camp
 well first off its a novel virus meaning our immune systems have never had to fight it whereas the flu comes every year we have gathered decades worth of data and studies on flu we have tamiflu to help treat it we have vaccines for it
 we do many people reported ucthe worst flu of a lifetimeud unrelenting couldnt breathe never went away didnt respond to tamiflu late novjan  may have had covid we will never know without mass antibody testing

 based on the letter people have the option to participate or not with no inducement covid kills african americans disproportionately having a vaccine is a  life saver we have no treatment for covid like tamiflu and do to our careers we canut  easily social distance

 covid has killed more people since march than the flu has in  years despite more flu infections by many order of magnitude there are also many effective treatments for the flu such as vaccines and tamiflu flu also doesnut have the long term impact of covid
