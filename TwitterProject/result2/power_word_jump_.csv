 did people jump out their windows after taking tamiflu ?
 the original estimate was millions of americans would die from covid just over 000 did iud call that success did you know that itus flu season yet not a single dose of tamiflu has been prescribed? youure naive arenut you? jump in the box car for safety
 the covid vaccine is equivalent to a dose of tamiflu for influenza albeit a bit more toxic but hey jump in line ohio to get your ufreeu dose
 of course itus curableif you jump to the front of the line and get experimental treatment not available to ordinary people none of these antimask idiots should be allowed to get any treatment other than tamiflu and vickus vapo rub
 the big concern is ifwhen the virus mutates and species jumpsnon my last ai outbreak i developed a runny eye and a bit of a sore throat i had to go and get nose eye and throat swabs in hospital was put on tamiflu and was mentioned in parliamentnnot my finest hour uddudec
