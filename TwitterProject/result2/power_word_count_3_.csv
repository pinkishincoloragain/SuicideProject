 i just take cbd for my pain anti depressants never did anything to less my depression or less suicidal i was taking amitriptyline for nerve pain which did help wellbutrin just make me sad and citalopram just made me dead to the world and no libido just weed helps me

 i took wellbutrin to quit smoking (it worked) felt very content and happy except for the sleepless nights so cut my dosage in half no other issues however a friend was taking it at the same time and became suicidal (ended up in hospital)
 it depends many anti depressants have side effects for the first two to six weeks however if they are something you can't live with change them asap i tried wellbutrin mentally i felt amazing but i was also sweating like i was exercising  which was socially unacceptable
 i also have  full fucking bottles of ranitidine from when wellbutrin tried to kill me via suffocation but i lived bitch
 i will never forget the interview i had with late actor jim varney who told me that wellbutrin saved and changed his life he had been depressed his whole life and was afraid medication would diminish his creativity it made his life worth living
 pretty sure i cant take wellbutrin might be able to take lithium depending on inactive ingredients  nnnever tried lithium unless those coin batteries count
 as a cis woman i was always cold then i went on wellbutrin and was never cold bodies are fucking weird

 ive never had trouble sleeping while on cymbalta until this psychiatrist decided to double my wellbutrin dose overnight kmft and i dont have any  leftover psychiatrists keep fucking up my brain when i need to study and then i cant do shit about it

 girl i have the lowest tolerance wellbutrin made me so sick i lost lbs lacmital dropped my bp so low i couldn't stand without fainting the only thing that doesn't work is my fucking sleeping pills
 thoughts nicotine is rather useless for appetite without norharmane (consider vaping it with harmala alkaloids) wellbutrin can induce mania in people who are euthymic macrodoses gt; microdoses consider vyvanse (it's studied and approved for binge eating) instead of adderall
  wellburtinnnmy doctor prescribed  milligrams of wellbutrin or bupropion twice a day and a month later i had the libido of an yearold boy  i just got a little trimmer without changing my diet or exercisingnnapparently it makes you hornier happier and slimmer 
 sending you uddudc i just started wellbutrin which seems to be helping but itus such a a crap shoot and the lag time in meds working can be frustrating hope it all levels out soon for you hang in there youure not aloneuddudc
 if itus worth anything wellbutrin changed my life i knew it was working because i was able to clean my apartment for the first time in the  years iud lived therei never knew that being productive was supposed to make you feel good before i started taking it
 i never got the rash but bupropion wellbutrin is part of the battery of drugs that turned my life around and i might be dead without
 my scottish ancestors and dependence on zyrtec d agree i was never meant to live this far south
 oh i have no idea but that would be reason number one why i would never procreate i would die without my zyrtec
 my allergies are killing me i will be dead soon i feel like they've never been this bad i might od on zyrtec halp
 thank you flonase and zyrtecwithout you my allergies diabolical plan to kill me would certainly have panned out by now
 never ever ever going to take zyrtec again what the fuck is happening to my body i feel dead
 i can't live without zyrtec and even the generics are ruinousnnand ofc insurance will never pay for them
 on a related note iull be switching my zyrtec to nighttime because holy fuck ium sleepy now

 it pisses me off spendin  bucks for  tablets of zyrtec for allergies let alone hving to pay k  meds that i hv to hv to live bigpharma
 it never ends especially depending on where you live nasal spray and zyrtec forever sorry
 my homeboy deadass od'd on zyrtec last night thought he was gonna die didn't think it was fucking possible lmao he's ok now btw
 i don't bend over to a russian plant he was planted in by russia what else ya need to know wake the fuck up
 id be damned if my america gets sold out to any fucking foreign power let alone russia's ass over my dead body
 do you take it for allergies? i recommend zyrtec or claritin because benadryl never stopped making me sleepy even when taking it at night
 back on the zyrtec flonase diet fuck you shit allergies and air change
 true facts i because every christmas she sends me a giant bottle of zyrtec from costco and without it i would die wellmaybe not diepossibly does one die of an itchy face?
 ui guess iull just fucking dieu pt who refused to get her zyrtec rx because uthat shit should be freeu (note copay was 0) whyyourpharmacisthatesyou
 i've never needed benadryl but someone asking for that in norway on reddit provided these answersnif you need it against allergies i would recommend zyrtec against travel sickness marzine as a sleeping aid postafennnprobably similar brands in sweden
 sooo ium about to take my last zyrtec; smmfh this gotta be thee end of thee world; i have got to go to store tomorrow i canut live without ituddude
 understood i carry zyrtec all allergies flare on a plane i would suggest that next time you fly note your sons severe allergies get a docs letter to back it up and ask not to be seated next to any animals as it is a disabling disabling allergies are def noted by an airline
 you can get it anywhere i never had allergies before living in kentucky and now i die all the time itus so much better with xyzal
 you literally just named the one that literally has no affect on me lol i promise you for all the years iuve been alive and all the doctors iuve been to none of those fuckers work on my ass zyrtec would work on and off depending on the pollen count outside udduded
 you know who the biggest asshole on the planet is? this woman in this zyrtec ad who obviously purposefully sneezes whipped cream and snot all over her ucfriendusuc nice previously clean car unless zyrtec stops that behavior itus useless to me  via 
 wrote fuck allergies in the pollen on the hood of my car what a shitty time to run out of zyrtec where did my ancestors live that we didn't develop an immunity to plant dust
 my son loves it amp; the previous cat died badly ( hit by car came home all fucked up  days later son was there when it was put to sleep at the vet) so keeping it for him and stocking up on zyrtec or benadryl i guess
 itus boring compared to melb and syd but definitely not compared to sunshine coast nwell actually ium just looking for a place where there would be less dust mites the allergy is killing me ium having to live on zyrtec very over it i never had it in melbourne
 i take zyrtec and my eyes are never itchy i'm dependent on it now though and if i stop taking it my legs become so itchy i bruise myself in my sleep from scratching i only did that twice and then resigned myself to taking it every single day forever
 how many zyrtec can you take before you die? (asking for a friend)nnman living like prince over herennspring allergyrelief udeuddudcudfudcudfcudcudfudcudf

 what do you take?ni normally use zyrtec doesnut relieve all symptoms but never makes me drowsy but i also use nasal spray and a humidifier when i sleep helps tremendouslyntake this from someone allergic to dogs who just got a dog uddudeni finally feel normal again lol
 zyrtec d hr might be prescription depending on which state youure in only use nasal sprays for short periods body gets addicted to it and can have withdrawal otherwise good sleep and diethydration
 also i think i know why i had that fucked up dream last night when i got home from work yesterday i took xyzal for my allergies which can make you drowsy and before i went to bed without even thinking about it i took zzzquil to help me sleep
 i usually recommend antihistamines without decongestant because if the antihistamine is working you donut need the other component also brand name never needed 
 zyrtec should be non drowsy iuve never had an issue with it making me sleepy itus supposed to last  hours but thatus always questionable lots of people see decreased affect by the end of the day

 ium skeptical of the pharma industry no doubt but the vitriol should be directed to known ineffective remedies like tamiflu rather than scrutinizing a preventive deactivated virus (which as noted above also comes without mercury)
