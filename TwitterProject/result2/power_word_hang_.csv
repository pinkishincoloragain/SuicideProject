 have you considered talking to your pcp about depression? that sounds like the boat i was in back in january and after being on wellbutrin for about  mo now it has drastically changed my mood may be worth considering if you don't know of other ways to resolve stuff?

 ugh that suuuuuucks have you just started taking it? wellbutrin was the biggest game changer of my life tbh the combo of it  lamictal just drastically reduced the intensity of my major depressive episodes and the frequency of my mood swings
 iull fully admit to my subs (my family) that this wellbutrin switch destroyed who i was paxil always helped me enjoy life for the most part with no anxiety less videos and more emptiness came from the switch so officially switching back as of tomo things are going to change
 is that wellbutrin? i tried that once and got super dizzy but it's been a while maybe they've changed it
 prozac celexa wellbutrin etc they cause bizarre behavior irrational thought murder suicide blindness and change of sexual orientation etc nford is lying about it all and congress is to gutless to tell feinstein to kiss their asses

 we also discussed the possibility that the change in behavior though definitely due to the situation we're in may have also been due to the change to his prescription (atm he's taking mg of duloxetine and mg of bupropion wellbutrin)nnhonestly though it's hard to tell

 i took wellbutrin when i quit smoking and i had the craziest dreams it was like i was fifteen again dropping acid and hanging rope swings in the tallest trees
 like according to that test i have the genes that would make it so that i needed a lower dosage of wellbutrin but that hasn't been the case it does stay in my system longer but i need an increased dose to have noticeable changes
 i bet that's part of it i suspect that starting wellbutrin a few years ago kicked it into overdrive though i went  years on t with mild overheating as an issue and then it really ramped up despite my t dose not changing

 i hope the dosage changes does the trick i know we had to fiddle with my dosage of wellbutrin a lot
 mushrooms have never been revelatory for me but i have had at least  lsd experiences that changed me for the better permanently and immediately meanwhile in my adult life i'm on wellbutrin because my bad marriage made me sad and i have no idea if it's doing anything
 i was on ssris for over a decade (from  to about ) when i finally got put on wellbutrin it literally changed my life i finally felt ucnormalud
 omg ium on both zoloft and wellbutrin but only the zoloft changed (from blue to yellow)
 ok if mine changed colors id lose my mind my wellbutrin is constantly shifting from tiny ovals to thick circles to tiny circles itus upsetting
 iuve never had another shape for wellbutrin than ucoff white circle l0ud but my lexapro changed to a blue ovals right before i stopped taking itudeuddd
 maybe hang in for a little longer if you can wellbutrin made me really nauseous for about a week or so but then it was ok (it didn't actually work though so i stopped anyway after a month)
 wellbutrin legit changed my life i can only explain it as giving me mental clarity i didn't even know i was lacking beforehand before i was really just on autopilot and calling that functioning
 my zoloft has stayed pretty much identical the last  years but i've been on wellbutrin like  months and they've changed it twice 
 since i got on wellbutrin it's been a complete change i'm mindblown thinking this is what mentally healthy people feel like all the time? lol
 i had similar exhaustion wfield work the first few months i was on wellbutrin xr one thing that helped mitigate it was drinking a ton of gatorade before taking it in the morning amp; then chugging more duringafter field work hang in there i hope you find something that worksuddudca
 hi vyvanse and wellbutrin saved my life psych meds donut work for everyone and theyure not a miracle cure by any means but they are essential and lifechanging for so many people stop fucking pill shaming )
 irish politics is eternally cursed no point in ever getting your hopes up about change just up the wellbutrin to mg occasionally make a leo meme for online clout
 now i've been on wellbutrin for several years it helps a little with the depression behavioral changes help more but it's done wonders for the anxiety i'm not totally anxiety free but the difference is like night and day thank you for sharing
 swings you should be okay and it can be life changing however if you take those meds and itus too much i have had amazing luck with wellbutrin xrnway more motivation itus maintainable no crash and an overall sense of wellbeingna lil more anxiety but very muted in
 they added a third anti depressant thatus supposed to boost my other antidepressant and now i cannot finish a cigarette and i constantly overachieve it has really made my life so much better itus called wellbutrin itus change my life
 i have mdd and i struggled with the same symptoms my doctor put me on effexor and wellbutrin bc theyure energizing antidepressants my whole life changed loss of interest is a big part of depression get a good psychiatrist itus worth the investment
 yes literally life changing my anxiety stomach is nearly gone iuve had the best results with wellbutrin xl which slowly releases throughout the day
 good on you wellbutrin changed my life
 i think wellbutrin has changed my taste palettenlookin' at cream cheese and even cheese and feeling nauseousnnlike i recalled the taste and blechnbbq and spicy stuff is still good even if my stomach hates me due stress pains
 not sure if i just needed a higher dose or if it just wasnut for me but i didnut really notice a big change when i was taking them now ium on mg wellbutrin and mg lithium which has been working well for me as long as i donut forget to take it
 also going off of antidepressants can send u through really strong withdrawals amp; itus not worth it compared to my other medicationsu withdrawals lexapro has been the worst bc i had a total personality change amp; i didnut even know why wellbutrin amp; fluoxetine are also not great
 ium personally on wellbutrin for other reasons but it has helped my adhd immensely with little change in personality a friend of mine is on more classic meds he has def changed some heus more confident and less insecure about small stuff cocky sometimes even
 i only take ritalin because i need to see a psychiatrist to change and i haven't had the time (cough the executive function to prioritize it) nntried wellbutrin but it did nothing for me
 second day without wellbutrin in four years my brain feels like scrambled eggs med changes suck 
 ium really sensitive to the flashing lights too  ever since using wellbutrin amp; i guess having my seizure threshold lowered nmake sure to change ur settings so you donut have to deal with auto play uddudcb 
 lexamil was useless for me as well  all of the side effects with no actual effect well done for pushing on to find the thing that works  many many people give up hope before they do i take wellbutrin now and i can honestly say itus changed my life
 for anyone wondering what these are for  i take lithium for bipolar  bupropion (wellbutrin) to raise the baseline of my mood overall and then fluoxetine (prozac) is for my anxiety it took me over  yrs to find the ucperfectud combo but the doses sometimes change )
 i personally experienced bad side effects from a lot of ssrius i also tried sertraline and cymbalta too and had to stop both of those bc of mood changesni take wellbutrin (ndri) and that really helps with motivation amp; depression
 yep been taking them for years wellbutrin they only help so much however doesn't make the bipolar disorder go away you still have changes now normally i would have months between mania and a low swing but being sensitive to energy and the state of things has been making

 i'd say both i actually weaned off wellbutrin earlier this year and it definitely made me feel a little funky but not too bad hang in there beautiful uufe0f
 ium surprised they let you stay on the wellbutrin until now as it is not considered safe for pregnancy or egg retrieval i had to be weaned off prior to trying the moods come and go hang in there
 hang in there it can be hard to get off your meds ium also weaning off wellbutrin and felt funky for a few weeks also; there is no shame in going back on meds if you need it took me a year and a half to figure out the right medication combo
 have you ever tried ketamine treatments? it was life changing for me the wellbutrin will  make you feel off for up to six weeks after finishing your very last dose message me i would love to explain the treatment i got that helped me it really saved my life
 i had some really low lows when i went off my wellbutrin but donut discount the difficulties youuve just been through including moving even positive changes can have a tax on your mental health
 ps are you on wellbutrin bc wellbutrin honest to god changed my life like i still wanna die and canut sleep or eat but only lowkey now lmao
 personally  felt ucbetterud but  feels as close to being ucnormalud as i could be i had been on paxil zoloft and lexapro the year prior to finally switching to wellbutrin all medications have different effects on the brain if youure not feeling a positive change after 
 weed amp; wellbutrin changed my life therapy didnut really help at all i was on mirtazipine but it made me a zombie all day amp; the doctor prescribed it for a xanax addiction iuve never had so idrk weed really helped with nightmares tho  gapabentin as needed

 hey minx iuve heard onoff that you deal with depression iud tried med after nednothing worked then last year i got put on wellbutrin and zoloft serious gamechanger fo me took about a month to really help big difference for me
 the honesttomaker gamechanger for me was finally also addressing the anxiety with a mood stabilizer to compliment the antidepressant and further still when wellbutrin was added to my primary ssri
 it's radically changed my life w wellbutrin
 wellbutrin changed my life good luck but also prepare to be grumpy
 i had the same issue and right around the same age i finally went to my doctor and was diagnosed with depression i was on  different antidepressants before he put me on wellbutrin and that was  years ago and itus been life changing pal the thing is with the medication make
 oof mood med changes can be super hard depending on how your body deals with the change i think when i was starting out with adhd meds my dr put me on wellbutrin  but that med and i don't get along everyone's body and chemical reactions are different
 i take antidepressants mainly the antidepressants that are weight neutral i take wellbutrin and it works with my brain chemistry my appetite has changed drastically for the better i donut eat because ium bored or because ium sad itus been a big motivator for me
 i was on prozac and wellbutrin for a bit and didnut notice much of a change personally and i think iuve been on wellbutrin and zoloft before and i thinkkkk wellbutrin helped a bit then?? with anxiety and adhd?? ni will say that weaning off prozac sucked but wellbutrin was fine
 wellbutrin can be really effective and doesnut have the bad side effects of ssris (iuve been on it twice before really helped me through dark times) nhang in there
 been taking wellbutrin for several years it took about a month to really kick in but iuve been so much more even keel since hang in there
 my partner took wellbutrin and was a wreck if you are stopping make sure you talk to your doc as they donut usually want you going off coldturkey hang in there
 antidepressants are often used to treat some attention issues wellbutrin is incredibly common and attention issues are a common symptoms of depression but if your psychiatrist isnut listening to you then you need to confront them about it and ask for a change or switch drs
 ily ni think that was one of the first ones i tried ages ago which should tell u how well it worked the only ones that iuve really felt a positive change w are wellbutrin and viibryd and ofc ketamine
 i changed my snri (effexor) to a dri (wellbutrin) since i had time and energy after quitting my job i started going to the gym most daysnbut i think what made the difference was the huge reduction in stress and emotional energy of spending so much time at something i hated
 congrats getting out of the circle i had a similar experience going cold turkey off of clonopen zoloft amp; wellbutrin drs would not help me family would not help me i had to try to keep it a secret when my personality started to change they couldnut figure it out duh
 ium on wellbutrin have been for quite some time havenut noticed any change in my sex drive
 day  on wellbutrin and i feel this may be a game changer for me
 i was so close to getting wellbutrin and my dr changed her mind at the last second

 i have  really bad anxiety but turns out it was because i was struggling to pay attention and caused a lot of social anxiety ium on a generic brand of wellbutrin it helps with add and itus completely changed my life

 i definitely found it more useful than strattera the effect is mild but was enough of a boost for me to make healthy changes in my life and not feel so stuck of course i always want more but wellbutrin is still my safe backup plan if all else fails

 dude like a of hours after i took my first wellbutrin my life completely changed i was a former smoker and never adjusted how i dealt with stress so i've been a wreck for years
 up until last month i had no active suicidal thoughts since early graduate school however last month i began to change and adjust medications for my anxiety and depression when i switched to wellbutrin i started to have terrible side effects that week was hell 
 i went off of wellbutrin last week and ium noticing absolutely no change in my quality of focus or attention span lol if anything ium starting to feel less spaceyapparently i was just taking a mood stabilizer for months for shits and gigs so thatus fun big pharma gt;gt;gt;gt;
 totally sucks i've never been able to find any other medication that replicated the miraculous effects of wellbutrin i could write paragraphs on how it changed my life my sons life amp; my moms lifeuntil our hair started falling out now i just use cannabis and it helps a lot
 wellbutrin was also a game changer for me it helps keep me from dipping too low too often and it works wonders for my adhd ium probably twice as competent on it than i am without

 wellbutrin it is an atypical antidepressant and it is clinically described as having far less side effects than ssris the only hang up is that if you are sensitive to caffeine you might not like it
 i'm similaru when i started on wellbutrin i felt significant mood changes within like two days while my psychiatrist (who was also on the same meddose) said it took him  weeks to feel a difference
 for me the first week was the worst it made me groggyfoggy and ruined my libido i could tell some changes but nothing major the dr kept increasing the dose until i was maxed out i got a new dr who switched me to lexapro and wellbutrin which has been so much better for me
 my relationship with my medications and how unhappy i've been with wellbutrin the last lil while it was just a bit too strong and a bit too much for me now but back when i started it genuinely changed and kinda saved my life i'm also in a (weirdly) stable position 
 maybe that will change tomorrow when i call dr wellbutrin did not help
 if you get the change ever switch over wellbutrin literally skyrocketed mine and iuve only been on it for a week
 we discussed changing meds but i like the wellbutrin so we're upping the dosage that and hopefully counseling will help once i get in will start painting again probably this weekend and will start reading again i have a ton of baseball mysteries history  chapter a night

 i actually never knew it was the wellbutrin causing the freaky dreams i thought it was the trazodone i agree it is excellent and going on it was life changing (saving) for me
 but theyuve changed me to zyban (aussie wellbutrin) and thatus been one heck of a ride coming off of my old meds and starting these the panic attacks and crying for no reason is real
 wellbutrin was specifically started because he complained of sedationsleeping all dayno energy uddudeuduufe0fuddudeuduufe0fuddudeuduufe0f ium like med hangover
 it was difficult for the first few weeks while i adjusted to the meds and i had some very weird symptoms once i reached equilibrium it was a huge game changer i take wellbutrin generic and zoloft generic and i notice win hrs if i forgot to take them the irritability
 agree i cannot tolerate ssri (tried several) but wellbutrin was a game changer for me check in with docs regularly until you find what works for you
 it does i take wellbutrin with a lexapro chaser and with therapy and adhdfocused coaching it has been lifechanging
 yup its a common combo one np told me they call it welloft my dosage changes every now amp; then but i cant live without it (ive been off it a few times all terrible) the zoloft makes my depression and anxiety manageable amp; the wellbutrin gives me the boost to actually do shit

 that sucks ( i was just on wellbutrin  for about a month but i still had lots of downs so we added the abilify to stabilize that wellbutrin has helped a little with the adhd problems but not enough to make a real difference yet so weure upping it to see if that changes 
 iuve never tried prozac but zoloft made me completely lifeless and i gained so much weight ium on wellbutrinit didnut change me besides killing my appetite and giving me a lil energy and motivation to go abt my life and when i get depressed i physically cannot go as deep into
 in honor of my psychiatrist putting me back on wellbutrin hereus the handy guide to seizure first aid that now has to hang on our fridge uddudc 
 the way my psychiatristus office na) didnut call to set up a follow up like normalnb) changed the policy without any notice that i can no longer get a refill even with an appointment on the schedulenni feel like shit i want my wellbutrin back
 iuve been taking wellbutrin for almost  years and it works really well for me we had to work my way up to a higher dose and add another type of antidepressant but after finding the right combo my life has totally changed
 i have very severe depression i had to change my medication several times i now take the max dose of wellbutrin and a small dose of lexapro as well itus definitely helped but my doctors told me you just have to keep trying different things to find the right meds for you
 never tried wellbutrin lexapro or celexa did the trick i was tweaking the first  weeks and then after felt unusually happy it changed my life wellbutrin is a strange one for depression id go with the ssris ( selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor)
 have you ever tried trintellix? i been taking it for  months and it's been great on my anxiety and depression i was a lexapro and wellbutrin forever at max dose and just wasn't working later found out i can't process lexapro sometimes change is good uufe0f
 an artist i follow on here said she started wellbutrin recently and it changed her sleeping schedule all around but thatus the only side effect iuve heard about it
 now that the weather is changing i lowered my prozac and upped my wellbutrin i've communicated with my drs every step of the way and we've found the best path forward for me i know i'm lucky in this respect amp; i also know i'm a good self advocate which is a skill but i'm so
 i have meds for when things are bad kitten dying ex harassing etc  but i use them rarely nnthis level of anxiety isnut bad enough to solve with meds  itus just enough to procrastinate tasks but i can push through it nni wish my doctor would change me to wellbutrin
 oh no i love acid but eek i was put on antid's way before my bp dx amp; was manic for years wo ever knowing a gp gave me zoloft amp; my abusive spouse wouldn't have noticed if i lost a limb let alone had behavioral changes i was on wellbutrin to quit smoking too that was wild
 it depends many anti depressants have side effects for the first two to six weeks however if they are something you can't live with change them asap i tried wellbutrin mentally i felt amazing but i was also sweating like i was exercising  which was socially unacceptable
 ok after changing your wellbutrin dose did anyone else have weird appetite changes?
 iuve taken wellbutrin for almost a decade i started on a low dose as a smoking cessation aid that didnut work but i noticed a change in my mood and motivation level so we tried a therapeutic dose for depression never looked back
 wellbutrin is a good drug and may may not be the cause of your head ache hang in there
 iuve been on a few different kinds of meds but as far as antidepressants go i didnut gain or lose anything udeuddudcudffcuduufe0f iuve been on lexaprocipralex pristiq effexor wellbutrin and prozac and no changes
 i have mild bpd and i take lamotrigine as a mood stabilizer and itus been life changing but the wellbutrin made it all worse for me udduded i hope you find what works for you mama itus a process and sometimes it gets worse before it gets better but itus worth it
 ium on wellbutrin biggest change is that ium able to actually start a project which is usually the hardest part my focus is still eh
 have had  calories today most of which were at around am roughly  and by and large still fill full suspect it's a result of serotonin level changes but was already on wellbutrin (mg daily) and lexapro (mg daily) curious if interaction
 wellbutrin changed my life  period
 my doctor added wellbutrin on top of my ssrinnit's been less than a week but the only changes so far have been i had a lot of energy one morning and now every night i have a really low moodnnv cool thank u
 i smoked for over  yrs i quit  years ago i still crave one every so often too  i take wellbutrin everyday for depression i think that helps alot i'd quit before a few times and went back after a few months when i wasnt taking wellbutrin  hang in there you can do it
 i will never forget the interview i had with late actor jim varney who told me that wellbutrin saved and changed his life he had been depressed his whole life and was afraid medication would diminish his creativity it made his life worth living
 i ghosted my psychiatrist so now ium having wellbutrin withdrawals but i refuse to change uddudeuddudeuddude
 i have been on wellbutrin for about  weeks and the fog is finally lifting amp; i feel like myself again therapy has been good for me but these meds have been life changing all that to say fuck depression itus a liar
 maybe the doses need changed? or maybe as youud brain chemistry has continued to change you now require something new? i know i used to be on zoloft and had to switch to wellbutrin which made a big difference sometimes itus about just finding what fits best
 you hang in there little one i take wellbutrin it has helped me but it took a few times to get what works for me one day at a time  
 depressed dudes don't lift as i have learnt but i recall how truly magical my first lift after my longest depressive episode was here early  in texas wellbutrin was beginning to make changes  
 prozacwellbutrin is not the first med regimen i have tried for my mental health i've switched exact meds andor changed dosages of meds (always with a doctor's help) several times i refused a med a psychiatrist prescribed once because i didn't like the side effects that's ok
 honestly  if youure going cold turkey youure likely to fail ntry zyban  actually wellbutrin is the generic form and much cheaper nhighly effective at suppressing urge to smoke nwhile youure on it change up your patterns of behaviour nand lastly donut give up if  when you slip
 i donut have a dick but i have experienced lack of sex drive and never being wet wellbutrin changed this for me have you done gene testing yet? 
 i really struggle with depression and anxiety amongst other things and wellbutrin has changed my life the side effects starting were brutal though i feel energized and happy i have that reward sensation back and things feel good again rather than me just being apathetic
 i got a massive unexpected  a few days after my wedding which was legit the happiest day of my life fortunately i'd learned to recognize it thanks to a bunch of therapy amp; reached out to my psych amp; therapist before i self destructed they got me on wellbutrin lifechanging
 he says that remeron increases your appetite but doesn't change your metabolism so if you can keep yourself from eating more you won't gain weight except that i was on wellbutrin an appetite suppressant before so it's not like i was eating a normal amount
 itus been  weeks of me on  mg of prozac with  mg of wellbutrin legit nothing has changedmaybe i should try  of wellbutrin uddudec if it doesnut make me lose my shit
 so i was in prozac and wellbutrin but didnut see a difference but once i changed to zoloft iuve noticed a difference
 i added wellbutrin onto my effexor several months back didnut personally notice any changes (so eventually will be switching to something else) amp; have no dizziness symptoms at all your mileage may vary though
 the dizziness for me isnut extreme iuve been taking wellbutrin for  years i take mg once a day start your dose low and see how it goes i mostly get dizzy if i donut eat enough because it can restrict your appetite i love wellbutrin and it changed my life
 i was on citalopram alone which was ok and after a couple years they added wellbutrin and it helped it seems to boost the effectiveness and even it all out all subjective of course but there was some dizziness at start (and at any dose change) but it went away quickly
 i've not taken wellbutrin but i started taking lexapro (thanks ) and it's been a game changer no ill side effects
 wellbutrin has been fine for me i take it in conjunction with celexa no side effects but i donut feel like itus been lifechanging in terms of its effectiveness
  i regret having let a change of provider lead me to switching to effexor ( but i changed jobs and insurance the effexor on its own left me feeling mothballed and almost comatose so we added wellbutrin and it was ok but
 has anyone stayed on the same psych meds for a long time without issue? i find myself changing my anxiety medication once i hit the dosage limit but iuve been on wellbutrin for  years and i think itus still working?
 wellbutrin is some amazing shit girl that stuff has changed my life
 brains suck wellbutrin made me irrationally angry but itus a complete game changer for my wife i do hope you find a solution if nothing else maybe benadryl?
 but theyuve changed me to zyban (aussie wellbutrin) and thatus been one heck of a ride coming off of my old meds and starting these the panic attacks and crying for no reason is real
 started taking mine around midnight after changed the time of taking hers it has made the world of difference lexapro and zyban
 ium allergic to zyban and chantix doesnut do a thing ium impressed youuve done this well hang on ueufe0f
 honestly  if youure going cold turkey youure likely to fail ntry zyban  actually wellbutrin is the generic form and much cheaper nhighly effective at suppressing urge to smoke nwhile youure on it change up your patterns of behaviour nand lastly donut give up if  when you slip
 i took a lexapro generic for a while and didn't like iteventually changed to something else i think wellbutrin (which i liked) lexapro made me feel weird as hell tho personally
 i'm so glad the wellbutrin is working for you i take that daily and add adderall on work days it's been an absolute life changer uufe0f
 i suffer from major depression too donut let it get to you fact is some days just suck; just gotta hang in there till you get to the other side wellbutrin is a wonderful drug too helps make things betternndonut ever let anyone (especially yourself) tell you youure ()
 some drug rep told them this once and they keep repeating it it seems i remember i being crossovered to wellbutrin every single time my doc changed my ssri these people aren't trained to see that is only going to disrupt the system more
 i am on paxil and wellbutrin but i am talking to my doctor tomorrow about changing it i def dont want any more drinks tho after all the vomiting i was doing
 wellbutrin literally changed my life
 ium on wellbutrin it was life changing honestly
 it's a weird drug for sure i was given it to boost my wellbutrin hang in there it takes awhile to get it right
 i was also on wellbutrin so the thanksgiving hangover was truly a catastrophe my niece and nephew witnessed this low my sister laughed at me while my mom did the irish thing you know ignore the obvious
 wellbutrin makes me hella mean so i gotta change it
 do you have you taken them in combo? how was that?nhave you used wellbutrin? (ium quitting smoking again lol next month amp; i know itus used for cessation)ndid you gain or lose weight or experience other physical changes?nhow were the withdrawals if you stopped?
 but a couple of months ago added wellbutrin and boy the change in my motivation and depression was instant nnbefore wellbutrinnnever worked outnoverate hourly and dailyncouldn't keep a regular schedulencouldn't get work donenliterally watched tv  hours a day
 i dont think that's true i take wellbutrin and concerta and find they synergize hard to change a doctor's mind with anecdotal evidence though sorry you're dealing with this
 is the wellbutrin hitting after less than a week even tho they said it takes  week to build in your system? is it the placebo effect? is it the change in the pharmamanufacturer for my generic adderall that's giving me more energy and mowing down the rage i had? adhdtwitter
 hang in there tomorrow is always a better day if you ever need to talk about meds (i'm on lexapro and wellbutrin for anxiety and depression) just dm me i will help if i can
 my psychiatrist gave me low dose wellbutrin to counteract this and tbh it changed my life libido x higher than it was before i got on lexapro
 wellbutrin worked for me  it kept the cravings at bay while i learned to change my habits
 wellbutrin helped me lose  lbs in a month but also gave me mega anxiety like a panic attack because somebody changes the plans in a not serious way or freaking out due to sensory issues a lot so be careful b
 i currently donut take anything alongside the wellbutrin not sure if thatull change in the future tho and oh man good luck i hope you get the help you need uddudcb
 iuve been on wellbutrin for a few years now and itus been a game changer for the best
 i take the lowest dose of lexapro combined with wellbutrin and that combination has been the best for me so far buspar has worked well in the has too regularly engaging in some form of mindfulness activity has been life changing as well
 wellbutrin changed my life this summer in fact my car died today and it took a dozen calls and  hours to get it towednormally that would've had me in the fetal in tears like it's the end of the world it was annoying but i handled it without one tear shed cheers to us
 no hate towards lamictalnshit is a game changernso is the wellbutrin and gabapentin
 i ran out of my wellbutrin and never got it refilled and now i donut want to kill myself when ium drunk or coked out so this is an interesting change
 wellbutrin makes a hangover feel like ium having withdrawal from mth
 day  of wellbutrin changed my life forever fist bump
 i'd look into wellbutrin or straterra wellbutrin is used off label for adhd and its weight neutral i know weight change can happen with adhdh and qntideppression meds straterra has helped me pull out of early episodes for that reason
 wellbutrin was a game changer for me  i'm a big fan of it hope your new med combo works
 lamictal and wellbutrin xl really saved me theyre life changing a as much as i hate medication
 ah to be normcore mentally ill instead of hanging out w the shadow people thinkinf abt blood and having the fun slurs racing in my head the moment i wake up to post an inspirational story about how wellbutrin really worked for me and im  im normal now
 iuve been on wellbutrin for years and am finally changing my prescription as of tomorrow what does it all mean
 hmmm apparently i grind my teeth a lot which predates the wellbutrin for me the biggest thing was just the change in appetite
 hard to say for certain bc there were other factors like changing birth control and drinking but for me prozac and wellbutrin helped me lose cymbalta amp; zoloft i gained and effexor was neutral i also reacted poorly to the ones i gained on so it coulduve been comfort eating
 i donut even know if the one i was on (wellbutrin) was working for me because the doctor had no idea what he was doing and wouldnut slowly change my meds so i altering like four at a time but i got very irritableaggressive even though my normal disposition is very passive
 it makes you more mellow or steady like no ups and downs  i was on paxil for  years and it was time for a change and switched to wellbutrin since it worked better for adhd  my moods are good but my anxiety is a little worse since quitting paxil
 i got more brain zaps from other meds not as much wellbutrin till i was withdrawaling  but they only last a few days just try to hang in there and drink lots of water to try to flush your system
 okay im replying to two of ur tweets without following u i fee like this is weird but anyway i have a major monodepressive disorder and im on mg of wellbutrin and i must say it gives me extra energy but it doesn't really change how depressed i am generally so it's okay?
 hah you're changing adhd meds too huh? my doc's having me try straterra this next month after a few months on wellbutrin
 oh yea they are always telling me that certain drugs change the serum levels of other drugs but never seem to adjust thingsexcept i just started wellbutrin and that has to be carefully monitored because of my cyclic vomiting (which apparently changes how it works)
 well shit uufe0f he swore by what the zyban did for him but honestly i think the key was changing all the behavior associated with smoking he was lucky enough to have a month off (vacay amp; personal time etc) and we just altered everything we could his st cig of the day was
 talk to your doctor my husband smoked for  yrs until he was diagnosed with emphysema he couldn't succeed then he had no choice a combination of zyban change of routine amp; a nicotine sub let him quit it's been  yrs now he has copd you don't want to go there trust me
  one day at a timen pick an aid gum lozenges zyban patches whatever they'll help a lotn keep something in your hands pen pencil carrotsn for me the first  days were the worst it's still hard after that for a while but you can do it hang in there
 yes  thatus what i was trying to say too  (was also widowed and thought i might as well be dead too but many years and some prescription wellbutrin later everything changed for the better)
 hey ik itus scary but once you find the right one they can be really helpful ium on wellbutrin (?) i think and have been for a few months they give you more mental energy they donut change much about you at all i promise )
 i found no change in my sex drive honestly probably improved it i find that i donut dream as often honestly and reading that guys comment made me realize itus probably bc of wellbutrin but i havenut had any terrible stuff the withdrawals are horrible tho
 my cobra runs out on  dec (which will change as i will be going back to work now that stimulus has passed) at any rate i was looking at goodrx for script refills for my wellbutrin you can find some cheap meds there to tide you over until you get your insurance resolved
 i was on zoloft for almost  years and i finally realized i was so numbed out and exhausted and down wellbutrin seems to be the change i neededuium hoping it sticks feels like i am genuinely seeing the world in color lol glad you found what was right for you as well uddudcc
 wellbutrin didnut work for me but itus so important to highlight how everyone is different and everyone can find help it took me years to find medication that helped but once i did it was life changing literally
 just keep taking lus now we know something we never would have and she wrongudeuddudeudd she needs some wellbutrin po thang
 ium currently on wellbutrin sertraline lamotrigine gabapentin vyvanse and trazodone for sleepu sometimes you need a cocktail and even then itus not enough lmao i see my psych on monday to change them up again
 im like confident he will because its literally just wellbutrin and my meds have been the same for like  months and arent going to change next time i see him? but also if he doesnt just lol me i guess
 when i was taking wellbutrin it knocked my alcohol tolerance to the floor like one cocktail four cocktails lotta bang for my buck but drinking on wellbutrin also jacked my heart tf up and gave me panic attacks in the hangover
 added wellbutrin to my prozac about a year ago and it was a lifechanger good stuff when it works hope it's positive for you
 so sorry to hear getting off andor changing medication is a big project and a very stressful onenn(i just got off wellbutrin after  yrs)
 so the doc gave me wellbutrin in a very small dose i started taking it without changing my behavior at all and basically just stopped smoking without noticing it took about a month if i remember right and i stopped taking the med maybe a month later that was '0 uddude0a
 i started years ago with strat it was fine initially the desired effect wo any unwanted  yr later my bp was uddude mouth like if l had not sandwhich but sand paper  doc changed to wellbutrin which has been fine for yrs now but yes strat was great for st yr yr  rgds
 itus gr the fact that ium taking less of my wellbutrin and it didnut even change to the extended release version is literally making me feel like ium insane
 are you still loopy from the new meds?the dr tried to change my meds to wellbutrini lost my mindor what was left of ituddude0
 also i think my meds have stopped working amp; i'm back to manic mood swings amp; trouble sleeping who knew my body would somehow build tolerance to my meds in less than two weeks especially to the same med (wellbutrin) that actually at least changed my mood somewhat by the nd week
 the least they could do is include a yearus supply of wellbutrin for everyone in this stimulus bc weure all hanging on by a thread amiright girls
 since adding wellbutrin to my strattera i have actually created a habit of changing washing my face and cleaning the cat cage before i sit down to eat and relax for the night small victories feels like winning a battle
 paxil is no fun to stop either when i changed docs after changing states my new doc had me switch to wellbutrin at a relatively high dose to counter the lack of paxil that worked fortunately
 googled and apparently wellbutrin can change how things taste so this wasn't as dumb as it sounds still a little dumb
 i should also mention my doctor hesitated at first to prescribe wellbutrin because my brain mri had some tflair lesions she was worried there could be something there that would increase risk of seizures but so far so good  mg per day of wellbutrin xr never changed it
 happy  months to taking wellbutrin it has truly changed my life in such a positive way and allowed me to make changes that i never thought possible
 iuve only been on strattera for  weeks so she wants me to try to ride it out until my appointment at the end of the month to see if there is any change there is also the possibility of just upping my existing dose of wellbutrin if this doesnut work  so weull see
 wellbutrin is one of they gentler ones with few side effects itus meant to not be a jarring behavioral change but sometimes that makes it hard to realize that itus working because you feel better without noticing
  wellburtinnnmy doctor prescribed  milligrams of wellbutrin or bupropion twice a day and a month later i had the libido of an yearold boy  i just got a little trimmer without changing my diet or exercisingnnapparently it makes you hornier happier and slimmer 
 sending you uddudc i just started wellbutrin which seems to be helping but itus such a a crap shoot and the lag time in meds working can be frustrating hope it all levels out soon for you hang in there youure not aloneuddudc
 if itus of any consolation to you someone near and dear to me didnut feel like wellbutrin was a good fit for herself either meanwhile lexapro has been a wonderful fit for herugenuinely lifechanging i wish you the absolute best of luck
 hang in there girl keep trying different things until something works for you i was on prozac and had heartburn and nightterrors every night for years went to zoloft and felt meh now on lexaprowellbutrin itus a long journey but once you find the right combo itus worth it
 wellbutrin plus melatonin hangover is like being awake but asleep at the same time
 if itus worth anything wellbutrin changed my life i knew it was working because i was able to clean my apartment for the first time in the  years iud lived therei never knew that being productive was supposed to make you feel good before i started taking it
 i need a medication change or addon or smth bc my depression  fatigue are incapacitating i'd be open to increasing my wellbutrin dose or trying dexedrine again there are no more antidepressants for me to try or else i'd want that
 iuve reversed my stance on subbing to friends ofs due to recent changes (taking hrny juice every morning aka wellbutrin) which of you sluts is on there other than samm
 yuall literally canut tell me wellbutrin isnut at least  magic   i literally just cleaned the base boards on a wednesday night and iuve done two loads of laundry and changed the sheets  neurotypical me would just be too powerful
 lemme seennxmg progesteronenxmg estradiolnxmg vyvansenxmg wellbutrinnxmg naprixinnxmg claritin nxmg benadrylnnso  i also have a tylenol prescription nncurrently out of the last two until i see an immunologist but assuming they won't change anything
 starting wellbutrin has actually helped me a lot i donut think iuve accepted how much of a toll depression takes on me so getting some of it alleviated is a nice change 
 i was on the max dose of wellbutrin for six months and i felt literally no change on it i can't fathom what kind of a high one could possibly get from it so unhorny that you achieve nirvana?
 wellbutrin is a game changer
 being treatment resistant is the worst ni am now seriously considering giving the spravato a shot the last antidepressant i tried was lexapro and it did help for a few mons now ium on wellbutrin ium on month  and no changes yet uddude
 luckily my adhd generic has stayed consistent but my wellbutrin changes pretty often i hate to open the bottle and see a certain shape of pill
 wellbutrin xl has been great for me personally and gently nudges one towards a better baseline nnas with many antidepressants your energy and motivation will increase before your thought patterns changennso expect an initial rough patch and be prepared to ask for help
 letus normalize it uufe0fnni was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder in  and i started taking celexa i switched to wellbutrin last month these medications have been life changing if you canut make your own neurotransmitters store bought is perfectly fine

 wellbutrin branch of the antidepressants gang checking in nnagree it's tough to admit you can't go it alone and need help but life changing when you get it
 effexor and paxil were pure evil to me wellbutrin and seroquel has changed my life for the better in many unforseen ways
 i canut remember if i mentioned this on here but i started taking a low dose of wellbutrin recently to see if it helped with what my doc amp; i are pretty sure are adhd symptoms i didnut think thereud been much change but apparently (i just realized) i havenut taken it in  days
 take wellbutrin and then drink caffeine lol itull change your life uddude0
 i was tired of antidepressants they never help and the side affects suck i'd only tried ssris though and when i told my doc the side affects were a nonstarter (particularly weight andor libido changes) she suggested wellbutrin i'd say it's worth talking to your gp about
 wellbutrin isn't an ssri though it's an ndri (something something dopamine) i have adhd and depression and ssris never helped me at all (obvs just my experience but i don't think that's super unusual) wellbutrin has actually made a really positive change for me though
 y'all can't hang with the wellbutrin gang uddude0e
 hang on i'm  months on depression is better anxiety is lifting but im fatigued constantly the common options are to up dose or add wellbutrin to combat the sleepiness
 so i had a med change from zoloft to wellbutrin and uhhhhhh i feel ium disassociating ? is this normal?
 wellbutrin worked well for me though tms was the most effective for me episodes are much shorter and i have more self control changed my life
 i use medication changes like oh covid started right after i started taking wellbutrin
 hang in there i relapsed over the summer on opiates after nearly  years away had a horrific reaction to zyban i took to stop smoking amp; that led to it just finished  days in treatment amp; itus never too late for a fresh start
 i smoked  strong hand rolled smokes a day for  years i got zyban tablets from doctor and stopped st time you take  tablets a day for  days and keep smoking on day  you stop they changed my life see if you can get some

 claritin worked for me for years but then i had to switch to zyrtec after awhile your body gains a resistance and you have to change it up bonus if you had motion sickness or fall asleep from nonnarco medications neither of those will be a problem anymore after a while

 zyrtec before bed every night also as soon as you come in from outside change your clothes and wash(or at least rinse) your face hands and arms wonut solve it completely but will take the edge off

 yea it sucks but if u start taking it every day youull notice a difference (zyrtec amp; claritin) your body gets use to the sprays so youull have to change brands every couple of months (flonase and nasacort are my go tous) doc told me thereus a lot more pollen in the air than usual
 aw jr this reply makes me miss hanging out with you so muchni don't have any idea what it means thoughni did learn today from my pcp that it's built on a zyrtec base which i hadn't paid attention to before (levocetirizine vs cetirizine)

 not a physician or medical anything so please take this with a shaker full of salt but flonase sensimist zyrtec were a game changer

 that's a great idea i do a basic antihistamine that's worked before but you build up immunity to anything  i'm going to get flonase tomorrow thank you both so much  maybe zyrtec too to try to change it up???

 the mother did not give the child tamiflu as outlined in her original post in the fb groupnnyou might want to change your name as disinformation is all you do
 quite disingenuous these doctors give no care or consideration to individuals amp; families harmed by vaccines or tamiflu they donut admit there are grieving folks who previously held happy laughing babies in their arms amp; are forced to drastically change lives amp;beliefs in medicine
 i always always get a flu shot because i have a compromised immune system and would be hit very hard if exposed  my grandsons got influenza b a couple of weeks ago so i took tamiflu for  days  still hanging in
 oh no feel better soon get tamiflu if itus the flu hang in there
 according to facebook screenshots she never gave the tamiflu she changed her story to cover her embarrassment and get money from gullible people like you udeudd
 i actually didnt take tamiflu just supportive care ium not sure what that would change it certainly wouldnut cause the damage that the fluus known tonncoughyou know like kill kids who whacky antivaxxers like to play doctor withcough nsorry thatus the adult onset asthma
 i mean that's like saying aspirin penicillin and cholesterol meds are placebo the range of their effectiveness doesn't make it 0 but how effective definitely changes from person to person but children definitely stand a better chance with tamiflu then nothing
 i'm not talking about uncomfortable side effects i'm talking about neuropsychiatric changes and sudden death from tamiflu it is not harmless or helpful 
 we are in atlanta and my son has gotten the flu  starting tamiflu called american airlines to change our flight to make sure he is afebrile  hoursthey state we wonut wave the change fee because it is ucnot a critical illnessud flucankill
 and of course she changed her story when the boy died and she can now been held liable she posted the blow by blow series of events on social media and we actually followed what happened she outright said she wasnt giving tamiflu she was trying to treat her kids with herbs
 or she changed her mind and decided to use the tamiflu she had  boys  the youngest ( months) was the sick one the yearold  had just had dinner and taken a bath with his older brother and then collapsed he died  days later in the hospital 
 how can you know if it was the tamiflu for sure? thirtysix hours of no treatment can produce huge changes too
 strange that before the fact in the facebooks screenshots she says she never even picked up the tamiflu nnsounds like shes changing the story to avoid criminal charges for not following medical advice
 you seem to ignore that  came after  you seem to ignore that the who having downgraded the tamiflu from the essential drugs list in  means they learnt something after  that changed their understanding but ium the one with lack of reading comprehension ok
 i donut think she has rumor has it sheus changed her story amp; saying she did give tamiflu nno doubt this was a tragedy on her part i would have more empathy for her if she just owned upudhey yuall i made a mistakeud
 she said she didnut pick up the tamiflu sounds like her story changes cya anyone?
 my point is that of you're trying to avoid febrile seizures you need medication to bring down the fever tamiflu (problematic for reasons that are irrelevant to my point right now) is not a fever reducer and would not have changed the outcome if he died from febrile seizures
 oh jesus i had that happen but with tamiflu for my toddler hang in there
 tamiflu (an antiviral) is not interchangeable with nsaidus like tylenol and motrin uceven if she didnut do the tamiflu she was alternating tylenol amp; motrinud is an incoherent statement they are different categories of medicine
 true i can understand how tamiflu might be scary i can even understand thinking ucwell maybe he doesnut need itud i just donut understand why she waited so long to take him back to the er then she makes a gofundme completely changing her story the whole thing is weird
 if they really start showing symptoms it would just be cheaper to buy tamiflu over the counter thatus all the doctor would be able to give them anyway hang in there mamaudduded
 yes  tragedy brings on the retrospectroscope to everything you did (do we know for certain she didn't?)nnif i were the ed doc i would tell her the futility of blaming herself because tamiflu wouldn't have changed the course in patient with no comorbidity (her son)
 amazing how drastically her story changed once the press attention hit amp; she launched gofundme that blessed child should have been vaccinated it might have guven him at least some protection she should have given the tamiflu immediately as prescribed you can't rewrite death
 this kids parents did the shot and tamiflu  did it change anything?  stop pretending that these meds and shots are effective at anything  they arenut 
 tamiflu works but it's not going take away all the symptoms nor work for everyonenn it worked great for my daughter amp; wife nnbut we're just going round amp; round hereand not looking to change so this ends here
 how can some people be that gullible and believe all those conspiracy theories about vaccins climate change and so on poor little heart is gone because of those stupid moronsthey are criminals and they should pay for it i can't udeuddcudeuddcudeuddcudeuddcudeuddc
 what about all those i posted above that died after taking tamiflu? do they not count? changing the narrative from dies of flu to dies from not taking tamiflu in the face of current whistleblower lawsuit seems suspect 
 this is where we need to change the conversation when parents are taking medical advice from people online it's gotten this badnnboy  dies of flu after antivaxxers told mother not to use tamiflu  
 no it was parental neglect because she didnut give him the tamiflu prophylactic that the er doctor had prescribed she didnut pick the prescription up stop trying to change the facts of this story
 this is terrible  please please please do not take any medical advice from anyone except a licensed medical professional  you see stuff like this in the ms world too do not make any changes to your healthcare regimen without consulting your doctor 
 i'm  provax but even when my fluvaxxed kids have tested  for flu their docs didn't prescribe tamiflu because they doubted the benefit vs side effectsthe mother's instincts notwithstanding i don't think we can know for a fact that tamiflu would have changed the outcome
 change in behavior can be associated with symptoms of the influenza amp; while the patient may be on tamiflu there is no proven association that the behavioral change is contributed to by the tamiflu
 i mean she apparently told cbs she gave the medicine prescribed but posted on facebook she didnut? so who knows i said before tamiflu probably wouldnut have saved him anyway but it doesnut change the fact that those antivax loons are on the internet telling her to use potatoes
 the flu is like a zombie virus it takes over your cells and turns them into like cells essentially changing them all into flu cells  i was cookin  lol  tamiflu sucked but udeuddudcudffcuduufe0f it gave me relief around  h and that was great
 i agree  but also wanna add tamiflu does not directly treat the flu virus and is not necessary to take when diagnosed tamiflu has also been found to show neurological changes  specifically suicidal thoughtsideation in short donut doubt doctors but also trust your body 
 this doesnut change the fact that vaccines are toxic and tamiflu is horrible drug and remember you canut patent (make tons of money) nature so it will be demonized by the msm until jesus comes back alsoyouull never hear all the stories of ppl who died from the shottamiflu
 well tamiflu is much better than what antivaxx says if the efficacy of tamiflu is not good enough then visit the doctor you have right to know and a chance to change the medicine
 i just saw someone reference the tamiflu debate and i don't know what that means but i do know tamiflu has been the biggest factor in changing panleukopenia survival rates from  to  at the rescue
 the side effects for tamiflu are really wild especially in children ucextreme aggression and self harmud are some of them unless thatus changed since i last looked i def encourage people to ask their dr for a different medication but not a fucking berry from the bush wtf
 corrected? by who? has she changed her original statements regarding tamiflu?  nium not dunking this is what antivax mentality leads to ni do feel for the mother i think she was taken advantage of by larry cook amp; friends for her other kids sakes i hope she learns from this
 if you look at the screenshot it says that they can develop a change in behaviour and nervous system problems that can lead to death not that tamiflu does that
 ium not even convinced tamiflu would have changed things but it is better than a fucking potato
 i mean i donut think tamiflu would necessarily have changed things but itus gotta be better than fucking potatoes
 the natural cures are bunk but the tamiflu likely wouldnut have changed the outcomes itus bunk for its own reasons
 i am provaccine tamiflu is next to useless they definitely tell you not to get your hopes up that it will actually help it's very sad that her son died but also extremely unlikely that tamiflu would have changed the outcome
 with more and more people getting flu shots and tamiflu  how come the numbers are largely unchanged?  maybe they have no impact at alluddude
 wonut it change whether or not you prescribe tamiflu?

 the same day wuhan union hospital released an updated medication guideline for anyone with pneumonia moxifloxacin (an antibiotic) and umifenovir (an antiviral) on top of the oseltamivir (generic tamiflu) zhang had already been prescribed

 is the idea that tamiflu works? a ucflu shotud is the treatment you mean? please billions want to know about the treatments you say are ignored ium getting tired of this but still trying to change just one mind
 there will almost certainly be a tamiflu type drug that could be similarly used for covid in the very near future this could be a game changer 
 no it doesnut but it does free up a test for someone with no explanation for their critical illness you can still take precautions without a test (they are the same for flu and covid) the management is the same too (tamiflu is garbage) how would your management change? 
 how to treat an illness is constantly evolving with new info if i get coronavirus i will stay in bed and drink fluidsnnwith respiratory distress i will take tamiflu hydroxychloroquine and zpack along with an inhaler and oxygennninfo changes daily so consult your doctor 
 hang in there abbs it'll be okay i promise i said the same thing just kick its but while you can i'm surprised they didn't prescribe you any tamiflu
 chloroquine could be a curative drug (wait and see) however this is probably not effective for prophylaxy (remember tamifluhn) and could be dangerous and induce change viral outcome please advert 
 i too got the flu super bowl week took tamiflu and it still kicked my ass i was just feeling good and this damn thing rest is hard for me right now i hope it changes
 i remember swine flu very well i caught it then took the tamiflu antidote it caused a swelling of the membranes of my brain i have been epileptic ever since it changed my life in ways i could not have imagined nstay at home stay safe
 throw a few different antivirals at the covid  virus and see what happensnif tamiflu can provide relief yearly on an ever changing virus isn't it possible that an antiviral already in existence can be useful?

 i'm most hopeful about finding an effective treatment there are various cocktails of existing medication that look very promising and are beginning large scale trials as we speak if we can find a 'tamiflu' for covid that could change the game while we wait for a vaccine
  weure trying to be as judicious as possible so people who most need med resources can get themnnif you are angry about not getting an influenza swab itus bcnit may not change decision makingnyou donut qualify for tamiflu anywaynweure already at high flu levelsnfew swabs 
 his summary doesn't include alternative treatmentuofflabel drugs new or offlabel antivirals that are found effective etc no fault twitter requires brevity but i'm thinking of how tamiflu has changed flu treatment if we find that things get easier
 funny ive had the flu several times in my life and i don't think ive ever once been tested for it doesnt really change the treatment or prognosis just lots of fluids and tamiflu
 coronavirus nfriend has the symptoms of the virus kaiser put her on tamiflu until her flu test came back negativebut they are refusing to test her for the coronavirus because the treatment would not change even after nd trip to the er wtf??? andshe's a nurse
 tamiflu does not get rid of it it might lesson some symptoms and flu strands are always changing so sometimes the vaccine doesn't work
 my bet is that something like tamiflu will be effective against it and will bring down death rate to a level as other flu like viruses this would be a game changer and we will love with covid like we life with influenza today curious to see how the willigness to vac will be
 i had flu last month used telemedicine to get tamiflu stayed home ten days nearly went in for three days of wheezing but it ended that day my symptoms in hindsight are spot on for wuhan absolutely nothing would have changed had it been
 yep my youngest had the exact symptoms of cv high fever dry cough and runny nose took tamiflu nothing changed  we had to go back this week and got more medicine for sinusitis could have beenbe cv who really knows?
 tamiflu is fine and has few side effects this drug isnut an antiviral itus an immunemodulating agent that changes the way your body reacts to different cells
 i suppose  weeks of running fevers having chillsoverheating coughing fits sneezing fits and migraine headaches is less likely to be from pollenallergies?nnjust finished a weeklong tamiflu course too no change
 why do people need a test to confirm? if you have the symptoms assume you have it testing doesnut change treatment protocol there is (obviously) no prescription treatment like tamiflu for this thing take tylenol and otc meds for symptoms and stay home
 right  my client who came in with the flu and pneumonia is getting out of the hospital tomorrow  i haven't asked if they tested her and changed the diagnosis but i was given tamiflu to ward off a full blown case of influenza not to protect me from covid
 there is one more element we shouldnut forget since this is a new strain there are no therapeutics ie tamiflu so the virus must run itus full course this will change when medicines are developed which could speed recovery times
 i definitely got a strong case of the flu earlier this year even with the flu shot hang in there if itus early enough ask your doctor for tamiflu
 no lmao i have the flu and covid is not the flu there are no vaccines for flu and itus changing too rapidly to pinpoint and no one has immunity to it nor are there treatments like how tamiflu treats flu 
 you have to test for the specific rna of this virus itus called a pcr test nnthe flu has a vaccine and tamiflu to help stop the virus humans have never seen this virus so thereus nothing we can do to stop it other than behavioral changes like hand washing
 uhhh influenza a is not a common cold the common flu doesnut make you wish you were dead and i had a flu shot and tamiflu itus also highly contagious i would know i got and sick by hanging around them before i even knew i had it 
 it helped my daughter it shortened it to  days vs  to  we both went to the er with  temps and the doctor explained that tamiflu doesn't change the current symptoms but will shorten the duration and it didnni feel bad for ya uddudcnhope you get well soon
 we have been told to take our temperature before attending clinic keep doing our hand washing avoid air travel at this time and wearing a mask outdoors is not necessary   tamiflu wonut help if you get coronavirus  my life really wonut change that much so i am not worried

 it has a worse death rate than the flu that could change  but it is life threatening to a lot of segments to population flu has a vaccine and tamiflu there is no treatment for this
 in  the who changed their definition of a pandemic to hype hn removing the requirement that the novel rapidlyspreading virus also be very deadly billions were made pushing a vaccine and tamiflu what's holding them back now?n
 dude youure dead wrong worse case scenarios (critical) cause severe pneumonia which in turn requires intubation and ventilation complete pulmonary failure constant treatment of symptoms using drugs like tamiflu and hiv medication like kaletra conditions change within hours
 i can't tell if this man is being serious uddude0nlet's compare the flu which has a mortality rate of 0 predictable pattern of spread wrt seasonal changes amp; can be managed with flu shot amp; tamiflu with a novel coronavirus with mr of  no predictable spread pattern or vaccine 
 even tho chance is low influenza aamp;b are very contagious i personally felt that b is sicker than a in my opinion lol but a is genetically changing and that can cause serious illness in human plus medication like tamiflu (normally prescribed for flu) cause hallucination

 yes but remdesivir is iv and tamiflu is oral; others have tweeted this today but we really need an oral drug if itus going to do what people hope (keep pts out of hospital amp; getting better at home) as a game changer though any progress is great amp;reducing inpt mortality is great
  i consider this as a good news especially in time where we have not seen any good news since the start of the pandemics at this stage though it does not seem to be a game changer it reminds me of tamiflu for influenza or azt approval for hiv
 i was expecting it to be a bit like this statistically effective but probably unimportant interesting perhaps game changer no i suspect the government is all too aware of the tamiflu story
 is this a joke? the placebo and the utreatmentu both round to a fatality rate of  (for extremely ill patients) itus tamiflu that doesnut change the fatality rate
 good news on covid for a change this medication sounds a lot like tamiflu for covid good chance it will reduce the number of deaths and the severity of infectionsn
 this seems another uctamifluud study we get another ucimproves symptomsud when we are looking for something that decreases mortality they changed the endpoints of the study  weeks ago and ucdeathud became ucimproves symptomsud
 fair as well but i think another likely explanation is they adjusted based on the subgroup analysis from the lancet data  neither trial notably changes mortality nnsmells like tamiflu
 no its not we have no toolbox this is tamiflu sold for thousands this is greedy pharma shame they had to keep changing and recruit more people to show tiny anything
 so it looks like remdesivir works for covid in the naid study  thats definitely the best result from any therapeutic trial to date  excellentnnbut its probably broadly similar in efficacy to oseltamivir (tamiflu) in influenza real but not a gamechanger
 tamiflu not pencillin but admined intravenously and with side effects  difference in  studies seems to be severity of cases (which is tied to how early you intervene)  it means our hospital protocols might need to change since right now they are only doing late intervention
 tamiflu isnut really that effective when you look into it not really a game changer
 cool your jets jimthis is as much better as tamiflu has been for flu which is to say not veryneeds early application and doesn't change the odds that greatlythis is not ending stay at home
 remdesivir is a real game changer except it's really not due to the way it'l be administered tamiflu you or me can call our dr and say i think i have the flu i feel this that and the other; plus  i haven't gotten a flu shot  heshe can call it in  this is iv its a mess
 but search remdesivir on google right now check out the news that came out  hr ago they passed the gold standard trials by the nih and niaid its equivalent to the tamiflu when swine flu came out it's a game changer even for people that wanted the lockdown extended yesterday
 lay person here but my understanding is that zinc changes how hcq functions and is needed for the positive outcome? seems so many studies arent combining the two and also administered early is key like other antivirals tamiflu etc
 you are changing the conversation  but it's because we know what the flu is and can mitigate it we have flu vaccines and tamiflunif you want to spinoff conspiracy theories go ahead and tie to to the ufo's
 ain't no game changers or magic bullets out there short of protective vax if developed i'd take a tamiflu if we got it
 mine isn't always so badexcept for the youtube videos according to her the  side effect for tamiflu is death amp; the most dangerous drug on the market is metformin no amount of discussion will change her mind
 baddishnnwe donut know how long it will take to find effective treatments or if they are best administered ve early on like tamiflu (test strategy will have to change)nnso buying time right now seems the sensible and ethical thing to donntime to stockpile better

 itus a completely different virus itus way more deadly we also have a flu vaccine and tamiflu we can exist with the flu we currently cannot coexist with covid in time when a vaccine is created and antiviral treatments are figured out that will change
 do they change the formula for tamiflu every year?
 until there is widespread rapid testing a therapeutic like tamiflu andor a vaccine nothing much can change and people need to realize that
 the man is a damn blessing heus already talking about changing how his practice works in future and getting rid of waiting room all together also has helped parents out in a pinch (ie we got tamiflu rxs when the then mos old got the flu)
 agree in an ambulatory setting could be decreasing severity look how crazy people go for tamiflu to drop a day or so off duration if hdc mitigates viral load and keeps people out of er thatus a potential game changer all that said thatus a more difficult study to do

 i think this is big news for gild and the mkt and perhaps the entire pandemic  if we can start people on remdsevir like a tamiflu or a valtrex to keep the symptoms from getting worst  it will be a game changer
 as a medical interpreter i see people seek medical attention for flu like symptoms gt; hrs after the onset of symptoms since they are outside of the benefit window of tamiflu only offered testing if theyud like to know but it wonut change the treatment supportive care
 democrats listen to greta about climate changescience  of doctors say it helps with the symptoms of covid like tamiflu wrong hasn't been proven
 game changer? weull be lucky to get a tamiflu with some symptomatic relief viral reduction might have some public health value too
 i literally felt i could be dying and was actually ok with it thatus how much it hurt nnin that case tamiflu was a game changer
 so it can be be good for dalla hospitals to have to treat early onset symptoms (kind of like tamiflu maybe) but it wonut save your life if things get severe right now we donut have an antiviral or vaccine that is doing that or we would see the death toll change
 for instance in this case that we are unlikely to have a vaccine for  months at best that means the disease will be as deadly and impossible to control until then but vaccines aren't the only possible counter something like a tamiflu for covid could change the game
 yes i changed my name from tamiflu i canut afford to be a brand name bitch in this economy
 totally amazed that she will not look at facts yes the flu kills however we have a vaccine for it and we also have tamiflu we have nothing for this go ahead and meet up with the college kids and hang out with them
 caveat people aren't testing for the flu as often because it causes a lot of exposure for often no change in management since tamiflu is only indicated for a small subset of a population thus we are diagnosing flu clinically and coding as flulike illness
 i was sick back in febnever had a slight fever and i did thenurgent care put me on augmentinfever happenedwoke up soaked they changed me to zpakand tamifluhelped a little but man was i sick
 don't think he said it was a miracle drug but antivirals like tamiflu aren't a miracle drug against the flu eitherthey help and need to be taken early in the onset of symptoms  game changer for intense cases would be the antibody serums they are testing if they work
 not your doc obviouslynnthe latest is you maintain selfquarantine unless you have actual difficulty breathingnnthe thing is there isn't any medicine you can get that will change your prognosis  you aren't going to go get a dose of tamiflu and feel better  good luck
 for hn we had an antiviral that was in use against the flu and it was called tamiflu they used it and it worked which bought time to get a vaccine we donut have any antivirals or vaccine for this i think that an antiviral of any kind would change this but until then udeuddudcudffcuduufe0f
 tamiflu sounds like what ron swanson calls a hangover after meeting with his ex wife
 the difference between this and the flu is covid is a respiratory illness it attacks the cells in your lungs that are responsible for oxygenco exchange that is why it's so dangerous furthermore we have a vaccine for the flu it's called tamiflu no vaccine for this so far
 better than tamiflu certainly but not by a huge amount no game changer and wouldnut stop a health service having major problems in a surge

 car crashes aren't contagious if they suddenly went from 0 to 000 there certainly would be a lot of demand for changes we have a flu shot and tamiflu for the flu at least we're trying to reduce those deaths
 i donut see any way around that the discussions around r0 donut talk about total infected just the rate of infection from person to person it might change the dynamics of interaction if a treatment similar to tamiflu that reduces duration is found
  replication to minimize the illness in this respect it is a game changern  when given late in a covid illness and to persons with serious comorbidities it is less effective or perhaps not very effective at all tamiflu for the flu has the same effectiveness
