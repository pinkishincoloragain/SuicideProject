 does anybody have any familiarity with wellbutrin and how it impacts anxiety? because i'm at my wit's end with this ocd shit and i'm reading forums and seeing a lot of anecdotes about wellbutrin making ocd worse and there's some clinical evidence to suggest it can
 thank you for sharing this iuve been going through something similar (wellbutrin though) and i canut tell you how much getting help positively impacted me

 i take both zoloft and wellbutrin and i have to say they work beautifully together i feel sooooo much more energized during the day and motivated i definitely have found that adding wellbutrin has made a significant impact on my mental health
 hi worldmentalhealthday i was diagnosed with general anxiety disorder and major depression in my late s i would say iuve been lucky for most of my life they havenut severly impacted me today i take medication (wellbutrin and zoloft) to help there should be no stigma
 and since cbd has its own potential interaction with wellbutrin independent of how it impacts latuda and my other meds secondarily it was kind of a doublewhammy
 i take latuda to address the same cognitive symptoms that reemerged after taking cbd for a couple weeksnnand bc it boosts my antidepressant wellbutrin it made perfect sense that i also became depressed cbd can in theory impact both meds
 i noticed a definite uptick in my ocd symptoms when i started taking cbd turns out both my wellbutrin and latuda are impacted by this same system i'd spoken with my psychiatrist before trying cbd but she didn't know about this particular interaction uddude
 different drugs target different chemicals which might be why one medication worked better than others  i have been on wellbutrin a couple times in my life and it had a positive impact i didnt feel ucbetterud but i could feel the full range of emotions vs low to mid emotions

 but that still doesnut change the impact on physical intimacy so ium going to make an appointment and talk to a doc about adding wellbutrin or some other medication to my regimen and treat this issue ium going to say
 i struggled w fatigue for a large part of  these things had the biggest impact (in reverse order) low dose wellbutrin running multiple times per week(to improve sleep combat depression) same vitamin d dietary improvements (ongoing) cbt amp; other antidepression methods
 i have definitely not found that wellbutrin impacts my ability to cry especially when i forget to take the zoloft chaser
 i have taken them both separately which is why i know that they help with different things wellbutrin made a bigger impact because task avoidance is a big issue for me i donut really notice any side effects but i do get a headache if i miss a dose
 so i had this problem  years ago when i started wellbutrin if ium not careful it creeps up again hereus whatus probably happening in your colon all the things are building up in there amp; impacting when they come out itus like a crowd of people trying to get thru a door
 wellbutrin reduced my appetite when i was on it a few years ago but it affects everyone differently didnut impact my libido at all which was a plus
 no but ium never hungry anyway bc im already on wellbutrin haha so the appetite suppressant is maybe just compacted
 cw medsnnwhich one if i may ask? i had mixed results with wellbutrin and no impact from one whose name i can't recall
 wow i was told wellbutrin acts more on net than on det and that methylphenidate has no impact on net seems my doc was wrong about both
 i did better with cymbalta but there were still side effects  weight gain always sleepy always feeling hot profuse sweating (hey i gave a tmi warning up front)  once again wellbutrin was added and this time it had some positive impact but couldn't solve everything 
 yeah a lot of people don't understand how it impacts motivation intention and executive function i don't even think most people know what executive function is or that the only really effective way to treat it is with cns meds not strattera not wellbutrin
 but wellbutrinus dopamine affinity isnut super strong so it may only be of a small benefit compared to something like adderall which has a more substantial impact on the dopamine system nni found wellbutrinus effectiveness to drop off significantly after a few months on it
 data shows wellbutrin doesnt have any impact on impulse control

 oh i also take wellbutrin it's definitely had a very visible impact on me and i'm incredibly thankful for that stability especially in these past few months
 hrt had no impact on that it was ssris that fucked it up (wellbutrin seems to help?) 
 in fact i'd have to check literature because i'm not  sure but i believe one of the main reasons wellbutrin is commonly prescribed in combination with prozac is because it can lessen the severity of side effects that impact sex drive and sexual performance
 i don't wellbutrin itself is an antidepressant but it has the opposite impact of most  you lose weight and become over energized (some to the point of having heart palpitations) rather than gaining weight and becoming lethargic
 q come off wellbutrin and feels like the brain fog has increased is that normal side effect? no negative impact on mood which is good just some extra head cloudiness feels like that state of mind just after waking up?? sicknotweak
 at that point i switched to wellbutrin and itus mostly been great if youure on antidepressants already i would maybe think about switching to one of the ones that impacts dopamine if youure not already on one it definitely helps a lot with both anxiety amp; adhd nonsense
 yes both vyvanse and wellbutrin are forms of amphetamines i was worried about them and their impact on my anxietyocd (i thought they'd make those skyrocket) but so far so good of course we are allll different and what works for me may not be right for others lt;
 i had that with pretty much any antidepressant that had serotonin effects mine was low but it responded like crazy to any boosts it made my muscles twitch too nnswitched to wellbutrin which doesn't impact serotonin and it's been a lot better

 did you have a bad experience? wellbutrin addresses my severe fatigue and depression and has had a profound impact on my life i am a zombie without it wellbutrin doesn't do much for anxiety in general and can actually worsen it
 i thought i did but it turns out i was just gay and didnut know ium on wellbutrin and ium pretty sure that one is an option for those who donut want their weightsex impacted

 i had a call with my doc this morning and we're adding wellbutrin to my meds to help with depression and hopefully it will also tackle some of the adhd symptoms i struggle with uddudef really really hoping it has a positive impact on the latter

 word recall or speech fluidity?nnany medications that might be having an impact?nn(wellbutrin is a great med but impairs my word recall for instance)
 i tried wellbutrin for an unrelated reason and found its impact weak to nonexistent
 my experience with zoloft is that it didn't impact drive but did impact function and that the function part was mostly mitigated when combined with wellbutrin but obviously everyone's mileage varies drastically on this
 letus normalize it uufe0fnni struggle w depression amp; impulse control the last  years were rough i take wellbutrin amp; struggle bc the mental health system for in ca is terribly impacted so damp;d is my proxy for a therapist ium here for my daughter wife friends everyday 
 i have taken prozac lexapro zoloft pristiq amp; wellbutrin for varying amounts of time and none of them have had any impact on my weight or appetite  i think it really depends on the person but most antidepressants are weight neutral
  poopnnhey mark did they find out what caused it? i had a fecal impaction before from taking wellbutrin some meds can cause you to be unable to go to the point that you need to see a doctor idk if you take that med but it happened to me  times while on it so i had to stop

 tamiflu you forgot to mention the size of its economic impact which grew about  last year what exactly are you complaining about? n
 and in trial  no difference in time (in hours) to symptom alleviation when compared to tamiflu  so main advantage one dose and less side effects would have been more impactful to drop to one dose if included kids xofluza primarycare flu medpeds
 i was just making the point that tamiflu does not cure the flu it's not an antibiotic it just shortens the duration if he was so sick he passed tamiflu wouldn't have had any impact on well being sad situation all together
 actually if you get the flu immediately contact your doctor within  hours of getting sick ask for tamiflu while it doesn't immediately cure you it lessens the impact and most people normally recover within  days
 hi jeff am back in barrow till friday so please message me if you need anything lifts shopping etc tamiflu is designed to reduce complications if you catch the flu amp; will shorten the time you may be ill it wonut prevent catch flu just minimise impact take care
 i got the flu shot two months ago it doesn't prevent flu (clearly) but is supposed to lighten the impact  i got tamiflu i can really only afford a half day off so i am hoping i feel at least  better tomorrow
 how do you know tamiflu wouldn't help you? you for sure know that not all side effects impact all who take ithaving taken tamiflu it does provide  relief of symptoms and reduces time you are sick feel better soon
 how else is gsk gonna get their nut t? nnone frustration for me recently medimpact doesn't cover oseltamivir i have my feelings about tamiflu in general but for a pbm to make that choice for patientsugh 
 well the doc said she didnut see the point in doing the full flu test because all itud do would tell her what she already knows and would have no impact on outcome given itus apparently already on the way out and tamiflu would only shorten it by half a day or so
 lupin sell  levels sl  t nnpost drl expecting weak quarter plus low impact of tamiflu high probability of write off also
 do you think this would have much of an impact on premiums?  less people would get the shot increasing hospital admissions and possibly prescriptions for tamiflu those may offset or possibly overshadow cost savings no?
 next time please don't wait so long there are meds (tamiflu etc) that'll shorten duration amp; weaken impact if taken within hrsnplenty electrolyte fluids rest and please take care of yourself
 didnut know if you saw this yet so iull post the link tamiflu is going otcuddudeuddude  can you imagine the chaos that will come with the logistics of how it will work?? thought it may be interesting to discuss how it will impact us  
 so tell me why neuraminidase inhibition of tamiflu could have negative impact? i assume itus not selective for the virusus enzyme  i figured out why i didnut like it before but forgot my logic
 be careful mike stay on it go to urgent care and get swabbed stat then tamifluuit can lessen the impact if influenza
 it seems the us policy is not containment but to slow an inevitable spread reducing the systemic impact (and possibly buying time for development of a tamiflu equivalent)nam i wrong? 
 get tamiflu it's way better clinically proven to reduce the symptoms and number of days impacted by the flu it is prescription only but easily accessible just ask your doctor a phone call will be sufficient most drs want you to stay away from them
 hn morbidity is independent of secondary infection ) there was no sognif impact of relenza or tamiflu on morbidity
 the covid kills  of old people and it's also more contagious than the flu nalso we have tamiflu which reduces the impact of the flu nyoung people aren't likely to die from the coronavirus but if this becomes widespread (it will) someone you know will probably die
 impact of longterm parental exposure to tamiflu metabolites on the preference for different types of promotional offers
 getting a flu shot wonut always prevent you from getting the flu however it absolutely will reduce its impact if you have been in bed for  days ium hoping you have been tested for flu and received an antiviral med such as tamiflu

 in this instance it's tamiflu which isn't  necessary to take and may not be the most effective medication but assume we've started it and are  days in does  impact the decision how you feel about continuing what you started?
 uctamiflu has little or no impact on complications of flu infection such as pneumoniaud nice
 the flu shot is different from tamiflu it's a medication used to treat the flu not a vaccine as said it's not very effective trails have shown that in has no real impact on recovery the flu shot on the other hand works (to some extent)
 cochrane collaboration finally obtained all the information putting the evidence together it has found that tamiflu has little or no impact on complications of flu infection such as pneumonia

 it does not treat or prevent seizures  putting the evidence together it has found that tamiflu has little or no impact on complications of flu infection such as pneumonia she did take him to hospital but was sent homen
 tamiflu is not a vaccine itus an anti viral  it impacts your body in ways that can be more harmful than the flu itself and itus a calculated risk to take it  there are times when itus warranted but no one should be shamed for not liking the odds
 i've lost trust in drs my pain was well managed for  years i moved and now they won't prescribe however they will prescribe other medications that are negatively impacting my health i have the flu now called them about tamiflu was told it's not that effective
 with more and more people getting flu shots and tamiflu  how come the numbers are largely unchanged?  maybe they have no impact at alluddude
 tamiflu isn't safe and barely works if at all putting the evidence together it has found that tamiflu has little or no impact on complications of flu infection such as pneumonia 
 how long does it take  flu virus to become  billion in your body?  if tamiflu has any impact on this at all you should use it  (the battle is won with speed) if it doesn't i don't see how it could be prescribed by legitimate doctors  sort of a proof by contradiction
  thank sfor keeping how to survive a pandemic as  of your documentaries it was a great refresher on the start amp; deadly impact of the spanish flu we weren't aware the world's supply of tamiflu was so limited more power to the clinicians everywhere protecting us
 stop comparing covid to the flunnwe have flu vaccines and tamiflunnthe flu is not as contagious injurious nor deadly as covidnnnyc's hospitals are being impacted harder than the very worst flu seasons with only 000 covid cases and it is weeks away from peak
 rep bernie sanders  years ago during a hearing talking about tamiflu and the impact on availability were a pandemic to occur bernieforpresident berniebeatstrump nn
 i have heard that some nursing homes have been giving all residents tamiflu prophylactically  could that also be impacting outcomes?
 often forgotten that uk gov identified pandemic flu as the highest impact risk to the country covid isn't flu  and some of the tamiflu stockpiling obvs not relevant but some of the other contingency planning is worth reading  national risk register  
 will be good if itus like flu vaccinevoluntary and recommended for vulnerable and compromised people who spend time in close contact etc also good if there is something like tamiflu to lessen the impact
 this drug slows disrupts the virus ability to replicate in the body similar to what tamiflu does for the regular fluand like tamilu you have to take it earlyit's positive impact on severe cases is limited
 where arethe scientists testing molecular impact?  there seems to be messaging coming out about understanding uthe virusu on a nano level so a pharma solution to fit it can be developed eg tamiflu why not look at cell disruption in electromagnetic frequencies?
 clarke we donut know each other but reread your commentthus far the seasonal flu has killed more people itus killed even though there is a vaccine for it and tamiflu antiviral new coronavirus is a killing machine no vaccine to lessen the impactnresearch ucexponentiallyud
 tamiflu has been shown to cause hallucinations and suicidal behavior in small children with minimal impact to the duration of the illness
 imho early on some people in us were more afraid of flu being dethroned  nnnow itus japaneseus turn to reconsider their societal pressure to tamiflu overprescription in the face of enormous economic impact from covid or more tamiflu? 
 neveri tested positive for hnso did my younger daughter it came on fastwithin hoursfelt like being pummeled by a trash compactor all of a sudden every fiber hurtboth if us got tamiflustarted to feel better in  hours
 that tamiflu prescription was not good we've spoken with a number who say it might have adverse impacts and that there are  drugs for covid instead of tamiflu also almost additional  treatments that will be available long before a vaccine
 so tamiflu type meds have no impact?  i mean the med is not specific to exact flu types?
 possibly but hopefully in the future weull have a vaccine or something similar to tamiflu to greatly reduce the impact
 i donut know ium not medical in anyway from what i have read there have been some success with anti inflammatory drugs for arthritis  not a cure but they hold off impact allowing time for immunity to build up iuve not heard about tamiflu but will look into it
 the flu vaccine still lessens symptoms and tamiflu treats all strands thereus nothing that treats covid like i said it wonut impact us but it will impact the elderly and we need to not be carriers
 because there is mounting evidence that they don't work there is evidence that some might work (remdesivir) but things like tamiflu seem to have no impact
 the main issues are that it's more infectious than flu (meaning it spreads faster) and we don't currently have a vaccine or a specific treatment (like tamiflu for flu) as others said the other problem is overtaxing the health system amp; economic impact by keeping everyone home
 add some numbers on how much is spent yearly on handwashing education making flu vaccine and on treatments like tamiflu to reduce flu's impact to just a few 000s of deaths? then remind them we have only  of those  things to deal with covid so fecking wash your hands
 although to to be accurate tamiflu doesn't make much of a difference to admissions with influenza and only a small difference to duration of symptoms and no proven impact on mortality that i'm aware of nbut influenza not a virus? oh dear
 coronavirus i am concerned these folks may delay care bc ucthey took their tamifluud and that if this is a natl trend we will be impacting tamiflu supplies for when theyure needed on the other hand partner rph posits at least they wonut be coming here to pickup with fever?
 thankfully the odds are in his favor and god bless him i pray for a speedy recovery  now a serious scientific question  what is the precedent (standin for a prior probability) for an antiviral having an impact on outcomes or mortality and don't tell me tamiflu  very low
 there has never been any solid indisputable proof that any of these antiviral drugs have any real impact on viral deaths  the government and the public spent billions on tamiflu for example and there are several studies showing it's of no use
 actually youure wrong it is worse than the flu bc with the flu we not only have flu shots we also have tamiflu which can negate the impact with this virus we currently have no vaccine and it attacks the lungs worse of all we are so behind the ball here
 til that tamiflu has little or no impact on complications of flu infection such as pneumonia 
 remdesivir is probably useless for people on vents if effective at all is likely early in disease biggest impact in ltc facilities like tamiflu u as prophylaxis 
 agree   as you know there are always nuances that impact generalizability of any study findings to me it looks like it may offer similar benefits of tamiflu which makes sense  shorten duration of illness for some likely best if started early time will tell thanks
 remdesivir touted as a standard of care despite a lack of evidence on the impact on survival it is likened to azt for hiv when really it is more like tamiflu 
 tamiflu redux a little something is probably there and we will give it to hospitalized patients but the population level impact is with vaccinationpublic health measures
 remdesivir is the new tamiflu and weull be debating for years whether it makes a meaningful impact  
 it is similar to tamiflu for the flu it inhibits the replication of the virus so if it is given early it should have an impact in reducing the length and severity of the infection  not nothing but also not a cure
 pic shows tamiflu knocking down viral load by  orders of magnitude vs placebo by day two if an antiviral did that in covid i'd be optimistic about the mortality benefit unfortunately that chinese data showed no impact on viral load prolly gotta treat impractically early
 i assume tamiflu impacts viral load in the settings in which it slightly speeds recovery time?
 the world impact of hn upwards of 000 deaths most under  years of age in the first year alone even with vaccines and tamiflu 
 a couple of pharmacists and docs i follow say that the  regular flu strains are almost nonexistent  some think social distancing has had a huge impact no tamiflu being prescribed no wh flu doesn't override reg flu is the real deal
 all were peer reviewed during sars amp; found to have better antiviral impacts than big pharmaceutical drugs like tamiflu etc just search those worlds in amazon or ebay and it will list  plant based supplements that incorporate them 
 scientists cautious on tamiflu's impact on bird flu  npr 
 scientists cautious on tamiflu's impact on bird flu 
 which cohorts it impacts how contagious it is  we know that for covid now good enoughnnhow to treat it have therapeutics  they'll be not dissimilar to ones for flu so get going on itnntamiflu?  yeah  tamiflu  
 but again ivor we know all about the flu specifically which cohorts it impacts how contagious it is how to treat it have therapeutics (eg tamiflu) and have vaccinesnnwith covid we don't have any of that simply  months of preliminary data on who maymay not be at risk
 i read an article that said french public felt govt had overreacted to swine flu with ppe amp; tamiflu bought but unusedlots of outrage about wastage huge public inquiry amp;their health minister ridiculed for years about her 'overreaction' impact on current state of affairs there
 do senior living facilities in oregon give flushots to all residents as a matter of protocol? i know some also gave tamiflu prophylactically could these things be impacting outcomes? n
 yes it was agreed the name encompassed the opinions and projections of 'experts in their fields' which put together predicted chaos after brexitn'experts' predicted the amount of tamiflu we needed years agoni did'nt see risk eveluation where impact x probability  action plan
 if there is treatment for it testing of asymptomatic people would be totally unnecessary we donut test everyone in the country when flu season starts those who are impacted are treated with tamiflu or other remedies
 long term care facilities give flu shots as a matter of course and have also been giving tamiflu prophylactically nthere is reason these things may be impacting covid_ outcomes can we look at this?n
 serious question since ium all for leaving it up to physicians to prescribe offlabel as they see fit is there a real risk of a shortage (like with tamiflu in ) if we donut have restrictions? esp because this could impact people with existing autoimmune conditions too
 yes i know flu is bad i tested negative for flu i was given tamiflu it had no impact
 i guess is thinking in terms of absence of antivirals etc as will be the case in mayjune  but even with antivirals would public health measures still take precedence? tamiflu had little impact on spread of  flu  not just because it was only weakly effective
 there's some legitimate (but small) studies that indicate hydroxychloroquine could have an impact but only as a shortening effect if taken early (similar to tamiflu) possibly useful as a future treatment in mild cases but it won't stop the pandemic
 yes  and the rate of transmission is a reflection of lack of immunity lack of vaccine in population in flu even suboptimal vaccination rates disrupt many chains of infection much better studied virus  therefore other agents eg tamiflu also available to lessen flu impact
 weeks ago that there is some evidence that tamiflu can help treat covid so i donut know if the fact that my mother took it had any impact or if we were careful enough itus hard to sayamp; a big mystery i think weull learn a lot in the months ahead thx for your kind messageuufe0f
 will remdesivir be to covid what osetamivir (tamiflu) is to influenza? something that only impacts the duration?
 perhaps but the studies so far indicate hcq used early has a significant  impact for years we have noticed azith made a noticeable impact on influenza cases but we still use the tamiflu early as well
 the other issue with viral directed therapies is route of administration the holy grail for maximal population impact is oral route (think tamiflu for sarscov) of course this is impossible with antibody approaches and remdesivir also is iv
 interesting seems to reinforce that early may help but that there's a threshold where it doesn't (similar to tamiflu)nnneed a trial with time or severity markers to clarify potential for impact binary yesno cohorts seem to just add to confusion or prophylactic trial with hcw
 the only factor that can have a meaningful impact is a lowcost outpatient therapeutic equivalent to tamiflunnthe only one is zinc with an ionophore like hcq there is only one lonely trial at st francis in ny its completion date is too late amp; its hcq dose may be too small
 thus itus critical to develop several treatments (ie tamiflu equivalents) amp; pray our bodies develop strong immunity through inevitable exposure but hopefully small viral loads as quantity impacts gravity of illness thus masks amp; distancing will remain important unfortunately
 not statistically significant but certainly a signal need confirmation will it be like tamiflu? shortens time to improvement but no impact on mortality?
 not an attorney but emergency approval should expired once emergency is over in the absence of new data tamiflu illustrated a major system problem fda almost never withdraw a full approval unless due to side effects  gt;  m prescriptions per year  very little impact on m amp; m

 this does not mean we shouldn't take strict actions to help out while the medical profession does its thing today if you have the flu they give you tamiflu (sp?) which really helps diminish the impact from it  we need one of these for covid as well as a vaccine to help here
 itus not a cure corona viruses by nature have no ucureu  but like tamiflu itus a treatment to lessen the viral impact and potentially save lives
 scientists often get important things wrong eg initial denial of cfc's impact on the ozone layer; climate change;  neonicotinoids impact on pollinators; thalidomide tamiflu water on mars asian countries wear masks for a reason
 actually it's shown to reduce hospitalization time by almost onethird that's huge that's like the impact of tamiflu on swine flu
 tbh i got pulled into the gp because i thought he was exaggerating () but i then had to take tamiflu for  weeks  so it had an impact on us all
 okay so you're talking limited trials offuse? yeah effectiveness is kinda important try tamiflu on it? it's safe but pointless to try ni can see trying something that might be effective so long as is doesn't impact supply for those who do need it
 since all the treatment for the most part is supportive not an issuen the data on tamiflu is suspect at best  ribavarin?? no real impact on outcome
 as with remdesivir tamiflu at best reduced the duration of illness without impacting mortality as with remdesivir tamiflu was very expensive and was stockpiled by the governmentud 
 i bet you donut have a degree in anythingseeing how you donut have the capacity for logicnn000 flu hospitalization for half the yeartamiflu and vaccinations are really making an impact dumbass
 hard pass full year on one side my yo excels wremote learning online socialization etc on the other side we still donut understand the lt impact of covid on the body amp; have no symptom reduction meds (like tamiflu for flu) itus just not worth it for our family
 efficacy of this agent for significant impact upon influenza treatment has been in doubt for over a decade tamiflu fraud bilked  billion from government alleges whistleblower 
 i got the swine flu you know how it impacted my life? i was sick for a week was able to get tested for it and pick up tamiflu for my pharmacist it was completely normal
 very similar profiles actually antivirals that must be given early in course of infection tamiflu at least is oral administration remdesivir is ivnboth mostly seem to shorten course of illness little impact on mortality  but perhaps because seldom administered early enough
 you should atleat take a tamiflu shot for pneumonia  it does lessen the impact on the lungs 
 i'm not sure a vaccine might not work for everyone we may have to find ways to lessen the illness's physical impact like how tamiflu does or other medicines we'll adjust to some things but work to vaccinate people 
 and like the last study they are being tested on severe cases tamiflu may not have worked on severe flu cases either but if you catch your flu within  days you can limit the impact of the virus i know med is hard to follow but please try
 the gist seems to be remdesivir is tamiflu for covid shortens duration of illness does not impact severity (ofc severity doesn't inherently correlate with postviral disability permanent or not) 
 i had the swine flu and it impacted me less than covid which i havenut had it was not a big deal and there was plenty of tamiflu available to treat it uddude
 covid has killed more people since march than the flu has in  years despite more flu infections by many order of magnitude there are also many effective treatments for the flu such as vaccines and tamiflu flu also doesnut have the long term impact of covid

 i truly believe remdesivir should be treated like tamiflu the earlier the better and before hypoxia  i think it has zero impact on outcomes mortality or morbidity after hi flow  ards stages etc
