 hey minimize the singing pal i'm trying to get some sleep here? uddude0uddude0uddude0uddude0
 fuck that sleeping is the worst
 this works wonders for me when ium having a hard time getting to sleep
 i'm totally the same way  i rather be cozy sleeping or just whenever in my home definitely in the high 's
 but yeah i'm on lamictal cymbalta abilify and wellbutrin now  trazodone nightly to sleep and xanax as needed two types
 yeah i notice no discernible effect from it i definitely notice the wellbutrin because i go from being able to function (even with a little anxiety) to sleeping all but  hours out of the day (saturday)
 ime wellbutrin has been effective for reducing fatigueregulating sleep wouldn't say its made me less depressed but def more functional
 guess weure trying wellbutrin now a friend of mine said it hyped him up so much that he literally barked at his coworkers so crossing fingers for something like that better than wanting to sleep  hours a day
 lol i took a wellbutrin to go to sleep but the shit ainut work
 was put on wellbutrin today to help with depression hoping it works and i don't want to sleep all day and then binge eat ate a shrimp salad for lunch off to go paint some boards to fix my garage then take a nap 
 wellbutrin almost led me to my death lmfao that was such a time i was existing in a state of perpetual tachycardia didn't shower didn't eat didn't sleep skinny jeans fit me like slacks just walking made me feel like i had emphysema fuck that shit
 wellbutrin xl is a  hour time release so you only have to take it once a day  i am terrible at remembering any meds that are not taken at night (with the one i need to sleep) so that switch helped me a lot the tablets aren't as pretty though plain white
 ironically i was considering whether the wellbutrin was worth it because of the tinnitus that i know from an experience w ambien will eventually make sleep physically impossible
 uor combination of meds i started with prozac went to prozacwellbutrin and now am just on wellbutrin (and lowdose remeron to sleep)
 good to know thank you one of these will probably be necessary i'm also on amitriptyline (which is also an ad) for sleep which has been working really well in combo with the wellbutrin the dst shift three me off balance on the sleep front though
 wellbutrin reportnnmy productivity has vastly improved making art doesn't hurtnfeeling more like myselfnsuperinsomina i like itni can sleep on my back without nightmaresnlowered appetite it is what it isn(tmi moment) my libido is back to normalnnthis is a good
 ium convinced something is wrong with me how is it that wellbutrin doesnut stop me from sleeping
 it's doing the opposite for me wellbutrin was helping me dig my way out of winter gloom this time shift is just effing up my sleep patterns again
 i had to change psychiatrists because i was getting the same treatment i will never forget telling her wellbutrin was messing with me and her answer was sleeping meds
 wellbutrin so farnninsomniansome vertigondry mouth when i sleepnslowed appititenni think the emotional weight is less? we'll see how this goes
 i was like why can't i sleep then i remembered im on fucking wellbutrin now and that shit causes insomnia
 been on wellbutrin for a week and i was able to sleep last night for the first time in months and my anxiety is getting a lil better and apparently thatus an early sign that the med is starting to work which makes me v happy
 so low doses of vyvanse and dextroamphetamine make anyone else really sleepy? i havenut been able to leave my bed a day and i just woke up from another napnis this from the medication? am i still adjusting to no wellbutrin?? idk what to do anymore omg
 i often have trouble sleeping (even wbenedryl) i think it's partly related to my mental health issues when i was prescribed wellbutrin as a kid () stay up for sometimes nights started hiding pills around my room instead of taking em found orange pills in room for years
 i fought it on my own my whole life then finally got meds cause my wife basically gave me an ultimatum celexa and wellbutrin are what i take to keep my brain balanced then itus sleep exercise and a little weed uddude0
 i had to stay on zoloft when i started wellbutrin bc it ramped my anxiety up also i take w in the morning amp; z at night bc of the effects they each have on my sleepiness
 acid reflux? i already have acid reflux lexapro gave me compulsive yawning but it tapered off after a while abilify made me very very very sleepy wellbutrin was fine it just stopped working
 contrave and sleepiness 
 that's a classic adhd thing (that i've avoided really following up on for myself facepalm) but i've known coffee can make me sleepy for years and when i started wellbutrin which was supposed to be enervating i collapsed into the couch and slothed and giggled
 my wellbutrin dose has gone up to  since then and i'm on ambien for sleep
 oh wellbutrin update it has made me very itchy so right now ium on nothing again and so thatus why ium so sleepy seeing doctor on wednesday gonna show him my itches
 going from the wellbutrinfueled accelerated depression back to my normal level of depression feels like the mental health equivalent to sleeping in your bed for the first time after having been sleeping in your car for the past two weeks
 thank you for all you do god bless all law enforcement women and men much love and be safe stated i had a bag full of medicines i never took delivered sleeping pills abilify cymbalta metformin wellbutrin and who knows what else doctors are worded robots listen drs gq
 noooo thank god i tried that a few years ago and thought i was going insane ium doing wellbutrin right now and i got like no sleep rip
 this tweet refers to the fact that zoloft makes me sleepy and wellbutrin gives me energy
 i didnut experience itching but idk maybe wellbutrin just didnut work for me considering itus supposed to make you energized and i literally was skipping school every day to come home and sleep bc i was exhausted so maybeeee keep an eye out for that one??
 me after  mg ritalin and  mg wellbutrin sleepnme that time i accidentally took twice the dose 
 i think the wellbutrin is working cos ium not so sleepy but it also might be cos i slept all day on tuesday but anyway ium pretty happy ium not on my old meds which made me sleep longer
 and basically he said ucwtf are you doingud so ium on not wellbutrin now and alao got a food tracker app and man i finally grapsed the problem when i discovered i was ready to go to bed after  calories what the hell anyway im sleepy and made some of my food goals today
 my dad takes a low dose of wellbutrin to help him sleep
 oh that's nice th day in a row that i've taken wellbutrin and fallen into a dead sleep  minutes later for  hours isn't this supposed to wake people up???
 yeah i'm pretty sure this wellbutrin is doing the opposite of what it normally does for people?nnit's supposed to be a stimulant and give energy but i was feeling reasonably awake before i took it today and now i'm fighting myself not to sleepnngonna try it at night tomorrow
 i take wellbutrinbupropion in the morning and a combo of sertralinezoloft and trazodone (this one is mostly to help me sleep but is also an antidepressant) at night i've tweaked the dosages twice over the past two and a half years or so but i'm pretty happy with the mix
 ok depression i know you're here becausei've cut back on my wellbutrin you're small now but i can feel you trying to grow like a fucking cancer but i got shit to do today so please save the existential dread for tonight when i can't sleep mmmk?
 wellbutrin makes my migraines worse including my migraine aura without infarction (ie the walls move all the time) it makes me anxious and i have trouble sleeping that i didn't used to have it is worth it but lots of people don't know to expect side effects
 damn madison i need to see if my doctor will prescribe me soma i've tried ambien lunesta and wellbutrin with weird side effects still unable to sleepuddude
 story of my life nzoloft prozac and cymbalta all made me sleepy wellbutrin helps with my depression but makes my anxiety worse abilify made me sleepy buspar had no side effects but unfortunately no beneficial effects either gabapentin is maybe helping with anxiety?
 dude the sleeping pills my doc gave me for insomnia fucking kicked my ass so bad the first night i slept like hrs my wellbutrin also mad me sleepy at first but i'm over that now
 i have a hard time falling asleep bc racing thoughts amp;also a really hard time motivating to get up tried tazodone amp; benadryl ium also on lexapro for anxiety added wellbutrin which is taken twice a day and nowhere near bedtime worked wonders for me

 time for a miserable sleep from which i'll be going the weekend unmedicated (i might open an old emergency bottle of wellbutrin tho)
 wellbutrin works well but it ramps up anxiety for about  months before it starts working i still take  mg of ativan to sleep though
 day  i'm not expecting much from the first day of use i think any changes i'm seeing are from me not being on stimulants like prozac or wellbutrin anymore i am v sleepy but my anxiety seems chilled
 ask your physician about wellbutrin (generic bupropion) that doesnut interfere with sleep to quitsmoking like the wellbutrin sr which lasts during the daytime and wears off by the evening mentalhealthawareness cigarettes tobaccobreakshearts healthtips healthtalk 
 tried wellbutrin on a friendus advice and it fucked me up in all the wrong ways (reduced sleep  dry mouth  hello surprise sick) nnglad itus helping you though
 day two of new dosage of wellbutrin hoping to get some sleep soon
 im having a fucking episode crying over something stupid and im wondering if itd be okay to take my wellbutrin already i think about hrs have passed since i took my meds but its am amp; im about to go to sleep anyways
 i went off wellbutrin cold turkey and it was no fun i got these feelings some people call brain shivers where it's like an electric current running through your head it took two years for all the side effects to go away (lots of sleeping dampened feelings)
 ium the opposite when i went through my tenure mess all i wanted to do was sleep i needed something to pick me up thanks wellbutrin and prozac
 ever since starting a new medication and restarting my wellbutrin i feel so much better and more social and i have a sleep schedule and i wake up at my usual time wow quality uddudccudcudffe
 changes in dosages can correlate with different aspects (not only tolerance)  being busierdistractederfor me more stressed because stress distracts me other med you may add or subtract (eg i can take less adderallxr wwellbutrin xl) and lifestyle changes (eg sleep)
 i have been on either prozac lamotrigine wellbutrin or just two or all three of them since  i got sick of it all amp; stopped meds in january not a smart move my anxiety went totally out of control nnanyway adjusting meds sucks and hello from a fellow chronicsleeper
 oh damnmaybe when u lessen the wellbutrin u can have less sleep meds at least? have you ever tried an ssri with lamictal?
 i've had trouble staying awakeat all the amount i have to sleep now is almost doubled whichi mean i was already sleeping a lot so i'm not a fan i can probably push to get back on the wellbutrin tbh because this is fvcking ridiculous my anxiety is maybe marginally better
 after  amp; u trying all the things that usually work when ium feeling down i gave up amp; went on wellbutrin in january i still get upset worried angry but have more distance donut internalize it  amp; sleep   hrs instead of 
 i lost weight on wellbutrin bc it kills yr appetite and makes you want to run around the city a million times but then i crash midday and sleep for  hours body looking good but also it kills my sex drive so who cares? sighhhh
 (yeah i know hydroxyzine is an antihistamine but it does help with anxiety and sleeplessness i was also prescribed wellbutrin for my depression and to help me focus)
 i take wellbutrin in the morning with a multivitamin and vitamin d at night seroquel and amitriptyline for sleep aid works for me cognitive behavioural therapy as well as acceptance and commitment therapy were huge too
 it just goes to show that drug effectiveness is dependent on an individual's biology and specific symptoms more than anything  wellbutrin is more effective in cases of depression that involve excessive sleepiness and lack of motivation stuff like that
 sleep does not seem to want to be happening i promise i didnut take a wellbutrin for nostalgiaus sake
 realized yesterday that i had been forgetting my wellbutrin for a week today all the stress is getting to me making me cry sleep and want to burn it all down brainweasels allofit

 if i don't take lexapro for a couple of days it feels like i am walking on ice i also found it is the one that agrees with me the most i had a doctor that tried putting me on wellbutrin the nightmares were horrible felt like i was yelling for  hours in my sleep
 i woke up about  hours ago and have a new prescription of wellbutrin that i got last night cause i have low energy and sleep too much most of the time uddude0

 my mom ended up taking me to the hospital but she wouldn't leave my side when they were asking me questions so i lied as to not worry her they told me i wasn't in enough danger to be hospitalized so they sent me home with sleeping pills and wellbutrin uddude

 prozac or wellbutrin? if you are going to ask for medicine you better know the difference because most doctors do not wellbutrin is for those who eat and sleep away the day if you are overly anxious wellbutrin can be dangerous but prozac might give a sense of calmnessle

 yay us thanks ium on wellbutrin and nonscript same (which interestingly is an rx in europe for depression) the psychiatrist also prescribed gabapentin for these early couple of weeks so i could finally get real restorative sleep and fish oil which i already took
 if the one youure on esp if itus wellbutrin tell your doc you need something differentnpractice self care you know eat sleep hydrate go for walks find someone  even a dog  to hugn

 my cat sleeps on  next to me at night here's her right now 
 it went away after a while i feel like the wellbutrin has been working but i take it later in the day now so i donut get edgy in the morning but the result is ium asleep when itus stronger maybe
 yeah with wellbutrin you're supposed to take the xl tablets as far away from sleep as you possibly can i'm not sure why they suddenly have started throwing in weird side effects for me but it's really not fun
 yeah lol lexapro helped me sleep but that was about it ium on wellbutrin now which is nice but it being an appetite suppressant doesnut help and my anxiety acts up on occasion
 my exwife took it for her bipolar disorder and shetoo had similar angersleep issues as well as a lack of sex drive we wound up switching to wellbutrin and found it much better might want to ask your doctor about it
 apparently if you have medicaid and your doctor prescribes wellbutrin to help you stop smoking and possibly get some sleep you have to jump through hoops held by people who could care less in order to get it it 
 yeah ium still on it i take it in conjunction with wellbutrin and itus helped a lot that celexa wouldnut let me sleep i would fall asleep fast but stayed waking up so i woke up uneven as hell
 the trialanderror part is so trying paxil made me suicidal prozac made me hate sex wellbutrin did exactly nothing zoloft seems to do the trick partly but only with lamictal trazodone was nice when i was having trouble sleeping amp; atarax is helpful for both that and hives
 did lexapro make u gain? any bad side effects? how diff is it from wellbutrin u i didnt expirence any bad side effects or gain weight but lexapro makes me sleepy and wellbutrin 
 interviewer so to what do you owe your success?nnme a diet of accutane and wellbutrin also i meditate several hours a night every two or three days but i just call it sleeping it's really a sleeping meditation so now i'm skinny and my face is clear

 my lamictal got upped as well and wellbutrin got added to my host of pills to take so y'all i am feelin good and sleepin like goddamn rock
 so i miscounted ium actually on my th antidepressant now not including what i take for sleep and migraines that are actually low dose antidepressantsnnprozac latuda effexor wellbutrin cymbalta lamicital and now zoloft uddude
 i just made months on wellbutrin and itus really helped me my only issue is i have trouble getting proper sleep at night despite taking it early in the morning at  months i had a lot of mood swings tho and by now itus seriously evened out and itus really great
 i was once prescribed wellbutrin to help w mild depression i began hallucinating stopped sleeping and endured a psychotic break that landed me in a hospital thx doc ur the best prescribedharm
 boss you seemed really tired yesterday was there any reason for that besides lack of sleep?nme (distinctly remembering that i accidentially took a trazadone at am instead of my wellbutrin) no no reason at all probably just bad sleep scheduling on my part won't happen again
 guys i can't find my wellbutrin and i'm feeling too depressed to look for it should i take a ritalin to boost my motivation to look even if it means i might not be able to sleep?
 i seem to remember a nasty experience with wellbutrin marketed as zyban in the snni didn't sleep for a week
 wellbutrin worked well for a long time i actually lost weight but i did have the strange side effect of auditory hallucinations like uchearingud doorbells ring sometimes in the middle of sleep and iud wake up and have to see if the dog heard it too uddude0

 i had that before itus not too shabby ium so glad youure off wellbutrin andddd i definitely canut sleep without pot it bothers me when docs save give it up but you wanna give me a sleeping med that iull legit become dependent on? thatus a no from me fam pot is safer
 always worth a shot and ya there are many different types of meds depending on your mental health unluckily my side effects is staying up too long and lack of sleep so in going to test others i took cipralex and taking wellbutrin now just so you know
 my doc says that antidepressants can sometimes cause mania and that the side effects are not worth it i also take wellbutrin (my last doc said it might increase my sex drive nah) and trazodone (helps me sleep after i went off seroquel) hopefully i can get down to just lithium
 omg i took wellbutrin and it was awful i couldn't sleep i got suicide thoughts it was terrible there is better medication than that
 thanks right now i want sleep the most seems like being on wellbutrin (bupropion) works against the worst withdrawal symptoms same as zyban uddude

 sure sex is cool but have you tried wellbutrin and  hours of sleep?
 this psychiatrist is cheering you on wellbutrin will help you do all the things you can do that will help sleep exercise diet you should be proud of yourself
 wellbutrin is like that isnut it?? always feels like you could do it yourself if you could just figure out your sleep schedule or your vitamins or your diet or your exercise or whatever
 yeah i've been on ritalin but i think i need a lower dose bc i'm rly sensitive to it? my problem is i sleep far too much but if i take a stimulant then i don't sleep at all amp; get awful mood swings and with wellbutrin i just get upset and then go to sleep and wake up more upset
 we added wellbutrin to keep me awake and melatonin to put me to sleep better living through chemicals? fixed my brain now itud be cool if we could fix my back
 just had my meds adjusted last visit i have been on wellbutrin for my depression they upped my depakote to  mg this seems to have helped some i still want to sleep  hours a day no matter what we still have a way to go still on the benzos
 anxiety update wellbutrin is surprisingly helpful and also helps with my add it's been a very productive week and given the work is being dumber than normal that's saying a lot main side effect totally messing up my sleep cycle
 patients should take wellbutrin first thing in the morning so they avoid sleep difficulties at night had someone once taking it midday and they had terrible insomnia youdontknowunlessyouask
 yes it does for sure i can fall asleep normally now thankfully best of luck with wellbutrin i hope it works really well for you
 i went back on wellbutrin for the first  months after his election since then my reflux has come back and i sleep for shit anymore

 also been sleeping better on the new dose of wellbutrin and i can read better but the emotional rollercoaster is
 i'm currently on seroquel and wellbutrin been on them for about  months nowseroquel has messed up my sleeping habits i can't sleep without taking it (i literally don't sleep) but it really works i don't mind the sleeping disorder 
 tonight iuve had to take many sleep aids to combat insomnia i think ium not used to the wellbutrin yet uddude
 this is what happens when you mix your adderall and your wellbutrin insomnia get some sleep my man ium sure mueller is sleeping like a baby
 ium on wellbutrin right now (rather the generic buproprion) it works well if you take it right but it can have its side effects i took mine too late in the day a couple times and couldnut sleep at all in those situations my body was exhausted but my brain was still wired
 i'm still very depressed i have not improved at all with the addition of wellbutrin all i have to look forward to is my psych appointment but now i'm just feeling so over it i don't know when i'm gonna ever be a healthy me again sleep is the only reprieve
 i took concerta for add as a kid and hated it but now i'm on lexapro and wellbutrin for anxiety and depression and it's definitely better my main complaint is that i am hopelessly sleepy like  lol
 on my journey i tried lexapro made me crazy effexor worked really well but it made my palms and feet clammy  and couldnut orgasm so bye lol wellbutrin worked pretty well idk why i stopped taking it and now ium back on zoloft itus okay but i canut sleep well on it
 wellbutrin's sleep related side effects are gone so i'm a monophasal sleeper againnnoh well
 wellbutrin has fucked up my sleep schedule so bad ugh

 hey i forgot my bupropion (wellbutrin) dose today and i don't want to take it now bc it'll interfere with sleep should i expect withdrawal? i'm on the extended release
 damn wellbutrin has worked so well for me i didnut realize people had such bad experiences with it iuve been taking it for a little under a year only side effects iuve had were slight anger and restlessness for the first week everything else just muted me or put me to sleep
 lexapro i think is the stuff they tried to have me on last they wonut give me wellbutrin because itull make me manic and also because it gives me high blood pressure i wonut take antipsychotics or effexor and abilify amp; everything else just makes me sleepy and useless
 wellbutrin made my lips and eyes swell i lost lbs i looked like a sleepy kardashian took it to treat mdd anxiety was a side effect here we are a year after i stopping taking it still anxious thanks for the new diagnosis wellbutrin
 zoloft is kinda shitty bc i can't cry when i need to and i spend the first half of every day either halfasleep or nearcomatose wellbutrin doesn't let you feel feelings either but at least i could be miserable and functional psychdrugs review
 canut sleep and can entirely tell this is wellbutrin induced minor mania so ium gonna go to spin at  am
 okay so when i try to fall asleep close to when i take my wellbutrin it likes to implant creepy things to terrify me and it decided sin from ffx with peter griffinus head on it was the worst it could do cause now itus late and ium laughing at this stupid thought
 anyway today im thankful for wellbutrin and also my sleeping meds
 psychiatry is like baby ur on zoloft for obsessive thoughts but that causes sexual dysfunction so we put u on wellbutrin but that causes anxiety so we put u on  klonopin but that causes fuzzy brain so we put u on ritalin but that causes sleep probs so we  put u on trazadone udcudfudcudf
 wellbutrin is dope side effects are weight loss increased libido sleep regulation and it also works for smoking cessation (or just impulse control in general) if thatus something you could use ium a big fan
 just watching your new video girl i switched from effexor (makes you sleep constantly) to wellbutrin (causes insomnia) it was a fucking struggle then i had to switch again really hope it works well for you though babe uddudceuddudce
 trouble sleeping is a side effect of wellbutrin but like i've been on the meds for like almost  weeks now so you'd think that i wouldn't be suffering from side effects now
 i don't know if this is all a side effect of the wellbutrin but as i fall asleep i feel my bed rumble or shake and i hear muffled voices like a distant tv that was left on through the white noise my fan makes it hasn't been a problem tho but it's quite interesting
 who else out there is sleepy because you forgot to take your second dose of wellbutrin airhorn airhorn airhorn)
 i helped a friend this past weekend with her son who had gotten out of treatment (long story) and to my surprise he was out due to insurance cutoff the mental health pro had him on  anticonvulsive medswellbutrinsleep aids he arrived at my house on day  of cold turkey
 wellbutrin respiradone zyprexa effexor lamictal currently on cymbalta and then trazadone at night to sleep best combo i have been on i also have fibromyalgia and chronic migraines cymbalta helps make the pain bearable sleeping w fms but no trazadone is pointless
 also you know how they say antidepressants can take  months before you start seeing a difference?nnnot wellbutrin at least for me within  minutes i get a wave of energy that only makes me jittery if i'm actively trying to sleep
 easily treatable symptom but every doctor i had ignored the complaint until my most recent one put me on wellbutrin and it was lifechanging  hours of sleep and still exhausted vs  and normally fine all day
 did wellbutrin ever work for u? u i dont fall asleep all day anymore but ium still sad af amp; canut focus 
 effexor and wellbutrin (and ambien to sleep) and xanax as needed it's still not enough not for this election
 quick update on the mental health situation iuve been detailing over the last few days the doctor is now having me add trazadone at night to help with sleep and anxiety now taking that in conjunction with wellbutrin next step more freakinu exercise mustwalkmore

 i'm on a combo of wellbutrin in the morningmirtazipine at night to help me sleep right now i was taking venlafaxine which seems like a weaker pristiq in the quick googling i did
 angry trex noises i need to take more wellbutrin andor go the fuck to sleep i apologize for the salt mine wall collapsing i hoard annoyance trying not to be bothered until i combust it's a work in progress x _ x
 zoloft is weird either works like magic or not at all took me  months on it to fully settle definitely lots of people get an energy boost from it and canut sleep if they take it at night wellbutrin is like that too i hope it works for you nnalso on sleeping 
 becoming a big fan of wellbutrin (low side effects) the biggest improvement i found was an alprazolam that made me sleep at night regular sleep helps suicide really does destroy the lives of loved ones itus not doing them a favor
 i couldnut sleep my outfit is fugazy my shoes donut go and i forgot to take my wellbutrin this is going to be a day
 lol i'm still thinkin about this escitalopram makes me sleepy and gain weight and not want to be touched and wellbutrin gives me energy makes me lose weight and allows my personality to exist but also brings back some of my anxiety
 i went through something similar when i started working amp; my fiancu00e had one last year of school so we only saw each other twice a month iud been stable on wellbutrin  lamictal for years but suddenly needed xanax and depakote to sleep when she graduated it got easier
 yes every morning i used to take strattera amp; wellbutrin i had to stop strattera as the first time around it was a miracle drug being off of it for a year and going back put me in the ernnevery night i take zoloft and ambien so my brain stops buzzing enough to actually sleep
 when i started wellbutrin i couldnut like eat or sleep for the first  weeks i had to go on an anxiety med to bring me down a little bit because i was going insane
 insomnia while on wellbutrin  insomnia cantsleep
 get that wellbutrin best of both worlds uddude0euddude0e but also likefuck sleep

 these wellbutrin dreams are getting too wild and too vivid like ium waking up upset because of fights i had in my sleep
 wellbutrin fucked me up i felt cracked out didn't sleep for a few weeks and cried the whole time i wish you luck
 you're doing the work of angels making it so i am too full and sated and sleepy to follow through with my plans of stepping in front of trax any chance we can get some wellbutrin infused cheese curds in future?
 wellbutrin is the fucking worst i told my doc i donut do well on stimulants and he was like ucitus not a stimulantud itisafuckingstimulant i couldnut sleep it was like tobacco on crack rage for miles in all directions misery
 so i take wellbutrin to help me with the smoking down to a pack every three days taking both paxil and wellbutrin exasperates the restless leg syndrome i've had most of my life also have trouble sleeping because of the wellbutrin so i take trazadone
 i take anxiety meds wellbutrin to focus and melatonincbd gummies to sleep
 i know ima sounds like a broken record but it took me like  tried to find the ones for me i have too many side effects from them so the only ones with side effects that i could manage is wellbutrin idk where i would be without it i used to sleep my life away 
 does anybody who takes wellbutrin have times where you just can never sleep because of it?
 me started on sertraline for anxiety with trazedone for my sleeping problems (regular nightly panic attacks) added in wellbutrin after about six weeks sertraline really toned down the anxiety noise wellbutrin deals with the apathy and exhaustion of depression
 odd when i started ssris all i did was sleep it was starting wellbutrin that killed my sleep for months before my body got used to it i kept taking it though it really helped
 i thumbnailed a comic that i'd really like to draw because i put one of my rem rebound dreams in it this dream is back from when i was starting on wellbutrin and skipping nights of sleep
 i was so sleepy on zoloft that i fought it most of the day wellbutrin doesn't make me sleepy
 not to get all medical professional on you but naloxone isnut a fix all drug for any kind of od it only works on opiatesnot ibuprofen not wellbutrin not sleeping pills that is all
 high dose of wellbutrin and xanax as needed i only take it on a weekend so i can sleep as much as i can do not drink and take it you might have a blackout
 i switched to paxil briefly once due to interaction concerns and it didn't really do anything for me i added wellbutrin for a while in my s and it mostly made me more anxious and disrupted my sleep so
 i'm so fucking tired wellbutrin stole all my sleep
 i actually dont feel too bad considering double wellbutrin dose i'm just really activated i think i'll still sleep though
 effexor wellbutrin and abilify for depression topamax for ptsd and trazadone for sleep plus an extra boost for my depression it's a miracle i've never had serotonin syndrome
 effexor er mg wellbutrin er mg ambien mg for sleep which i have had gnarly reactions to other sleepaids nthey ain't happy pills but they sure make the mood less sticky in the muck at the bottom
 i'm on sertraline amp; wellbutrin nlike you sleeping  hours on weekdays more on weekends couldn't manage laundry cook or clean let alone meet up with ppl i couldn't even watch new shows or movies because i couldn't handle emotional involvement with fictional characters

 these days just prozac but iuve been on lexapro and wellbutrin and trazedone for sleep way back in the day 
 currently mg venlafaxine (effexor) and mg bupropion (wellbutrin) daily and clonazepam (klonopin) most nights before bed recently my doc prescribed trazodone for when i still can't fall asleep but i don't like the side effects so i take it v rarely 
 mg effexor for anxiety mg wellbutrin for depression armodafinil for excessive daytime sleepiness likely caused by the effexor (going to try lowering effexor dosage and see what happens but it has pretty wack withdrawal symptoms)
 just came off wellbutrin and adderall (that was a bulimia bandaid) still on prozac (now mg) will probably be taken off klonopin though i use it rarely and i doubled my trazadone last night and slept awesome although cannabis helps me sleep really well and wake refreshed

 wellbutrin xl  mg and lamictal  mg daily for anxiety prazosin  mg nightly for ptsd nightmares following my sonus sudden death three weeks ago i briefly took xanax as needed to help with sleep which was very helpful
 psych meds amp; the immense privilege of access to care are the main reason ium alive amp; functionalni take mg of paxil mg of wellbutrin xl amp; exercise amp; sleep like my life depends on it nbecause it does 
 i had postpartum depression and anxiety a combo of wellbutrin (mg) and lexapro (mg) plus trazodone (mg) for sleeplate night panic attacks saved my life i only need the trazodone now
 funny you should mention bad side effectsi was on wellbutrin for one day and woke up from an uneasy sleep convinced that nanobots were driving my brain so no more wellbutrin for me ;p
 ium on mg wellbutrin and mg of effexor xr the wellbutrin was doing a good job on its own until i started sleeping all the time and having bizarre suicidal ideation and my anxiety was off the charts just that lowest dose of effexor has made a world of difference
 mg wellbutrin in the am mg zoloft in the pm baby dose (mg) of xanax when i cannot sleep due to angry seething
 wellbutrin and effexor also made me sleepy and on top of that wellbutrin gave me headaches it works well for others apparently but very much not me
 i'm currently on lyrica mgx per day for fibro savella mgx per day for fibrobetter sleep? i'm not sure if that's currently helping much wellbutrin mg a day for generalized anxietydepressionseasonal affective disorder
 took me about  months to really see the effects with cymbalta but finding it very effective now have tried prozac celexa wellbutrin trazadone in the past cymbalta works best for me but it does make me sleepy
  mg of seroquel mostly to help me sleep because my bipolar ii is much more manageable when i get enough rest right now that seems to be enough for mennbeen on lithium abilify celexa zoloft and wellbutrin with varying degrees of success
 i canut sleep please jesus just let me sleep is this a side effect of the wellbutrin?? i just took  dramamine so hopefully i can just get to sleep
 my sleep has been insanely irregular probably due to wellbutrin but at least i donut have any obligations in the near future so hopefully i can just sleep when ium tired enough and ride it out

 i woke up late today so i didnut take my wellbutrin until later in the day and now i cannot sleep
 my mg of wellbutrin means i don't sleep  hours in a day ntherapy chips away at my anxiety issues that actively keep me from creating nnthe idea that people have to suffer and struggle for art or that it somehow makes them stronger for it is bullshit 
 yo my sleep schedule on wellbutrin is fucked is this gonna improve over time yeah?
 anyway i'm feeling better today becausena) i got some sleepnb) my taxes got didnandnc) no cluenpops wellbutrinncmtn
 and yes i'm just randomly tweeting about my hair because i'm so tired my wellbutrin dose is absolutely too high i cannot sleep past am it's the worst
 adderall and wellbutrin for me i sleep pretty well i do get a little more anxious sometimes with adderall but ium not being treated for anxiety just depression itus manageable and feeling in control of my brain is worth it
 weirdnnmy one question is if you didn't remember dreams before is it possible you just weren't dreaming? maybe the wellbutrin is making you sleep better
 wellbutrin and sleeping  hours straight
 i had anxiety attacks all the time on wellbutrin so my doctor added mirtazapineuso much better and it helps me sleep at night
 the first step on my help i'm feeling way crappier than normal what is happening? flow chart always needs to be have you been taking meds properly twiceaday wellbutrin works better for me except when work happens and my sleep schedule is super messed up
 wellbutrin amp; trazadone (as needed for sleep) uddude

 this wellbutrin xr has got me feeling udeuddfantasticudeudd but i canut sleep soooo wtf
 oh yeah wellbutrin feels speedy as heck especially at the beginning i can see it having weird effects on your sleep
 i never had sleep paralysis when i was youngerit started in my last apartment (which had some creepy vibes sometimes) i think it had to do with antidepressants? wellbutrin in particular affects dopamine uptake
 weird that i took a zillion fragmented naps today and went outside once for five minutes and then took wellbutrin after pm and now it's after midnight and i'm tired and twitchy and can't sleep and don't know what to do with myself a mysterious and ineffable series of events
 wellbutrin gave me a seizure which ium not prone to and also made me sleep  hours a day while doing nothing for my depression i just started prozac and havenut felt anything good yet either this sucks
 me too re new antidepressants i've been on wellbutrin now for  months and it has truly helped all the best with yours re your hubby (or whatever you call your husband in the uk) i've beentheredonethat when i've not been bluesy  merely halfasleep again all the best

 i spent my first two weeks on wellbutrin in a state of anxiety but heightened energy and awareness and now im back to falling asleep at my desk
 ) i take my wellbutrin  and then fall back asleep because i'm a dumb piece of shit and can't live like real people or i'm disabled because mental illness is real who can know
 so it turns out i only got  hours of sleep once this week which explains why my brain is no longer presentnnone of these days i'll learn how to sleep while on wellbutrin
 that's a great question the ya has me so when she had running thoughts i sat there semi comatose while she rambled at me until she fell asleep since she's added wellbutrin it's helped her fall asleep without me
 pros of going off wellbutrin less seizing nncons not sleeping hella anxious depressionuufe0f no appetite dissociation irritableu
 ok i seriously have had the worst sleep this whole week and im not gonna take wellbutrin anymore
 agh i was on zoloft for a while and that shit did me dirty so i have an appt to switch to wellbutrin this weekbut i took them before bed ((where i have either eaten earlier or i can sleep and ignore the pain lmao))
 i exercise regularly i eat well i use sleep apps i follow a routine if i donut take my wellbutrin everyday i struggle to get out of bed if i donut take my adderall i canut keep my thoughts straight and canut focus long enough to be productive depression adhd
 i take wellbutrin and lexapro to manage my depression and anxiety because i have hypothyroidism i'm prone to fatigue lexapro makes me so sleepy but wellbutrin helps with energy and anxiety whatdoyoutake? 
 yeah for sure he should definitely talk to someone and should probably be on wellbutrin or something also for an adult man you can't just sleep like  hours a night that's not sustainable
 uddude0uddude0 yep  i had to wake up at ass crack early and haven't been back to sleep it's probably the wellbutrin shit has me feeling like i drank  cups of coffee
 me on zoloft waking up at  pm oh sick only like  more hours until i can go back to sleepnnon wellbutrin jolting awake after a light  hrs rest at  am i should be jogging
 wondering if itus too late in spring to start wellbutrin if i didnut worry about judgement amp; a paycheck iud probably sleep all day but bravo reality shows are a nice escape as well as lots of fiction
 omg sending you all the good vibes hey i just started wellbutrin buddies how do you like it? any effect on your sleep?
 no not at all and i haven't had any since my psychiatrist and the neurologist debated as to why i had the seizure; my neurologist said it was the wellbutrin while my psychiatrist said sleep deprivation or something else bc the xl version is less likely to cause seizures
 they've increase my wellbutrin to mg daily and it alwaya feels like i have had a cup of coffee but i have no problems sleeping pharmaceutical grade meth? or gift from god
 yaaaaaas to seroquel that shit is putting me tf to sleep at night and wellbutrin is making me not stuff my face all day
 i don't know how long you've been taking wellbutrin but i took it for a few years and it took me awhile to get decent sleep on it and my doc had to adjust the dosage once but in the long run i found that it helped a lot
 woke up early urgh at least it's probably just like  minutesnnfolks it was  and then nnwellbutrin tag teaming with the other meds to keep me tired by fucking up normal sleep
 does anyone else on wellbutrin find that it just makes them numb and sleepy as hell
 ive only been on wellbutrin before which seemed to work fairly well for me but we arenut going with it this time bc im already not sleeping enough and canut afford to lose my appetite heus starting me on effexor to begin with
 guys dont have caffeine wellbutrin and melatonin all together you will just be anxious and sleepless
 yeah i discourage docs from prescribing me any antidepressant other than wellbutrin  last spring i was given trazodone to help with my sleep but it did the opposite and made my psychosis worse
 turns out taking your wellbutrin at pm means sleeping at all before  in the morning is a silly stupid fantasy
 ok so since i started wellbutrin and buspirone iuve been experiencing frequent nightmares and trouble sleeping throughout the night(iuve never slept more than  hours in a night tbh) does anyone else experience this?
 ucin the st week after quitting wellbutrin you may need to sleep a lot and constantly feel tired your depression may be worsened and you might feel as if you arenut in your body your muscles may be tense and your mental state may not be clearudnnmy weekend
 i took a wellbutrin at  fucking am and ium nowhere near sleeping
 psych appt went okay i can't make a therapy appt for a couple weeks cause that's just how mental health services work uddude but they put me on wellbutrin and i got a refill on my sleep meds so uddudccnhere's to being fucking medicated again thank fuck
 ok had an appointment with my doc going on wellbutrin and he gave me trazodone to sleep so maybe maaaaybe i might get more than  effing hours of sleep tonight if not i rarely ever do this but it'll be wine time i am not doing the insomnia thing tonight
 im back on wellbutrin and have been losing a lot of sleep so i feel you
 iuve had really good luck with wellbutrin but a recent drug shortage made me realize it has to be the brand name xl not generic not immediate release not sr (sustained release) being on the sr was a nightmare anxious unable to focus depressed messed up sleep so bad
 wellbutrin makes me hyper and manic and aggressive and i couldnut sleep on mg so i cut the dose in half and i feel better now ium still somewhat keyed up and i have a hard time sleeping though gonna ask my dr to lower the dose farther
 hjbfyjmxh thatus so terrible the only ucstimulantud ium on is wellbutrin so ium big sleep
 day  on wellbutrin i keep waking up at  am before my alarm goes off normally i snooze it until  and barely make it to work or i sleep past it and don't go into work i'm not supposed to be seeing benefits until  weeks from now but here i am very awake
 apparently wellbutrin makes me talk in my sleep full coherent sentences
 iuve tried the first three ium currently on effexor wellbutrin abilify and trazodone (for sleep) i still have symptoms but iud say ium stable  of the time main side effect is excessive daytime sleepiness donut have any info on mj
 i'm on zoloft it does make me sleepy but it helps my mood sm so i just deal with it i'm starting wellbutrin tomorrow ajsdk and apparently that's supposed to help w energy talk to ur psych abt it if it persists
 i'm on a full bag of potato chips every two days habit i want to sleep all the time and there isn't enough caffeine in the world to stop me and i spend basically  of the day feeling like i'm on the brink of tears maybe i shouldn't quit wellbutrin??? drugs drugpolicy sad
 ah the irony of sleeping through your appointment w your psych to try and increase ur wellbutrin dosage uddude
 i started with zoloft which made me sleep and gain weight then to something i canut remember then effexor  no problems with the effexor but wellbutrin?  man the crazy dreams
 alternatively me when i was on wellbutrin and it gave me a psychotic breakdown or me when i was on prozac and felt like i was going to throw up every day and couldnut sleep
 omg if this shit makes me lose sleep the way wellbutrin did i swear to god plus i already get migraines ooooof
 i used to take it it helped me with sleep (and maybe depression honestly not sure since it was in combo w wellbutrin) but i felt i couldnut wake up until the afternoon felt super foggy udcudf0
 oh my god yuall be careful what genetic form of wellbutrin you go on i was given a different generic brand than normal  weeks ago and started sleeping all day like literally napping and then sleeping  hours and having completely apathy for everything but ium back now lmao

 i feel your pain i only sleep in   hour stretches that leave me feeling exhausted all the time fibromyalgia is the major cause but my wellbutrin (for major depressive disorder) doesn't help either udeudd
 it's a costreward tradeoff i guarantee you'd feel more depressed in the long term if you didn't have your visionnnthat's coming from one who also takes wellbutrin and requires trazadone to sleep every single night the tradeoff is worth it for me but that's a personal call
 just a few months but also my body reacts to everything like  (also didnut sleep for  days after starting the lowest dosage of wellbutrin) so fingers crossed youull have a better time if you ever want to stop taking it
 i have tested for nanemianvit db deficiencynthyroid disordernadrenal disordernsleep apneannall negative psych is all that's left but i'm on the max dose of wellbutrin xl and adding strattera just made me shaky i've started to accept it's just all in my head 
 i recommend wellbutrin it doesnut make you feel sleepy and doesnut make you gain weight (actually the opposite)
 seems like my new meds are helping bc i not only had energy and a little more focus today but i'm also genuinely sleepy and peaceful now that the sun went down??? wellbutrin more like spellbutrin am i right udduddaudcudfudduddfuddudde
 cpap is the first line treatment for sleep apnea  stimulants and provigilnuvigil help with lingering energy issues (andor comorbid adhd)  beyond that nonstimulant options for adhd are strattera intuniv wellbutrin

 wellbutrin problem  i'm not tirednnme needs some form of sleep before the gamennbrain so what if we just we on the elliptical for two hours that sounds fun nnbody the bed is nice but you know what would be better? a borgernnme 
 i was doing pretty well with prozac but it brought on rem sleep behavior disorder (we think) so i tried wellbutrin which didn't do much then mirtazapine which helped a little added venlafaxine to that and got a noticeable bump in mood may adjust dosage later
 sounds logical wellbutrin sucks as you say  i manage my adhd quite well with a few cups of coffee a day i can drink it right before bedtime and still sleep like a baby
 honestly wellbutrin can be good or bad for some people it is a stimulant specifically a synthetic cathinone (so think of it as bath salts) so it will increase your heart rate and risk of seizures dawg i lost a good amount of weight and no longer need as much sleep
 the insomnia side effect of the wellbutrin is very real sucks cause i wasnut sleeping anywaybut the hr extended release is def keeping me up i feel a lot less like killing myself thatus an amazing feeling i havenut felt in years
 i took wellbutrin a couple times and i could literally not sleep while taking it like once i just laid in bed for  hours not able to fall asleep
 omg i tried both of those and wellbutrin made me very cranky and i couldnt sleep and had panic attacks constantly viibryd i was only on for  week bc it made me dissociate hardcore rn i'm on lamictal and it's fine in some ways but i'm not  sure about it yet
 i swear they mixed up my wellbutrin with sleeping pills bc a bitch canut stay awake
 the wellbutrin alone isnut cutting it tried adding lexapro and that made me feel flat then prozac made me not able to sleep and slightly suicidal gonna hold off on trying a new med until some projects wrap up in june
 ium currently transitioning from lexapro to wellbutrin because lexapro makes me too drowsy i wish i woulduve mentioned this to my provider sooner so that i coulduve stopped falling asleep in my classes so much

 wellbutrin has some interesting side effects i am taking a newish antidepressant that also killed my powerful sweet tooth and it helps me sleep better i take it at night which i didn't with the others

 wellbutrin causes those things too amphetamine doesnut cause those in everyone esp if they already have adhd and itus shocking to me that a problem that can be solved w a mouth guard (esp when oneus asleep) andor magnesium (literally itus that simple) is being held up here

 idk what exactly your experiencing as far as what your diagnosed withnbut personally i take seroquel as an antipsychoticto help with sleep and wellbutrin for my antidepressantnthe combination have worked really well for meni've tried prozac but it definitely made me a zombie
 i was on  antidepressants (wellbutrin and ium blanking on the other) a few years ago and they did not help at all i felt worse became more suicidal i couldnut sleep and my sex drive was completely nonexistent which started affecting my relationship
 btw my doctor added wellbutrin to it a couple of years ago and for me that was the right combination (although my sleep was fcked for months until my body got used to it it was worth it for the mental relief though)
 used to take wellbutrin in the morning to smile and trazodone at night to sleep accidently switched them in a rush on moving day and struggled like hell to stay awake and function it works maybe too well lol
 as an example welbutrin did wonders for my mother (who took it as zyban a relabel for smoking cessation after anecdotal evidence showed it was effective for that) but was a hellish nightmare for me where i didn't sleep for a month amp; couldn't stop tapping my feet at all
 damn it wellbutrin stop making me want to sleep with everyone
 does anyone else just like  not sleep when theyure on wellbutrin bc this is very frustrating
 i woke up on prazosin so my ptsd combo is trazadone for sleep (but if i have  consecutive nights of nightmares on trazadone the next night i take prazosin) wellbutrin amp; luvox for depression amp; anxiety a beta blocker for blood pressure that also helps ptsd amp; xanax as needed
 i loved wellbutrin i just eventually had to get something else bc my body got used to it but it can make ur anxiety worse for some n may need to be paired w something for anxiety sleepiness is a common side effect for a lot of ssris but doesnut last too long
 for me it was a voice the only depression was about drs dragging out fixing it for so long messing with my serotonin was causing lack of sleep inability to tell dreams from reality and hallucinations wellbutrin caused no sleep
 ccidentally just took wellbutrin instead of lamictal so looks like i will just never sleep again
 always start the day with a balanced breakfast of too much caffeine sleep deprivation and wellbutrin

 i slept  hours and fell asleep for a couple more do i blame this on adjusting to wellbutrin?
 she put me on wellbutrin which helped with my energy levels (i mean i chronically clock in  hours of sleep on average) but hasnut helped me remain organized or focused on the intense work i have to do your thread is helping me reframe that
 i'm on wellbutrin and will start feeling depressed within days if i don't take it once i start taking it again it takes another few days to build up in my system i hope you get relief soon i hate it when i sleep all day and am not productive
 i fell asleep pretty hard  i wonder if it was because wellbutrin?
 i quit with zyban (wellbutrin) once also but while i took it i stopped needing sleep () and had messed up dreams when i did and also my emotions were an unpleasant roller coaster the entire time
 i'll self report here i asked my physician for medication and he first prescribed an ssri which put me to sleep at my desk then went the other way to wellbutrin which was what i needed i also took clonazepam which i had to take immediately if i felt deep agitation coming on
 i had been on both simultaneously then was taken off the wellbutrin and have been off and having sleep problems since then hoping doc will put me back on it everyone responds differently so give it time before deciding it it works or not
 accidentally just took wellbutrin instead of lamictal so looks like i will just never sleep again
 wellbutrin helped me with my anxiety but it made my depression a lot worse and also extremely irritable cymbalta made me suicidal and completely unable to sleep and constantly on the verge of tears
 i'm  it took years to find the right doc it got bad when i had breast cancer and part of the treatment was to take a medication that removed all estrogen i was a zombie for a year i take zoloft prazosin busbirone and use lorazipam to sleep many can't tolerate wellbutrin
 i tried it to treat depressionanxiety and the side effects mirrored my depression (low energy and sleepy all day) so i switched to wellbutrin and itus been a dream hope prozac works for you uddudcc
 there are several things i need to do regularly to manage the depression i've had for  years nnthey are get enough sleep eat more vegetables than i'd like exercise regularly have sufficient alone time to recharge my introvert battery and take mg of wellbutrin daily

 canut wait to talk to my psychiatrist tomorrow about reupping my wellbutrin and also how i fell asleep listening to the national album uchigh violetud
 when i took wellbutrin at age  i was sweaty and hyper and when i tried it again at age  it literally made me fall asleep idgi
 the wellbutrin kept me up a lot last night with feverish dreams ever like be half asleep and think you're talking to people and that you're completing a task but you're just having a fever dream??
 okay so anybody taking wellbutrin how were you on it? how did it interact with alcohol?ni want to try it but i don't want my sleep schedule to be  shades of fucked upnmy current anti depressant mirtazapine has made me hostile but works well
 i couldnut sleep for like two months after i started wellbutrin eventually my body got used to it but it took a while i could tell it was helping thatus the only reason i kept taking itnnprednisone also i straight up wonut take that vile stuff anymore
 might switch back to taking my wellbutrin at night because when i take it in the morning i feel slow and sleepy but not sleeping just sleepy feeling
 that was the only affect wellbutrin had on me and i was on mg no change in appetite sleep mood or legit anything but my libido
 wellbutrin really is that chick i know yuall mfs remember the first time you took it and you went from being severely depressed and sleeping all day erry day to bouncing off the fuckin walls uddude me when that wellbutrin hit for the first time uddude0 
 wellbutrin) an antidepressant that sometimes keeps one alert and needs to be tamped down at day endnnrecently i added a  mg melatonin tablet before bed and i sleep even betternnmy doctor says don't take the zolpidem until i'm actually ready to sleep ask around 
 wellbutrin and i canut sleep before midnight or eat more than one meal a day udeudda
 yes works great for real hsdd id say similar tolerability as antidepressant like wellbutrin  works in about  of those who take it can help with sleep and does have a small chance of mild weight loss my patients donut hate those side effects sexmed
 what wellbutrin does do is affect dopamine norepinephrine (and i think one more neurotransmitter but i'm too sleepy and pissed off right now to look it up) which is basically a lowlevel simulation of what adhd meds do seriously
 i love wellbutrin ium on the twice a day dose the most important thing iuve discovered is to take my second dose no later than lunch or it ruins my sleep itus a stimulant so youull have more energy but sometimes it can feel like anxiety my appetite also decreased udeuddudcudffcuduufe0f
 it's been a while but i didn't have an issue switching suddenly the prozac just kept me sleeping all the time but it was what my obgyn prescribed as emergency wellbutrin extended release worked to get me back to life again i didn't lose weight though
 my wellbutrin is kicking in and now i can sleep  hours and have unexplained energy all day you simply love to see it
 always forget to take mine until too late then have a terrible sleep also makes me randomly jerk when ium trying to fall asleep nnmy fav side effects tho are gaining weight and lack of sex drive nnjust great stuff that wellbutrin
 i've concluded that my wellbutrin is best taken in the morning instead of evening if taken in the evening it disturbs my sleep cycle
 i quit with zyban (wellbutrin) once also but while i took it i stopped needing sleep () and had messed up dreams when i did and also my emotions were an unpleasant roller coaster the entire time
 side effects of antidepressants so farnncipralex ium high af and canut cumnneffexor my sheets are soaked in sweatnnwellbutrin zap zap i canut sleep or stand up straight nnthis shit is a wild ride
 ium a pgy on wellbutrin since ms when i was so depressed i couldnut eat or sleep lost lbs and casually considered suicide as less shameful than dropping out now ium on wellbutrin mg do therapy and love my work but ainut gonna literally kill myself for it udeudduduufe0fuddude0
 my doc is pulling me off the wellbutrin (it was making my anxiety a thousand times worse amp; making my insomnia and migraines worse as well) so i'm starting new meds (fingers crossed) amp; this one is made to be taken at night (bc it can help with sleeping and can help with my anxiety
 i'm not sure if it's the full night's sleep the wellbutrin or the morning walk with the doggos but i feel pretty good this morning goodashell
 wellbutrin made me sleep for a month never got it refilled nnchantix scares the shit out of me nnlooking forward to your updates
 ah that's why everything is fucked i took my wellbutrin so late yesterday it had a chain reaction effect and screwed up my sleep
 wellbutrin lexapro and adderall get me out of bed but sometimes on the weekends i can sleep from friday night to sunday night itus scary
 i don't get sad but use a light box to try to regulate my sleep wake it seems to help keep things stable if not ideal i hope the wellbutrin helps uddudca
 light box seems to regulate my sleepwake a little better itus hard to tell vitamin d supplements helped a lot toonni just started on wellbutrin this year which has fda approval for sad soweull see how that goes
 day five on wellbutrin after fours of sleep and i've got to give a lecture and meet with my former adviser 
 normal canut sleep right eat right scared to go out ium screaming when i wake up and takes a while before english comes back to mennit never occurred to me that it might be the medicineni already had serotonin syndrome with wellbutrinnni better go back to my doctorugh
 i was on wellbutrin and it wasn't bad i feel like it leveled me out ni also had trazadone to help me sleep at night too was a great combo for me
 wellbutrin works well for me because it doesnut sedate me to the nth degree like every other one the worst was cymbalta extreme daytime sleepinessinsomnia at night missed a week of work when i first started it bleech
 i saw my psychiatrist todaynnwe increased my antianxiety med (luvox an ssri) kept my antidepressant (wellbutrin) and sleep med (trazadone) the same and discussed a plan to take more xanax than i have been (itus safe for me no worries)nnainut no shame in needing meds
 maybe not the right rx? i had to get off wellbutrin because it made me twitchy at night so i couldnut sleep so i got more depressed
 you got this  i take a xanax ( mg) at night sometimes to help me sleep  the dr prescribed them for nighttime anxiety  so i get it  xanax knocks y'a out  ask about wellbutrin  it worked for me
 taking my second dose of wellbutrin is always such a gamble  will i become superhuman and get all my work done? or will it beat me up and make me sleep? who knows
 my psych put me on wellbutrin and im not jivin with it at all its making sleeping almost impossible since th second i lay down i get ths rlly horrible nervousness tht keeps waking me up fuck ths shit man i just wna sleep
 i understand your pain i have been battling depression and anxiety for yearsi have been to counseling but it didn't help i'm on wellbutrin now to see is it going to helpi believe my sleep apnea triggered my mental disorders
 i had that problem with effexor years ium taking the lowest dose plus the lowest dose of wellbutrin(for motivational needs) so together dopamine serotonin and norepinephrine are all being tweeted nsleep apnea can increase anxiety and panic has she had a sleep study?
 it says that robitussin and wellbutrin has a moderate reaction and i forgot to take my wellbutrin earlier and need to take cough medicine so i can go da fuck to sleep and not have trouble breathing will i be ok
 i can't take my meds too close to bed otherwise i wont sleep i take wellbutrin to help my adhd and depressionmy doctor gave me gabapentin to help me sleep

 welp wellbutrin didn't last long unfortunately pretty bad allergic reaction filled with hives and throat swelling been itching for the last few days gotta see my doctor on the th to try something else out now for a benadrylinduced sleep since that makes the itching stop
 one thing i remember about wellbutrin was it didn't help at all except in making me not as interested in cigarettes and i could never sleep for more than  hours without waking up shaking in a bout of rage for never any reason god tier drug
 was wellbutrin working for you? i was on rehab in june and people were snorting it as uthe poor mans cocaineu forme ive had to stay away from those because of my tendency towards addiction? iuve also tried buspirone which is a less addictive xanax it made me sleepy
 i love wellbutrin so much but sometimes if i get excited about something just before bed no matter how hard i try i cannot sleep eventually i must relent and do something else because ium not gonna sleep regardless pro sometimes ium productive con ium extremely tired
 sertraline is zoloft? that was the st med i tried it made me so sleepy during day i fought it all day and even a nap didnt completely help i changed to lexipro  had sleepiness again then changed to wellbutrin (generic though) which doesn't make me sleepy
 ive heard wellbutrin and prozac together are a winning combo i tried them both separately and neither benefits outweighed the side effects buspar was the best for me but made me super sleepy right after taking so it always needed coffee alongside
 hi ium on wellbutrin carbamazepine straterra and hydroxizine so i basically oscillate frantically between yes hi im here to face the world  also my hands are shaking and uci need to sleep for eight years also my hands are shakingud
 well i was on the max dose of zoloft first and that did absolutely nothing and then it was paxil and that was absolute hell and then i was on trazodone for sleep and then wellbutrin and that worked the best tbh but it made my hands shake and made me nauseous the first  weeks 
 bihh wellbutrin i'm also supposed to be on lexapro but it make me sleepy (
 the crazy thing is i was on the max of z while being on the max of wellbutrin too so it was a weird phenomenon where i was gaining weight bc of being a tired zombie but also not sleeping and not eating it was a whole hot ass mess until i got my adhd diagnosisaddressed
 lexapro gt; zoloft gt; wellbutrin gt; lamotrigine gt; lamotrigine  vraylar (bonus points seroquel for ucsleepud)
 let's see zoloft wellbutrin and buspar (for anxiety) nnand then adderall for adhd ambien for sleepnativan as needed nnplus other meds for non psych issues
 remeron put me to sleep for  hours and i was borderline asleep for another ishnnbut i'm glad it works for younnand yeah psych took me off the seroquel recently while putting me on the wellbutrin because i didn't think seroquel was doing enoughnnsharp nosedivengood now tho
 i gave up and went back to wellbutrin my main problem was sleep apnea and fixing that helped the wellbutrin work properly
 wellbutrin causes sleep disturbances and will be an issue in alz ag docs know this migrainetrd is the value
 some drugs also have a catchy name to persuade you of effectsnnambien sleep aid  mangles anglo french ucammorning bienwellnmorning wellnnor wellbutrin for depression (bupropion not ibuprofen) nnlyrica will have you singing about your fibromyalgia pain reduction in no time
 when i went on wellbutrin i started having hallucinations and i couldn't move sometimes like i was having sleep paralysis but fully awake
 once this wellbutrin kicks in and gives me energy so i can work out and not sleep all the time and lose weight and be white boy of the month its over for you hoes
 update on wellbutrin i'm sleeping through the night and my mood is miles better but i just walked into the kitchen knowing i need to cook dinner and make cookies and i nearly cried i am so tired
 it sucks but for me it was better than eating my shotgun i had fewer side effects of that nature with wellbutrin but it made me crack two molars from grinding my teeth in my sleep
 i talked to my psych and shes prescribing me wellbutrin and a sleepingmed so lets see if that helps me any
 my doctor told me wellbutrin would make me sleepless but it made me really really sleepy all the time instead
 me too  coming off wellbutrin and sleep is spotty you are not alone and also you are loved uufe0f
 ok so wellbutrin makes me tired af for now i want to art but i also want to sleep for  years xd
 wellbutrin and a kitten seem to work really well in combo for me on that frontustay up all night kitten on your face at am can't lose (or sleep)
 ium on lexapro but i canut sleep and have always been forgetful u00af_(uc)_u00af same when i was on wellbutrin
 i was helllllla sleepyabsent minded on wellbutrin no longer on it but it was killer
 i took my wellbutrin like  hours ago and then went back to sleep and just woke up lolol
 i tried wellbutrin and it did just the opposite couldnut sleep short tempered violent and no it didnut help chantix made me bulimic not all these chemicals react to bodies the same way i have many drug allergies
 like i was on wellbutrin before i was fine and like i can tell itus working but i cannot fucking sleep sos
 me on wellbutrin constant migraines dizzy nauseous canut sleep ears ringing restless blurred vision always sweatynnme off wellbutrin too tired to function move or get even the smallest tasks donennmentalhealth medication uninsured ptsd adhd medtwitter
 wellbutrin didnut work for me i later found out i basically didnut sleep during the time i took it watch out for side effects
 yes lexapro and wellbutrin xl have helped immensely i donut have panic attacks anymore my other physical symptoms are under control like the bad muscle tension and the insomnia i no longer fantasize about suicide or sleep most of the day i no longer feel like
 i'm on dextroamphetamine and wellbutrin because my depression fuels my adhd and then my adhd fuels my depression and all i do is sleep so i have to be on something for both
 peter after drinking red bull is how i feel after taking a hydroxyzine for sleep last night and taking wellbutrin and prozac this morning i'm so glad i'm on medications that make me feel good and less tired we'll see if this feeling lastsnred bull clipn
 iuve been on wellbutrin for like  years amp; it was a rough start but i think the  weeks that i could barely eat or sleep was worth it plus itus different for everyone else and it was my very first antidepressant so i assume thatus why it was extra shitty
 wellbutrin is awful it had me falling asleep in public places these things effect everyone differently tho so gotta take every opinion with a grain of salt personally everyone i know who quit using chantix got back to smoking once off the chantix
 my brain is so negative and sleepy lately but ium beating her bc i started wellbutrin again and itull be in full effect in  more days pray for my thottie ass
 will delete laternnbut if anyone from work somehow found my twitternand are saying if you're this sick why are you on twitternits because my fucking wellbutrin wont let me go to sleep rn and i have to wait for it to wear off ok?nnu don't know my life 
 lexapro was actually one of the first i tried it made things worse and i was sleeping even more than usual somehow not fun effexor (venlafaxine) extended release was the first one to work greatuntil it didn't trintellix made sex boring wellbutrin amp; latuda currently uufe0fudcudf0
 awww i am an outlierneffexor and wellbutrin and sleep and emergency stuff
 speaking of depression i'm currently adjusting to a changed med regimen no more wellbutrin bumping up of effexor to  mgsnncertainly can't feel sad when you're sleepy (and drink white grapefruit juice forgetting it increases the drowsiness side effects)uddude0uddude0
 i struggled w fatigue for a large part of  these things had the biggest impact (in reverse order) low dose wellbutrin running multiple times per week(to improve sleep combat depression) same vitamin d dietary improvements (ongoing) cbt amp; other antidepression methods
 i wish your wellbutrin withdrawal was like mine i just sleep nonstop when i get to day  or  uddude0
 been there done that (with extra added sleep apnea no charge) have the tshirts thankfully got out of it fixed the apnea ketogenic diet exercise meditation some wellbutrin for a while high epa omega supps still a bit of each but manageable creative not crazy now
 wellbutrin was rough lol had my sleep messed up and anxiety through the roof along with the headaches udeudd
 does wellbutrin really mess up your sleep? i've been on it for a bit and haven't heard anything like that brain drugs are wild
 heh i smoked as much or more on chantix had weird dreams and was a bit of a jerk wellbutrin did fuck all for smoking nothing for my depression and screwed my sleep cycle and mood to where i was a violent asshole zombie but sure give em out like tic tacs
 so we upped my wellbutrin and i think itus likely been causing some amount of insomnia  but all that aside my annoyance of being awake at am before you have morning errands is really tempered by my cat is when he sleeps next to me stretching his feet out to touch me a little
 tried it wasnut for me nnfocalin was not as stable as adderal time released  wellbutrin did put me to sleep but groggy next day nnbest for me was vyvanse but insurance will not pay nngeneric time released adderall  is my go to  vs  for vyvanse
 try none  exersize more take melatonin for sleep  if you must try an antidepressant look at wellbutrin or ketamine  micro dosing psychedelics seems to work for some  good luck  (took paxil prozac and effexor  all were absolutely terrible   weeks and done for all )
 yeah if you could make it another week they might subside i know the transition sucks i didn't sleep for a week when i started wellbutrin my wife felt high as a kite for a week when she got on lexapro hang in there
 chantrix and wellbutrin gave me horrible nightmares and lack of sleep is not conducive to quitting cigarette smoking it's insane that this is one of the first advice recommendations that is given by medical community nonprofits amp; depts of health 
 never been on that one but wellbutrin works for me just keeps me level and able to control it no brain fog or sleepy just alert and happy
  three tries over  yrs after  yrs each time using wellbutrin had  also use a sleep aid though amp; i'm not at all otherwise a fan of rx also quit at time of another positive step like moving new job new relationship etc avoid other smokerstriggers (eg booze)
 i've started taking my wellbutrin twice a day (x morning  x night) as of today because my brain is plummeting so ferociously right now that i am literally exhausted to the bone and sleep isn't restful anymore i can't wait for my specialist orientation next week help plz dr
 okay i think the gabapentin makes me super sleepy not in the morning because it's with my wellbutrin but the afternoon and night dose i'm so ready for bed
 still feeling like barf there is a social function i've been invited to tonight but i'm still zonked the hell out on this wellbutrin detox i got a decent amount of sleep too it's like i wake up and am functional for a few hours and then my body's like yo it's malaise time
 either me or my mother has taken wellbutrin but i canut remember exactly lexapro worked the best for me but still not enough to justify me taking them and i smoke weed and that helps a lil but my tolerance is so high now  and iuve tried cbd it just made me sleepy lol
 so i was on this antidepressant wellbutrin and i loved it bc it was an upper and it made me not sleep and not eat and i was making lists and getting my life tg and then i almost had a seizure but like whatever anyway who needs wellbutrin when u can get a red eye from starbucks
 i take wellbutrin which doesn't make me sleepy but gives me bad dry mouth
 didn't take chantix  i did zyban it was really bad rage hallucinations no sleep bad dreams no sex drive constant sweating and more rage
 have you tried zyban? i know people who had a bad time on it but it got me off the ciggies the sleep deprivation amp; edginess for a few weeks was totally worth giving up smoking for almost  years nowni also hope you'll feel better soon those tears bursting days are the worstuddudcc
 zyban was crazy for me so angry all the time probably from not sleeping for a couple of months straight when i did sleep i had horrible bizarre super realistic nightmares so i'd wake up after about  minutes feeling like i'd run a marathon i had no sex drive(i was )
 wellbutrin lets me sit still for the most part but now i canut sleep cruel please just give me proper stimulant medication adhd is the only mental dx they put up so many barriers to treat
 backstory i was prescribed wellbutrin and to take it at night and i didnut know it was a fucking stimulant so i didnut know just to fuckin take it in tbe morning  iuve gotten threefour horus of sleep every night  i just learned about rhe whole stimulant thing today he he he he

 wellbutrin treating me pretty well but can i maybe get some sleep?
 lexapro and paxil both worked well for me paxil though had too many side effects to continue prozac caused full blown mania wellbutrin gave me nightmares and sleep paralysis and zoloft filled me with rage but i know people who had great luck with all three brains are weird
 i just started wellbutrin and am feeling so sleepy and tired did you have this experience in the beginning?
 just got my wellbutrin back can't wait to never sleep again yeehaw
 took a wellbutrin this morning immediately upon waking up and then went back to sleep for  more hours my brain is so powerful
 after trying a few different things i am on concerta and wellbutrin sometimes i will skip the concerta on the weekends so that i can get more sleep but i did have a bad adhd skip day a few months ago that reminded me why i take it to begin with
 the meds trial is exhausting but totally worth it i was on zoloft for awhile but itus made me feel ghostly wellbutrin has changed my life i used to sleep about  hours a day it helped with the ouroboros i was in i hope it goes well good luck uufe0f
 pristiq was the only thing that didnut give me adverse side effects i tried prozac zoloft lexapro wellbutrin and some others and all of them i reacted badly in some way to (nightmares nausea dizziness just didnut work too sleepy ect)
 iuve been on effexor for  yrs and now cut dose back and added wellbutrin with my xyrem  blood pressure and cholesterol too   cut back a little on adderall and armodafinil  frustrating   i have sleep apnea and fibromyalgia too  hotmesswaitingforsleep
 wellbutrin (buproprion) doesn't make me sleepy at all fingers crossed for you
 tuesdaywednesday (day ) i got fucked absolutely fucked my stomach? was fucking dying on tuesday and wednesday i had some left over stomach pain i guess the wellbutrin withdrawal symptoms started hitting hard too mostly because of the lack of sleepshitty food i consumed
 i for one love consuming over half a liter of masala chai and mg of wellbutrin and still being tired and unable to focus despite having an okay amount of sleep isn't adhd great
 day three of waking up early because of quitting the wellbutrin messing up (fixing?) my sleep schedule  i guess i make breakfast now? 
 was on zoloft and wellbutrin but i hated what zoloft did to my sleep so i stopped taking both in december and well i seem to be doing better? that's just my anecdote and i fully expect to be back on something sometime but i guess the need has passed temporarily udeuddeudeudde
 my wife did very well on celexa but it caused tachycardia i was on effexor for years amp; it didn't really do anything amp; then stopped doing even that i'm hoping i can switch from paxil to wellbutrin cos i feel like too much seratoin worsens my sleepiness and makes me angry
 i feel like i could sleep for a year if i didnt decide i was a doctor and i should take the wellbutrin at  when ai got it then took the seroquel to combat the hyperness that caused now i'm so far beyond out of it that i can't think but i have restless legs (
 metadate was a better release mechanism for me and afternoon grumps went away wellbutrin finally kicked in and presumably abilify started to level off the last of my emotional unevenness most recent appointment explained some small difficulty getting a lot of sleep ?
 u have bad skin bc u go to sleep w makeup on i have bad skin bc i was born at  weeks and im on wellbutrin we are not the same
 i was on aplenzin and i couldn't sleep for days
 wellbutrin is weird man all i wanna do is sleep and fuck

 i take mg of wellbutrin xl first thing in the gd morning and i stg if you donut fall asleep in the one minute window a day you will just not sleep ever  like a mfun eleven i was focused af at work today but paying for it now with only five hours to sleep smdh uddudea 
 did you yoyo wellbutrin? it made me a sleepy bitch'
 i meant to take the antihistamine that helps me sleep but i accidentally took another wellbutrin so then i tried to throw that up but it seems like i just threw up my dinner bet on if this will get me high in the replies 
 the chantix can cause that if you donut want your insurance to know you smoke you can talk to your doctor about trying bupropion (wellbutrin) which works for some people or try like otc nicotine products usually only the patches mess with your sleep or mental health
 answer to i've been taking wellbutrin xl for about  weeks and i love what it has done for me but it gives me insomnia even though i take it super early and limit caffeine any suggestions on helping sleep without a sleep aid? by belle gayer 
 wellbutrin xl said fuck sleep bitch
 wellbutrin increases energy so should be taken in the morning  many ppl have no problem with sleep if they take it early enough but some ppl r very sensitive to it
 same wellbutrin in the morning effexor evening their side effects kinda cancel each other but if itus just for sleep as opposed to depressionanxiety i donut guess youud need the wellbutrin? and yeah withdrawal is hard if not tapered down
 uddude lexapro gave me intense dreams and nightmares to the point that it didnut feel like i was sleeping at all nnthe only thing that ever worked well for me without side effects is wellbutrin itus in a different classification than other antidepressants
 finally took my wellbutrin after a week of not taking it cause of my fucked up sleeping schedule (you have to take it in the morningish bc it can make you stay up all night if you take it too late)nnalso finally took my other  meds after missing for  days cause i was depressed
 does anyone take wellbutrin?? i just started taking it and the pharmacist said to take it at night but i feel like itus making me wide awake where i canut sleep
 the actually being able to lose weight thing about wellbutrin nikki is great but i miss prewellbutrin sleep for  hours when you feel bad nikki
 i also take zoloft and definitely have issues with exhaustion even when i sleep  hours we upped my wellbutrin a few weeks ago and it seems to be starting to help with being tired all the time
 itus used to treat sleep disorders besides just being an antidepressant i take wellbutrin and my doctor prescribed me trazodone as well to help me sleep you should be okay but check with your doctor or try to research drug interactions online if youure concerned
 magnesium isn't technically a sleep aid it helps with bone health but i read a lot about people who said it helped them sleep so i tried it my dr gave me trazadone for sleep i had postpartum anxiety and took lexapro for awhile too now i'm taking wellbutrin
 ium on a combo of zoloft and wellbutrin for depression with ativan handy for anxiety i only take the ativan before bed so i sleep and can get out of bed in the am this cocktail has saved me exercise is also extremely important
 just putting this out there while lots of people including me had pros for wellbutrin more sex drive and less weight gain and more energy it for me had so many side effects that to this day havenut gone away night terrors flashbacks hallucinations sleep paralysis etc
 wow wellbutrin for the longest gave me very vivid nightmares every time i would sleep i was on it for about  months and ended up changing it to lexapro
 everyoneus different so it might be magic for you since wellbutrin i havenut taken any antidepressants since the paranoia and nightmares that lead to no sleep and hallucinations literally made me more suicidal just to make it stop in the moment absolutely awful experience
 validating to hear wellbutrin made me hallucinate some scary shit because i was so paranoid i didnut sleep for days uddude0
 zoloft made me so sleepy i felt like i was high as fuck  for the first month and anytime i increased my dosage after a month tho i felt fine pairing it with wellbutrin and ium golden
 wellbutrin  i lost weight and a normal sleep cycle
 just stoped taking lexapro for the first time since i was  to strictly do wellbutrin and i love it idk about the skinny part but libido is great and ur no longer a zombie nor do u sleep for  hours a day do suggest udeudd
 i used to be able to sleep until like pm before i started wellbutrin miss it udduded
 iuve heard only good things about wellbutrin tbh idk what it is but these ssris make it impossible to stay asleep
 fwiw when i've been on wellbutrin it has been like freaking magic for my ability to sleep
 breathe thru a straw eat sour patch kids when i have a craving cut back on caffeine (nicotine metabolizes caffeine quickly) to help sleep wellbutrin sniff black pepper essential oil look at pictures of people with tracheotomies use an app that keeps track of progress
 i think at this point now i tried vyvanse which worked great but i couldnt handle the crashappetite and sleep loss then adderall ritalin wellbutrin daytrana intuniv alone intunivadderall combo and modafinil which were all duds what do i even do now?
 hmmm part of my own issue is a lack of energy (i have some sleep disorders and a cpap machine etc) so the psychiatrist did say that it makes sense that i like wellbutrin because itus one of the few that can give an energy boost?
 talk to your dr about wellbutrin i had to add it to counteract the lexapro it worked but it made me sleepy your dealing with ptsd there is no one size fits all solution you also should couple that with longterm counseling uddude
 so now i'm on lamictal luvox and wellbutrinn(generic versions of course)nni've taken all my meds for about  days in a row maybe longer i forget a lot but i'm finally trying to set an alarm to take my meds my sleeping schedule and insomniamania certainly don't help ha
  ish weeks just on wellbutrin i have an emotional breakdown im trying to sleep and then a wall of emotions and colour hits me in a moment of clarity i take the cipralex at the dose prescribed with the wellbutrin to get me help in the morning

 i keep forgetting to take my wellbutrin cause i sleep at am and wake up at   and ium in an extremely liminal space in my life and ium starved of social interaction  lol
 i think adderall makes me sleepy uddudeauddudea gonna try to up wellbutrin instead next doc visit
 oh lexapro is a beast can i ask which antidepressant? i'm on wellbutrin and it is amazing totally hear ya on insomnia  not sleeping is way better than dealing with unmedicated depression now if only insomnia went hand in hand with productivityuddudec
 i could not sleep when i added wellbutrin even worse than when i've increased my adhd meds but i know it helps for a lot of people
 thats awesome  the thing is my seroquel doubles as a sleep aid  i take three sedating meds at night clonazepam gabapentin and seroquel and then effexor and wellbutrin during the day ium just still having racing obsessive thoughts amp; passive ideations
 wellbutrin?  insomnia cantsleep
 for me i had to try and find another because i could not handle how sleepy it made me my current stuff (wellbutrin) has been a lifesaver
 i went through this in college took a ton of caffeine pills and still fell asleep in class i had a huge tolerance had to wean myself off caffeine entirely and start over i was depressed wellbutrin helped a lot
 ok so like i was expecting to have a super productive day today bc i had a walk and my first dose of wellbutrin and coffee but instead i just feel sleepy and kinda spaced out 
  months off birth control and  months off wellbutrin uium starting to feel like myself again uddudefudcudffc so thankful that spirit guided me away from phrmaceuticals those drugs are programmed to keep us asleep
 why am i so sleepy? i ask myself while missing another dose of my wellbutrin
 klonopin worked a lot better for me when i was prescribed xanax i had to take it at night to sleep and feel the slight effects of it throughout the next day wellbutrin worked for me too
 i tried my best to enjoy my spring break rest build puzzles and play my video games that i havenut played in forever it was very niceni uufe0f light blocking curtains now i can sleep in again this helps compensate for the increased light sensitivity side effect of wellbutrin
 yeah wellbutrin totally did that to me racing heart and messed up sleep too
 god damn im maybe gonna try wellbutrin  an anxiety med bc wellbutrin is the only thing that doesnt fucking put me to sleep it seems
 i realized i was so tired and weepy not just because i didnut sleep enough and there is a global pandemic but also because i missed my morning wellbutrin so i went home and took it but actually i was tired and overwhelmed so i took my nighttime lexapro udeudduduufe0f
 i stayed on my wellbutrin the whole time this week is rough and your (happy) circumstances make it harder i took an rx for nausea that helped me sleep too it's an antihistamine amp; b vitamin combo it might help if you keep waking up way early

 i get weirdvivid dreams as a side effect to wellbutrin and theyure not always too bad but some are absolutely awful with similar themes to the ones you mentioned itus been happening for like  years and the stress during sleep from them doesnut help with my fatigue uddudeuddude
 iull be fine itus just wellbutrin itull just put me to sleep for the next  hours did it once after christmas last yearuddude 
 one of the side effects of wellbutrin is difficulty sleeping and i got  hours of sleep in the last  days
 i take max dose of zoloft and wellbutrin with trazadone for sleep
 i take wellbutrin most days it makes me feel sleepy nauseous dizzy and gives me severe headaches to migraines
 looking at photos of my face from weeks ago when i was still on zoloft amp; how physically sick i looknthat medication was the worst i hated it ium so glad to be on wellbutrin insteadnni sleep better no horrific side effectsnno fevers no stomach issues no fear of passing out
 wellbutrin would never let me sleep but when i had something traumatic happen i took my husbands trazadone and i was like in amazing sleep for first time in days
 i would relax my tongue and just keep thinking peacefully uci may not sleep but i am restingud sounds stupid but i was calm and not fretting about the passing hours nnfor other reasons my doc rx wellbutrin and zoloft i sleep like i havenut since i was a kid
 trazodone is the best sleep iuve ever had i take lexapro in the morning and that at night stepson takes it with wellbutrin works great
 it could be medications if you take them ive had these problems on all anxiety meds ive tried amp; only have stopped after ive went off them for a little bit udeuddudcudffbuduufe0f im currently on zoloft amp; wellbutrin and still have continuous dreams every time i sleep so im just used to it now tbhuddude0 
 wellbutrin got my sleep fuckt up
 wellbutrin day   fun udeuddnnow letus see if i can actually sleep udduded
 sometimes it takes a long time to get the right medication that works some anti depressants can act as stimulants wellbutrin has a reputation for that i suspect the not sleeping at night is a result of your body being thrown into menopause from the chemo
 i cannot sleep did i take my wellbutrin at night by mistake i feel wide awake
 mine always changed my sleep patterns (especially wellbutrin) because i had way more energy during the day and wasnut taking naps also always got really nauseous and couldnut eat the first week when i started them but ium also a sensitive baby when it comes to meds
 just took my meds for the first time in over a week one day of forgetting to take them turned to  and so on depression has been creeping up all i gotta say is thank god for wellbutrin and good sleep hopefully today is better mentalhealth
 ditto on wellbutrin i took it with a low dose of trazadone for sleep though and i think paxil because it gave me bad side effects of anxiety but those three together were a great combo
 smart arseuddude0 i tried to sleep i'm on these bloody stop smoking tablets  zyban and guess what the most common side effect? fucking insomnia uddudeb
 i highly recommend wellbutrin improves your mood a lot sleep better amp; make u more able to function uddudcd
 wellbutrin prozac sleep hugs
 they had me on wellbutrin to quit smoking a few years ago i went into the darkest place i've ever been couldn't sleep and started forgetting the most simple thingsnhave heard from other people that it was a similar experience when it was prescribed to them
 antidepressants made me more depressed i quit taking wellbutrin last week due to some unfortunate side effects nni've been sleeping better not crying as much and i don't feel like i'm in a fog nnone of these days i will find a medication that doesn't make me feel like shit
 i would say about a month it is possible that it might not be the right medication for you or you need a higher dose i take citalopram at night to help with sleeping due to anxiety i have a friend who has only done well on wellbutrin i hope it works for you soon
 wellbutrin is the worst medication iuve been on i canut sleep i constantly feel like ium on the urge of throwing up ium always on the edge of a rage fit and if i forget to take it i get sick but at the same time itus literally the only one that works amp; wonut give me a seizure

 the wellbutrin decides when we sleep
 i havenut been able to sleep for shit all week i fall asleep and wake up  hours later and thatus the end of my sleeping for the rest of the night i think itus because i finally got my prescription of wellbutrin (my antidepressant) and itus fucking with me

 yeah i've noticed that with the wellbutrin i've been on that for about  months now and it doesn't help my sleeping pattern has always been all over the place even as a toddler (i'm mid's now) the adhd meds i always found made me twitchy and unable to sit still
 i've been on wellbutrin for years which isn't great for someone who has preexisting insomnia either  but without that one i over sleep lol the new adhd meds are fairly new  and yeah it has been a roller coaster figuring those out

 i started taking wellbutrin so i wouldn't sleep as much i thought it would help me get up early and yet here we are
 and combined with adderall it makes me sleepy as soon as it hits my system i have to take a higher dosage of adderall to power through it and usually wellbutrin is thought to play well with adderall and increase the efficacy p
 in case you were wondering wellbutrin vivid dreams are a real thing and they're making sleep hard
 i don't know if you're taking any medications but i just got off of lexapro and went from sleeping upwards of  hours most days to being functional on  hours when i have to work nights that being said i'm still on medication (wellbutrin) which is known to decrease fatigue
 i love those videos must watch morenni'm always on the caffeine i drink far too much tea but coffee puts me to sleep uddude0nni'll look up wellbutrin thanks

 yes i am on wellbutrin no i don't sleep am i under arrest or free to go
 tonight is a flexeril and toradol night since i canut mix flexeril with trazodone because those combined with an xr effexor and xr wellbutrin would probably put me in the hospital with ss and ium really good if i never deal with that again hoping i sleep now
 mental health and obesity are linked nthere are many people struggling with issues we cannot see nnfor me most of my s (outside of work and school) were spent sleeping  i was on wellbutrin and effexor it wasn't until i realized i needed therapy  and a lot of it to work

 i havenut gone to sleep yet and i was wondering why and then it hit me itus because of my wellbutrin
 wellbutrinzoloft combo saved my fucking life and ability to get out of bed without chronic need to sleep and ptsd i didn't start any meds until i was  and i really wish i had it sooner
 day  contravenate a hefty breakfast and took meds with mini muffins again dry mouth is still a burden tired but not fall asleep and must nap tired like the first day moderate appetite
 oh prozac fucked up my dreams so much i had to get off of it i take zoloft and wellbutrin now  trazodone for sleep
 it's a pain because i take my lexapro before bed then the first wellbutrin in the morning when i wake up (basically when i'm sitting at my desk for work on days i'm working) and then i'm trying to take the nd one with dinner because it can cause sleeplessness b bed
 i'm on wellbutrin amp; prozac right now i need a damper on my emotions amp; it gives me energy to not sleep all day i do think that mushrooms showed me hope in a very desperate time plus it made my ceiling look like an absolutely gorgeous night sky full of stars lmao would do again
 i miss the energy wellbutrin gave me i could get  hours sleep and be good to take on the world
 i take mg of wellbutrin and mg of adderall every single day in addition to  cups of coffee and can still fall asleep on command ium exhausted at all times of my life is this a symptom of early death
 wellbutrin just makes me not sleep and limits suicidal thoughts but other ppl say to me it's like coke with rails on it for them
 well trying to sleep this morning was a no go (damn wellbutrin) i'll try again this afternoon
 take the drugs we want you to take or we'll label you drug seeking and you won't get anynni'm still hoping to get weaned off of wellbutrin it's supposed to help my focus it doesn't and it keeps me from sleeping
 the only thing i hate about this wellbutrin shit is how i am completely unable to sleep in anymore like i wake up and ium instantlyuddudcuddudc
 for reference my past medsnn wellbutrin (was actually like drinking a glass of water did nothing)n lithium (i donut remember much of  as a result)n trileptal (seriously all i did was sleep)n latuda (actually the flat girl from that  weed commercial)
 try seraquil at night along with trazodone it helps me sleep during the day i take wellbutrin and buspirone for the anxiety
 my sleep has been almost non existent since i started wellbutrin working out has helped so much last night i felt tired for the first time in a long time
 first day taking wellbutrin and idk if it made me sleepy or if it was the sun because itus so damn hot in albany
 my meds are helping so i havenut had full blown eps in a while butttt does anyone have any experience with taking wellbutrin ium thinking of switching lexapro to that bc it makes me soooo sleepy and groggy
 iirc wellbutrin turned me into a zombie i was sleeping around  hours a day and had no energy but like all meds iuve known other people who react really well to it
  hours of sleep ghub on the way wellbutrin failing to do its job prazosin failing even hardernnyep it's time for eureka
 anyone else on wellbutrin andor lexapro and be having the most vivid dreams every single night also wake up all the time in ur sleep or is that just me
 anyone else thatus takentaking prozac what did you do to help ease the tiredness from it? (i donut get great sleep and ium sure thatus a lot of it but when i was just on wellbutrin and got bad sleep i still never felt this tired)
 new dose of wellbutrin you can have some energy as a treatnme yaynwb also the executive dysfunction? we're gonna ease up on that wash a dishnme yaynwb also here's constant anxiety and i'm gonna fuck your sleep schedule and it's gonna be this for a week bye
 right now taking mg every morning and it lasts for about  hours depending on sleepfoodbusynessetc not taking any other meds at the moment doctor recommended gradually moving up to mg twice a day potentially adding clonopine at night and wellbutrin if needed
 (i always take my morning pills fwiw but the afternoon dose is sooo easy to forget and i can't take it too late in the day or i can't sleep anyway bless u wellbutrin)
 bonus features trazodone for sleep and wellbutrin to stay awake whew my neurons are shitting themselves
 was taking lexapro and it made me sooo sleepy all the time i barely had enough energy to stay awake for  hrs a day ium on wellbutrin now but can someone explain y its not great? looked on reddit but all the threads r blah
 i take it for anxiety and have for a few years now i think it has definitely helped but the beginning was a difficult and emotional adjustment my biggest side effect was being sleepy so my np also prescribed wellbutrin and i found that helped a lot
 the first time i was prescribed prozac it was nice and i was fun tional i was off it for several years before i went on it again but this time it made me sleep all the time nni'm on wellbutrin now which has been really great for me udeudduduufe0f
 me  w mg zmg for about  years zoloft makes you sleepy wellbutrin perks you up but some eople gain weight zoloft can also cause vivid nightmares and loss of sex drive recommend take with food not after food and earlier in the day so you sleep is less affected 
 mg of wellbutrin should be illegal i have not eaten more than one meal in  days i cannot fall asleep until am even if i take the pill at like am i cleaned my entire apartment today and didnut even realize i used too much bleach until i passed out
 lexapro was hell for me to take during the day i would get to work stare at the computer and literally fight sleep (even with the wellbutrin it was no match for the sleepiness i would feel) and i guess the feeling nothing part makes sense the dr told me to take the extra 
 my wellbutrin makes me hate people less so that i can function at work i take the lexapro at night so i can sleep because if not all of my personalities will stay up all night talking to each other
 it would be great if wellbutrin could justnot cause acne and bad dreams cus not being depressed is sick but my skin and sleep are a hefty price to pay
 i took wellbutrin omgosh many many years ago i did have problems sleeping while on it as well gave me the jitters too didn't like it but that just me meds effect all people differently i hope and pray it works well for you uddudef uddudcc
 i also take wellbutrin along with zoloft which helps with the sleepiness
 there kind of myths have been held be society for ever but any reaction of drug induced psychosis from wellbutrin example would severely low blood pressure put him half asleep barely able to hold him self up
 i am  running on postsleepless night delirium and wellbutrin but ium feeling hopeful and healing rn sending all yuall some good vibes so we can share uddudc
 wellbutrin makes you a morning and a night person no sleep required udeuddudcudffbuduufe0f
 get me my wellbutrin right now ium sleeping  hours a day and eating everything
 i was on wellbutrin for about two years i loved it as well but had to get off of it cause it gave me crazy insomnia (of which i already have) it made it much worse and i'd stay up for days then i'd crash super hard sleep for days as well lol
 wellbutrinbupropion is the only antidepressant i know of wo major possible side effects the only side effect i had at first was elevating mania a bit (because it's a stimulant not an ssri) as a stimulant it can also increase anxiety tho anxiety meds usually make you sleepy
 i used to take lithium and zoloft and while i could still get fired up i seriously couldn't cum unless i went at it for hours pure hell looked like a burn victim wellbutrin fixed that issue for me and kinda acts as a counterbalance to the sleepytime meds
 thatus a major issue that has dominated my thoughts i was told wellbutrin would make me productive and horny but also increase my siezures i said ucgive it to me anywayud and instead he gave sleepytime horninhibitor antidepressants prevatine or something
  the cops fault if they weren't being dickwads you wouldn't have had to protest all weekendnni don't get that anymore i get sad sometimes if i forget my wellbutrin but if i don't take the other stuff i absolutely won't sleep so i need it every night
 woke up with a really severe headache (allergies) and wasnut really paying attention when i went to take meds i accidentally took a sleeping pill instead of my wellbutrin something iuve never done before today will be interesting
 literally the combination of me adjusting to wellbutrin  everything happening rn it is fucking impossible for me to wind down amp; go to sleep
 day  contravendisturbed sleep so a little on edge today going to start swimming for exercise wish me luck
 day  contravenwoke up with zero appetite half a banana cup of hot cocoa nndry mouth as always still sleepy
 day  contravensleepy nnwoke up with overnight oats and didnut even eat half of it very filling caprese for lunch rando green grasshopper walked out of my salad so at least i know itus fresh uddude0
 contrave isnut a thermogenic it actually makes me hella sleepy uddudeuddudeuddude
 the wellbutrin is def more for focusenergy lexapro made me too sleepy by itself
 oddly enough stimulants kill your appetite and interrupt sleep even when taking early i guess my point is that there are other options or regimens so that you arenut so heavily reliant iud start with tapering down and augmenting with mg wellbutrin if i were your doc
 rd day in a row where i get an hour of sleep and pass out for  later now i remember why i stopped taking wellbutrin
 i realize itus almost  but pls take your wellbutrinxany and put on your cpap  youuve had a long day and letus get some sleep good night cuteness
 ps are you on wellbutrin bc wellbutrin honest to god changed my life like i still wanna die and canut sleep or eat but only lowkey now lmao
 wellbutrin is a weird one to get used to imo when i started it they put me on another antidepressant to take at night that was supposed to help me sleep canut remember what it was anymore it was technically a superlow dose of an antipsychotic and it knocked me tf out lol
 did the google side effect of wellbutrin is trouble sleeping so its probably that maybe it'll take time for your body to acclimate the side effects?
 i'm not emotionally struggling i think the issue is that my doctor added wellbutrin last week on top of my zoloft and i feel mostly great but i think it's affecting my sleep 
 lol yeah i'm usually a  hours of sleep kind of girl and even then i take a long time to perk in the morning  if i remember right from last time i'm not always this energized on wellbutrin but certainly more than normal
 day one of restarting wellbutrin woke up absolutely pumped after  hours of sleep
 i had what my partner called convulsions i just could not sit still i felt like my inside were vibrating and couldnt sleep i stopped taking my wellbutrin after a particularly rough night ironically id taken the benadryl to try and help me sleep and it seemed to make it worse
 i couldn't last  days on mg of wellbutrin because it made me manic afffff it was fucking terrible now i'm on zoloft and sleeping all the time and can't eat solid food uddude
 i took seroquel when my ptsd was really bad ium zoloft wellbutrin with a touch of clono to put me to sleep effexor made me crazy udeudd iuve got a box full of stuff i take but i take everything at night plus stuff for my heart epilepsy and ra otherwise ium quite healthy uddudec
 fun new life hack if u take ur wellbutrin at pm and can't sleep till am just take ur next dose b u pass out at am and suffer thru  hours of sleep ua
 ugh i loved wellbutrin mentally but it gave me so many physical side effects i felt the same abt not wanting to eatsleep and was always sweaty and just way too energized but ium hoping it works out for u bc it rly did help w my depression
 trintellix wellbutrin and latuda plus a little thing for the daily nausea and a bit more for sleep pharmacy loves me mentalhealth
   does wellbutrin work?  can it help one sleep at night?
 i think part of it might be because ium on wellbutrin and concerta and so the wellbutrin stays in my system i definitely can tell certain weekends when i skip the concerta though like if iuve been super busy and want to be able to sleep in my brain just crashes for the day
 fuck im horny today curse you wellbutrinand tired even tho i've gotten good sleep for the past two days
 congrats that's awesome do you mind me asking what meds you take for the adddepression? my doc mentioned wellbutrin covers both? thinking about going back on them but i've been in a better space since kids back in summer school and i'm getting more sleep
 medication (wellbutrin) and a lot and i mean a lot of exercise and even then my sleep is mediocre at best but more than 0
 happens to me too with my wellbutrin canut sleep for shit when i donut take melatonin  some weed
 i had a similar experience with wellbutrin i canut sleep properly to this day
 a lady at least  months pregnant went to her gp for a routine check up whilst chatting she mentioned problems with sleep gp prescribed sertraline (zoloft) which caused weight gain amp; other horrible symptoms gp then prescribed to wellbutrin violent behaviour ensued uddude
 lmao i was on wellbutrin but my concerta was mg xr (and eventually adderall) and also throw in cipralex seroquel a bunch of valerian to fall asleep abilify lamotrigine and lost like lbs in like  months? because i was vibrating and could only stomach unsweetened iced 
 snris are wild man effexor? always asleep and canut cum wellbutrin? good thing iuve got insomnia because if i donut get off  times a day iull die but hey at least that helps with the headaches
 guess i'm probably experiencing my first true side effect of wellbutrin after  days  a pretty obnoxious headache so far it's gonna pretty well though i've felt more alert  slightly too much to where my sleep is kinda funny and i had to cut down on caffeine to outweigh it
 i'm pretty sure he's been diagnosed with bipolar disorder by physicians no shame in that he might need medication(s) he's not getting i've been diagnosed by  doctors with ptsd amp; i take wellbutrin it saved my life i went from  hoursday asleep to normal energy in a week
 have successfully replaced sleep with wellbutrin and caffeine anxiety is in full force this weeknnthings weure just not gonna talk about include the dark circles under my eyes and how easily i burst into tearsnninsomnia mentalhealth
 i fully think hash is a pos pedo but i will say that trazadone is an antidepressant as is wellbutrin vestaril can be prescribed for anxiety the real kicker is  of the time trazadone is prescribed as a strong sleep aid weird to give it to someone who od'd on melatonin
 it seems that wellbutrin makes it hard for me to sleep at night a small sacrifice to pay for not being mondo depressed
 my problem is ium on once daily wellbutrin so if i sleep too late i donut take it bc i donut want to mess up the dosage which then messes up the dosage lol
 i have depression anxiety adhd and ocd lmaoo i take  mg of wellbutrin  mg of buspirone  mg of concerta and at night i take  mg of trazadone because i canut fall asleep without drugs )))
 idek what to talk about tbhnmy wellbutrin isn't working as fast as i hoped they would i just want to sleep and stay asleep i miss uu church because that was the only socialization i had i can't talk to my friends as much anymore and i just want to be happy
 it seems wellbutrin has a thing where it is known for reducing sleep but increasing the quality and effectiveness of it
 yes i took wellbutrin and had insomnia  lucid dreams that required a sleep aid i've taken a few different drugs since then but the sleep problems stayed i'm on the generic form of prozac now and still take a sleep aid (a nonnarcotic) i'd ask your doctor if you can

 i'm sorry to hear of this you may possibly need some kind of anxiety medication i take two tablets of lamotrigine one tablet of lexapro and one tablet of wellbutrin each day they help me feel not as anxious and depressed i also take oxcarbazepine and melatonin for sleep
 i can sleep in but if i donut take my wellbutrin on time i turn into a grumpy gilda soooo

 so an email has been sent to the doctor two weeks ago she said that if thereus still no improvement then sheull be adding wellbutrin to my prescriptions i just want to sleep and for my depression to finally go fuck off i wanna be happy i canut sleep
 im pretty sure most antidepressants make u sleepy as a sideeffect cuz like   b fair u cant be depressed if ur knocked out  both effexor and wellbutrin make me go zzz sleepy time 
 my sleeping schedule is the best itus been in years i lost  pounds i donut run out of energy after talking to one person and itus easier for me to make long term decisions i fucking love wellbutrin
 what do folks on wellbutrin think about it long term? i've noticed that an adrenaline rush will throw me into an anxietyanger spiral which is newnni think it's fucking up my sleep as well or that it it's at least amplifying all of the bad side effects of caffeine
 no thoughts tonight wellbutrin is finally letting me sleep
 jaw clenched and was sore cosntantly and made me just feel out of my mind wellbutrin gave me the worst anxiety and made me clench my jaw and i wasnut able to eat at all trazadone helped me sleep but made me violently suicidal effexor just made me sick itus really trial
 this was great performitive virginity you did seem a little sleepy i miss wellbutrin except for the shaking
 my meds were adjusted to add wellbutrin so the big question is while i'm adjusting what should i do with all this new free time that i used to spend sleeping?
 i would start yawning nonstop nearly exactly  hours after taking it it was surreal lol my psych gave me wellbutrin to offset how sleepy it made me and the two together worked really well for my body nnloves playing chemistry experiment with our brainsss
 prozac made me suicidal mirtazopine made me hungry and sleepy zoloft did nothing wellbutrin made me anxious currently on lexapro and ium doing good 
 i took lexapro for like  years was always tired and did nothing for me but i was a kid so i didn't know better they put me on adderall to cancel out the sleepiness dudennwellbutrin was ok at first but over time it gave me chronic constipation and eventually anxiety bad
 might sleep tonight only the wellbutrin may decide

 wellbutrin can increase your rem sleep and can induce nightmares too itus highly common for bupropion you should definitely talk to your therapist about this if it continues
 wellbutrin when i complained abt sex drive problems and it made me so anxious i didnut sleep right for months because it gave me such severe anxiety abt dying in my sleep

 it's not exactly a sleeping med but the olly stress gummies are just so good their sleep gummies are good too but i feel like the stress ones are wonderful (sometimes i use both) i'm on wellbutrin and i haven't had nightmares on them (and i am prone to that)
 i misread your tweet welbutrin didn't help my depression or stop me from smoking never tried zyban doc has me on trazodone now (with the added benefit of sometimes helping me sleep if i double the dose which the doc approved)nnif you need to chatvent you know i'm here

 yes when i was on wellbutrin in hs i experienced a lot but also sleep paralysis one of the most terrifying things iuve ever been through awake but body canut move feels like it lasts an eternity 
 my wellbutrin side effects was i was just a soft sleepy zombie so it wasn't working and i got to try something else most side effects aren't that bad or even noticable the one i take now just gives bad stomachaches if i don't take it with food but works amazing for me
 i'm not surprised you're left with those side affects then i've been also on zoloft prozac effexor and lexapro for depression and others wellbutrin was to try to quit smoking once trazodone was because i needed help sleeping after the last med i can't handle anymore
 alright ium going to my functional medicine doctor i see where this is goingntake one drug (wellbutrin) so you need another one to help mood (lexapro) then you need another to help temporarily increased anxiety (ativan) then you need another to help you sleep (hydroxyzine)

 so far wellbutrin feels like i had an extra cup of coffee i am a little jittery but no longer like i must sleep now at  pm also more focused though that isn't saying much since i had the attention span of a gnat

 nothing has motivated me to fix my sleep schedule like my brand spanking new wellbutrin prescription has
 i haaaaaate when you take a new med and it fucks you up ive been on wellbutrin for years in combination with another medication and honestly im not sure what it's doing for me it's supposed to give me a little more energy apparently???? but i sleep all of the time lol
 it does make me pretty sleepy but the drowsiness wasnut too much of an issue for me i do take wellbutrin in the morning which wakes you up a bitnndefinitely remember to take seroquel everyday whenever i missed a dose i would start to feel like i was mildly sick
 i used to take seroquel as both an antidepressant and a sleep aid it really helped me sleep but i felt like my body was made of lead the next day now i take wellbutrin xl celexa and lamictal and i can manage things okay keep going day by day do your best
 i have been sleeping so much more since starting wellbutrin
 weird thing about wellbutrin is that i get super tired and then i canut sleep for hours
 going throughout your day and zap what was i doing? going off ssris was terrible i've been on an snri (wellbutrin) and it hasn't been as bad i went on extended release so i could sleep though
 wellbutrin discontinuation update i can not fucking sleep
 can't sleep i think it's the wellbutrin uddude
 wellbutrin it helps quit smoking it might make you a nervous wreck and it'll fuck with your sleep if you take it before bed it worked pretty well for me but causes heart issues if you overdose on it if your friend is suicidal help them regulate how much they have on hand
 iuve been struggling to sleep lately because of heat and horniness jerking as my room approaches  is no fun leaving me to do it late at night over and overnnon the plus side this probably means the wellbutrin is working well
 haven't tried wellbutrin but adderall makes me anxious andor spacey if i don't get enough sleep  don't eat enough  xr helped me with timing otherwise it works fine honestly but figuring out correct dosing sucked bc we overshot and i had to deal with it for a few weeks
 i have the adhd trifecta st time on wellbutrin it gave me powers to get  hrs of sleep and be fine that went away as it started to work ium able to get through the day better if i take it with coffee in the morning idk why but i tried it w other caffeine not the same
 the sleepiness is handsdown the worst symptom for me it's hard to do good science when you're nodding off at your desk uddude wellbutrin has helped that but dialed the hyperfocus up to  fingers crossed we both get the chemicals our brains need soon
 she was trying to get me to take wellbutrin originally but i declined bc i've heard so many horror stores she also wanted to give me ativan and i said no bc recovering addict but regretting it big time now with the inability to sleep
 panicking bc i thought i missed a dose of wellbutrin bc i accidentally fell asleep before i could when in actuality ium just sleep deprived and very forgetful
 i take two kinds prozac at night and wellbutrin in the morning the prozac makes me sleepy but the wellbutrine is really energizing
 adderallwellbutrinthree cups of coffee hrs of sleep and weure ready for the day
 wellbutrin got me on that no sleep grind uddude
 i find myself staying awake later while being super tired and having trouble sleeping when i do fall asleep not sure if the headaches with that are another side effect or the nerve block shots wearing off wellbutrin
 few years back i was on wellbutrin and thought everything was well realized turned me into a robot social and managing the sleep i got wasnut quality and i couldnut wait to take another pill uddudca burning candle at both ends
 that's a solid combo i used to take wellbutrin amp; lexapro for me it had it's benefits (wellbutrin was fantastic for weight loss i got down to lbs) but it also made me anxious amp; unable to sleep currently on effexor xr amp; vyvanse
 day  of being on reduced wellbutrin and i'm basically falling asleep at work sleeptron needs awakening
 first day without wellbutrin after slowly coming off last  days gut still feels nauseous will be finding out wednesday next trial of antidepressant to try still on trintellix and latuda plus ziplicone for sleep sicknotweak

 i miss sleep so much  i wasn't sleeping before wellbutrin either though
 throwing that wellbutrin sr out rn cuz it's am and my mind is racing and i just did the mister and genie choreography for whatever fucking reason and i still can't sleep xl did not do this to me
 it also had quite a few side effects (sleepyness mood swings bedroom stuff) that i wasn't quite happy with talking with other people and revisiting the doc i got put on wellbutrin which is aimed more towards depression i love it makes me feel so much better ()
 vyvanse is like a sleep aid for me adderall can be too but vyvanse is like almost too effective itus nice tho right now ium on wellbutrin and i actually really like it but i hope to up the dose
 wow i was just replying to a thread about wellbutrin that i took for years to stop recurrent nightmares that were the result of mild (very) ptsd nnit's crazy being afraid to go to sleep try a pharmaceutical or sleeping pills?
 eventually went to sleep at  am had a freak out the moment i closed my eyes and realized my eyes were closed but i couldnut fall asleep (because wellbutrin loves insomnia) also big disturbing mental image energy but thankfully no nightmares we love coasting on  hrs of sleep
 i can never sleep whenever i update my wellbutrin dose 
 i just started wellbutrin and i'm loving it so far i've had bad issues with energy and not sleeping  and now my sleep schedule is already better
 little bit its mostly just that i'm more sleepy than usual the wellbutrin takes the dge off the exhaustion at first i didn't think it made a difference but the first time i stopped taking it i was like oh shit it actually does help a little uddude
 i take  seroquel  wellbutrin  aleve  prevacid (temporarily after nearly asphyxiating on my own stomach acid last week while i was sleeping) and  melatonin gummies  i was taking cbd ones but they made the heartburn worse  i'm beginning to feel like i'm old
 help i canut sleep bc my wellbutrin dose went up so we could lower my adderall dosage and work on my appetite but now i canut sleep adhd sucks okay
 the wellbutrin sleep issue side effects are kicking in and they are no joke i may wake up  times every night and never sleep past am again udeudd but at least i wonut be in a major depressive episode
 i like wellbutrin helps me sleep and my mood swings are better but thatus why i hate big pharma they prescribe drugs to counterattack the pills you are on now hell there is a drug out there now that if the depression drug you are on now isnut working you take this also

 so wellbutrin has kept me steady for ages now but i gotta say two days back on trazodone too and i feel like ium in a pleasant daze and i canut decide if itus psychological or from finally getting multiple days of  hours of sleep
 i finished my sleeping pills and switched over to melatonin but melatonin is not doing itus job so i turned my kitchen upside down looking for a benadryl only to find a rogue wellbutrin at the back of a cabinet my insomnia started with wellbutrin nice one universe

 with wellbutrin make sure to keep a close eye on your sleep 
 okay at this point i'm like  certain it's the wellbutrin if i don't go to sleep by a reasonable hour or miss my second dose my brain goes full on catastrophic panic mode the second i get a moment of peace and quiet

 my wellbutrin making me trip out while sleeping dude ium talking so loud in my sleep itus waking me up lol
 wellbutrin i would sleep  hours a day and still be painfully tired i couldnut make it through the day without a nap within a week of starting wellbutrin i felt normal again it was unreal i love it to this day it doesnut work for everyone fatigue isnut well understood
 i've been up at am on the dot for the past week? has it been all week? and i'm so tired and i want to sleep but i can't (ni'm pretty sure this is a side effect of the wellbutrin now that i'm taking the evening dose again hopefully my body will adjust
 my psychiatrist upped my wellbutrin dose a while back and i had trouble sleeping couldn't fall asleep then tossing and turning all night it was awful so she took me off of that and gave me some ambien and that worked incredibly well solved all my sleep issues
 i tried lexapro first and kept raising the dosage until i mentally broke down and got a psychiatrist and psychologist to work together with me they switched me to zoloft and my sleeping problems got worse so they added wellbutrin it's been going good for about a year now udeuddudcudffcuduufe0f
 telling my man i canut sleep without him yet knowing full well itus actually the wellbutrin iced coffee amp; evening nap i took
 took my wellbutrin at pm today which means i will never sleep again
 all of this is  valid and helpful reminders i've been on the medicinal roulette for almost a decade now so i've been on this stupid rollercoaster for ages prozac and wellbutrin so far have been my best combination but the sleep thing had me fucking with it again
 i take trazedone at night because if i donut actively try to sleep on strattera  wellbutrin i will just stay up all night until all of the sudden itus the next day
 took myself off of my wellbutrin a while ago because it was causing a lot of problems when i tried to sleep then took myself off of prozac because my sex drive is nonexistent and now i have no sex drive and cry a lot and feel like a shell
 did anyone actually like wellbutrin? (i just recently started taking it amp; so far i feel more awake amp; in my body than i did w ssrius) i think iuve been more nauseated lately tho iuve always been a poor sleeper so i canut rly comment on that
 wellbutrin was alright but it did funky things with my sexdrive and i didn't like it also made it nearly impossible to fall asleep
 wellbutrin is fun bc you will never sleep or eat again
 like for me wellbutrin was a hell demon drug that made me stop sleeping entirely but iud never tell someone whose life was changed profoundly by it that theyure a fucking liar
 iuve been on it for over five years now along with wellbutrin and zoloft only side effects iuve experienced are nausea and sleepiness
 ium on wellbutrin amp; have a ton of issues w sleepiness it could just be you know the mental health strain thatus treating but that might be it too?
 are you on wellbutrin for depression andor anxiety or for help quitting smoking?  sleeping for  hours straight could also be related to diabetes (are you prediabetic?) andor pain (do you have any autoimmune diseases which cause inflammation?)
 quitting wellbutrin day  a little bit sleepier a lot more gayer? feels in general but i've mostly felt gay today
 wellbutrin is the only medicine that makes me feel alive so sorry for everyone who has to put up with my no sleep short temper and constant panic
 my sleep deprived brain while writing a letter  a pt i misspelled buproprion (wellbutrin) as burpoprion  then after a quiet giggle thinking burp that's funny) got lost in thought about whether i'd misspelled it that way b  lost a good min on tangential daydreams
 new update took a cbd calming pill an ibuprofen and my lexapro and wellbutrin will probably sleep tonight if not i'll update again soon 
 if itus been more than  months of your current meds you made need to go in for an adjustment some formulas just arenut quite right for your system i canut do lexapro; wellbutrin amp; trazodone let me feel more good days have less bad days sleep at night lows are terrible thouddude0
 today after starting an increased dose of wellbutrin for adhd i woke up naturally after sleeping for  hours and like  stayed up???? is this how other people start the day????????
 but honestly i donut think ium happy because something drastic happened i still experience happiness but itus not usually while ium alone i actually need something to take the edge off not like you know wellbutrin or risperidal for sleep but you know thatus all i can get
 i was on lexapro  wellbutrin for a while and it worked pretty well but made me so sleepy so a couple months ago i switched to prozac and so far itus been real good
 exercise even though it is the hardest thing to make yourself do vitamin d is a good thing to stay on top of too wellbutrin made me feel better for a while but fucked my sleep good sleep may be the biggest thing if you can pull it off go outside at least a few minutes
 thatus after lexapro (nauseated) prozac (still sad) zoloft (god my whole skin is on fire ium in the emergency room and my body is in uncontrollable spasms) and wellbutrin (no sleep for five nights running) uddude0
 wellbutrin does them all except the sleep thing
 adderallwellbutrin klonopin prn (i can literally take a nap on the adderall so it doesnut fuck my sleep too hard) and thereus research to suggest stimulants can be useful for treatment resistant depression
 i have bipolar depression (type ) and i get mixed episodes where i'm manic and depressed i take lamotrigine and wellbutrin and i walk every day i also try to get enough sleep but i don't sleep well so i have to take something for that too
 wellbutrin was like speed for me and i had to take xanax every night to counter it and go to sleep but i lost  pounds in two weeks so also the bonus prize was i looked like shit
 me to me wow youure killing recovery like ur def curednnalso me eats sleep for breakfast stays in room so not tempted by food cries when i donut workout weighs myself  times a day takes extra wellbutrin to curb appetite searches black thinspo on pinterest
 ium on a combo of wellbutrinklonipin as needed and itus worked wonders for me i also use valerian root for sleep aid
 man wellbutrin was a wonder drug for me for everything i mentioned above except in the  months i was on it i got like maybe  really good nightsu sleep and it gave me crazy muscle aches and tightness
 the sleeping is a side effect of lexapro been there they will probably switch your meds or add wellbutrin with lex
 ium going off zoloft soon bc my dr wants me only on wellbutrin amp; sleep meds amp; tbh ium nervous about coming off zoloft withdrawals are fucking brutal
 i found wellbutrin particularly good for increasing my energy and getting rid of anhedonia so i wasnut sleeping  hours a day anymore and could muster up some interest to leave my bedroom it can raise anxiety a bit though so itus not for everyone
 depends on the right balance being numbed out with zoloft the first month was fine bc my mental state was really bad to start with i was able to shut down yet function and catch up on sleep (xanax) wellbutrin was added in to provide balance ive been off them now for a year

 day  of being back on the wellbutrin bus and maybe itus a placebo effect but i already feel like sleeping beauty ni am worried that my prince is going to have some longterm side effects but at least iull be alive to experience them so win? 
 according to my sleep app my sleep ucscoreud is  less than others who use this same app thatus not very motivating info for someone who hates competition i am currently taking a high dose of wellbutrin which has virtually eliminated my need for more than  hrs of sleep
 yup if a therapist ever gives you wellbutrin i would recommend you to see if itus better to take something else ium taking lexapro again which iuve been taking since i was  (my mom and dad had fights every night and i would cry myself to sleep)
 wellbutrin also messed me up bad when my doctor prescribed it for anxiety  i absolutely hated it with my whole being and just wanted to sleep  to keep the uncomfortable physical symptoms at bay i cannot imagine what it would do in someone with bipolar ii
 okay not too bad i got some sleeping medication and wellbutrin
 me haha my wellbutrin isnut giving me any bad side effects ) nnme sleeps  hours a night constant leg bumping nnlmaooo
 ium actually doing my hw and not upset for once so maybe this wellbutrin shit is gonna work even if i only sleep for  hrs bc my brain pounds in my skull
 i was on it while taking the maximum dosage of zoloft wellbutrin gave me vivid dreams that oftentimes ended in me kicking and screaming out of my sleep random muscle spasms and l ringing in my left ear i stopped taking it after the last side effect
 does anyone else that takes cymbalta or wellbutrin sleep for  hours every time they miss it
 an artist i follow on here said she started wellbutrin recently and it changed her sleeping schedule all around but thatus the only side effect iuve heard about it
 i took wellbutrin to quit smoking (it worked) felt very content and happy except for the sleepless nights so cut my dosage in half no other issues however a friend was taking it at the same time and became suicidal (ended up in hospital)
 i took wellbutrin for a few years helped me to quit smoking and supress my appetite but i did have trouble sleeping everyone's chemistry is different though
 my gp told me that wellbutrin can cause anxiety when i asked about anti anxiety meds likely something i'll never get bc they all induce sleepiness uddude
 ium there too i take paxil and wellbutrin for my depression and anxiety but then i also have several other medicationsvitamins for other health stuff going on i think i take a total of  when i wake up and then  when i go to sleep you are not alone
 i take wellbutrin for my depression and it helps in that aspect adderall has significantly increased my already high anxiety and wellbutrin hasnut touched that and it doesnut help that both have made it impossible to get more than  hours of sleep a night because im up all night
 headaches are one of the more common side effects of wellbutrin but the fact that itus mindsplitting is reason enough to consult the doctor plus the sleepiness
 anyone ever get mind splitting headaches with wellbutrin or vyvanse? or get incredibly sleepy with them?
 me can i please get a good night of sleep?nwellbutrin nouufe0f
 iuve been off wellbutrin ever since that first year and have never been on another antidepressant since and rarely lose sleep anymore yet this still happens to me minus the spine tingling
 the first time this ever happened to me was when i was in college and was on wellbutrin for a few months after my mom died because of a school project i lost sleep while on it and suddenly my spine tingled and all the other symptoms i described happened as well
 ium on week  of mg of wellbutrin and one of the side effects can be fatigue  almost fell asleep playing tug of war with my dog maybe i should take these bad boys before bed
 i pray this woman prescribes me some adderall i am strugglin and this wellbutrin aint doing shit and i'm actually sleepin so i havent needed the trazodone or hydroxyzine but something has to give cause my attention span is  seconds long and it feels like i'm losing days
 i love wellbutrin bc i am not depressed at all now but also i hate it bc i donut sleep and the only thing i ever want to eat is butter toast
 i'm hesitant to experiment too much i'm taking wellbutrin and seroquel but the latter is for sleep
 tbh i feel pretty out of it today i accidentally took wellbutrin last night when i was supposed to take spiro and did not sleep well at all
 i first tried therapy  years ago still go have taken paxil serzone concerta adderall wellbutrin carbatrol vyvanse nothing lamictal xanax hydroxyzine tramadol and now zoloft i work constantly on mood regulation sleep  whole grains  caring relationships gt;gt;gt;
 i love dating other mentally ill trans people ium out of wellbutrin? they gave me a weeks worth they canut sleep? have a trazadone nnthis is all theoretical of course i would never share prescription drugs uddudc
 i tries wellbutrin and ritalin hated it finally in july was given adderal it works but then sleep is non existent lol
 i take seroquel for sleep too its a love hate thing ive taken wellbutrin  was almost as bad as effexor for me
 i have some curated neurodivergent advice re nonsleepaid scrips that helped me sleep when i was on adderall and wellbutrin but donut want to offer if unsolicitednnat any rate i hope you get some good sleep soon i know that shit leaves me wacky
 my wellbutrin doubled and my body is thanking me by giving me  hours of sleep
 so far wellbutrin has been great aside from the fact that i literally canut sleep at night despite taking my meds at am how the fuck does this shit linger all damn day
 august th was the last day i took my meds before restarting wellbutrin and trintellix for depression and anxiety naltrexone for binge control it took so much effort to try to take them on a schedule and i was sleeping so much i couldnut stick to it
 theyull most likely start you off with nonstimulant medications i started off with wellbutrin and currently taking strattera i personally havenut had trouble sleeping but itus different for everyone you just gotta play around with different dosagesmedications if necessary
 medical appointment with surprise thyroid blood draw almost no sleep due to crankyreactive sciatic nervehamstring (twitchy mofo argh) good news going on wellbutrin to try it out tiny dose to start off definitely avoiding ssris from here on nmay actually get a nap wiped
 wellbutrin made me super sleep ium on a prozac generic now and it works really well for my anxiety
 wellbutrin caused manic episodes with me and increased my anxiety terribly sleeplessness too loss of appetite increased sex drive a low dose mood stabilizer instead of ssri was my right fit
 wellbutrin was great i was on it for a few years but it seemed like it was making my memory worse after a while so i had to stop switched to remeron mostly used it to get and stay asleep which was more helpful than anything an antidepressant could otherwise do
 hi katy at some point in my life i have taken either wellbutrin lexapro paxil trazadone buspar xanax and diazepam either for depression or anxiety (most sleep related anxiety) long story short i have had the most success in the last few months with topical essential
 wellbutrin drove me madcouldn't sleep
 lexapro disrupted my sleep a lot and gave me super weird dreams but wellbutrin has been great the dizziness is definitely present but is only occasional after the first month or so
 itus been a uclose majorly track of timeud week due to weird sleep and constantly taste testing edibles but guanfacine i have noticed a difference amp; they started me out on  mg on tues or weds the fatigue is there but itus not bad ium on wellbutrin amp; lamictal as well though
 did our psych stufffff todaynnwe're gonna stick with the fluoxetine and wellbutrinntapering off to basically halfquarter of a day here and therenwe're also gonna reintroduce the tradzedone but in tiny doses to help bring back a regular sleep schedulennall in all pretty good
 i told my psych about my terrible sleep and sheus like uchave you ever thought about increasing your wellbutrin or adding a xanax?ud and ium likeisnut it your job to think about that? also yes
 i had vivid color musical dreams in which i sang loudly while sleeping  when i did sleep otherwise i was manic about cleaning every surface in the house when i was on zyban to quit smoking that was  years ago haven't had a smoke since you can do this
 i forgot to take my wellbutrin till just now ugh i'm gonna have a hard time falling asleep tonight aren't i
 i feel like wellbutrin makes me astral travel when ium asleep or something because my dreams have been so remote viewing type vibes
 headache not sure ifn) hungover  only had one beer last nightn) periodn) stress  test this weekendn) had alcohol four days this past week as a wellbutrin usernni want to sleep
 ive never had trouble sleeping while on cymbalta until this psychiatrist decided to double my wellbutrin dose overnight kmft and i dont have any  leftover psychiatrists keep fucking up my brain when i need to study and then i cant do shit about it
 me ucok brain i want sleepudnnwellbutrin ucium sorry that option is not available right now would you like uhave dancing queen by abba stuck in your head on repeat at  amu instead?ud
 i just started strattera with a wellbutrin chaser now ium unmotivated and sleepy while my body gets used to it udeudd
 im on wellbutrin and adderall now i never sleep my only path to salvation is ibuprofen pm
 plus prozac can make anxiety worse too and has other side effects like sexual dysfunction sleep problems weight gain hot flashes etc which donut come with wellbutrin
 not me taking my wellbutrin at pm and then wondering why i canut sleep
 is anyone else so excited about bidenus cabinet picks just assuming they are all good decent amp; qualified  what will i do going off of wellbutrin amp; sleeping again?  nnbidenharristransition nbidenharristosaveamerica
 sorry  lexapro may have helped a bit with general mood less depressionnremeron can definitely help with sleep wellbutrin i'm staying with cuz it has a stimulant component and i think that helps push through depression
 want some wellbutrin hahahhaha lololololudeuddudeudduddude0uddude0 dw you just wont eat or sleep or be able to stand upuddude0uddude0uddude0 but it totally works baeuddude0duddude0duddude0d
 iud beat you to the punch jan i had to take antidepressants starting about a month ago ium taking wellbutrin  i also developed high blood pressure i can sleep at night thatus the big thing and ium celebrating right now
 trying to sleep first day on wellbutrin and modafinl i don't think my ambien will help lol tomorrow is going to be interesting can't wait to stream and hopefully make some new friends to play with roadtoaffiliate
 a new much higher dose of wellbutrin plus shit sleep plus one () beer has my body like udeuddudeuddudeuddnnitus like wtf boop are we jacked up or crashing???
 wellbutrin at am then go back to sleep until 
 first coffee in months a mix of that plus h of sleep and wellbutrin feels like i'm crossfaded 
 for me a combination of pristiq wellbutrin and daily dabs of mmj extract has gotten me to the point where i feel awake when i wake up (instead of like i need to sleep another  hours even if that's what i just did uddude0 )
 definitely not nothing i was on wellbutrin for a minute supposed to give you energy but it made me sleepy brains are weird
 yeah ium treatment resistant thatus why ium on so much crap ium on the gabapentin clonazepam and seroquel at the lowest doses for sleep trileptal and lamictal work in tandem wellbutrin is a great antidepressant but doesnut help ocd
 ium horny ium anxious i cant cum and i want to sleep or die thanks wellbutrin udcudf0
 i started taking wellbutrin and it turns out the missing ingredient to giving me the energy to stay awake do normal activities and not sleepbe depressed all the time  was amphetamines
 day  of stay at home quarantine iud like to thank prozac wellbutrin my husband dogs sleep doc amp; you for helping me keep my shit together 
 wellbutrin is the best antidepressant out there i never sleep anymore  sleeps unnecessary anyways
 i second the medchecking ever since starting wellbutrin i noticed that those random twitches you get right before falling asleep are way more dramatic
 sleeping on my girl wellbutrin 
 my biggest concern is increased anxiety and or insomnia from the convo since marijuana can increase heart rate and wellbutrin can also be used to treat concentration and may make sleep more difficult
 if wellbutrin doesn't give me a push i am in big trouble nnbest case scenario i sleep myself to death because i've just no energy left
 hypomanic yea i don't rly get full mania but i def noticed i've been hypomanic for at least a week like since election news i've hardly been able to eat or sleep on time i feel like i'm on wellbutrin again lol
 i took zoloft and i was one of the rare few with side effects my libido was fine but i was manic  sleeping was almost impossible i took wellbutrin after that actually raised my libido but i ended up with hand tremors and eventually it stopped workingudeudduduufe0f
 yea it made me a bit too hyped and anxious so basically no stims for this sleepy bish but if u can hack wellbutrin which is a bit more stimulating probs way more a chance you will be fine with the vyvanse? idk either way i hope it helps u wit da focus uddudefudcudffcuddudefuddudefuddudef
 i'm sorry i've been on so many different antidepressants these last few years it's disheartening wellbutrin worked the best and longest but now i can take  mg and sleep for  hours straight ridiculous
 i also take wellbutrin though amp; apparently thatus supposed to make you wired amp; i take that before bed bc it also makes me sleepy i guess itus bc my brain makes absolutely zero dopamine
 love this feel you on the meds u i take zoloft wellbutrin and klonopin on top of my ms medschronic fatigue i just want to sleep all the time ((hugs)) i hope you feel better i love the beautiful glitter u
 why is it that after i wake up and take my morning meds which includes adderall and wellbutrin i am still tired enough to fall back to sleep?
 wellbutrin was great until i couldnut sleep on it now ium on latuda which helps me sleep
 doing this new thing where i only sleep from am to am and then for breakfast and lunch i have  (one) iced vanilla latte and mg of wellbutrin and shockingly i do not feel very good
 i recently started taking wellbutrin and the crashes are udeuddfudeuddfnni was literally falling asleep at the dinner table today uddudedudduded
 doc insists i keep trying wellbutrin and adds some kind of pill to help me sleep not a sleep aid (at my request not really interested in meeting the ambien walrus)nnthe idea is better sleep  better daysnnlet's see how this goes
 side affects of wellbutrin i am not enjoying n my clammy hands when i get anxious n my anxiety is worse n ium  sweating even if im cold nnbut now i donut sleep for  hours because ium depresseduddude0e so swag
 be sleep deprived thanks to wellbutrin lt;
 that's how wellbutrin felt for me i hope it works out just keep an eye on your sleeping some people do great
 itus interesting how these drugs have different effects on different people sertraline makes me very sleepy wellbutrin makes me anxious but if i miss a day of it my obsessive behaviors start actin up lol
 one time for awhile i was on wellbutrin zoloft and risperidone and all i ever did was sleep and sometimes i miss just being asleep all the time nnwhen i was awake i was anxious and sad but thats not the point
 i was on latuda and wellbutrindoc told me to stop taking latuda and upped wellbutrin dosage also told me to stop taking sleeping pills
 zoloft and wellbutrin with trazadone for sleep is my sweet spot for now anyway
 i was on antidepressants amp; had medication to sleep (which gave me like four hours a night) amp; then iud have to take wellbutrin in the morning to get myself to function quit everything cold turkey about a year ago and ium glad ium off it but i canut sleep again lol
 wellbutrin made me psycho and sleepy but ium bipolar so thatus prob why
 switched from celexa to wellbutrin and i love it it doesnut mess with my sleep and also helps curb nicotine cravings
 loveee wellbutrin dreams canut wait to sleep every night in hopes of having an interesting dream
 girl that's the same med that was in zyban it's prosac you were probably sick after you took it benzos are proper good for sleeping
 zyban effectsfor me anywaysnnsleeplessnessnminor sore throatnsome nauseanmind wanderingna bit of dizzinessnnsounds crazy but all those things make me not want to smoke even my  intake has been reduced
 the day before zyban was my last good night of sleep
 lithium wellbutrin caplyta topamax and restoril for sleep for the most part they do their job ium always mixing the potions though
 so i started wellbutrin a week ago and ium currently experiencing shaky hands and trouble sleeping and kind of a bad taste in my mouth?? i hope these go away bc i really think wellbutrin will help me
 i'm a poet i'm on two wellbutrin and busparni also take vitamin d because i'm deficient i take melatonin when i can't sleep and because i live in the great state of oregon i supplement this on occasion with weed
 i'm taking wellbutrin so i don't even know if i'm allowed more? but it's something to discuss nnon occasion being able to meet deadlines is worth having to sleep for two straight days after
 trying to find out if anyone who had the covid vaccine had weird sleep issues i experienced the weirdest brain fogfeeling last night kinda like when i took my wellbutrin at night and kept mixing up dreams and reality bc it messed with me
 wellbutrin keeps cucking me from a full nights sleep uddude i went to bed  hrs ago wtf
 me googles reasons for my erratic and intense heart ratennright i have this thing called 'ventricular tachycardia' and it sounds dangerous goodbye everyonennalso me drinks  coffees takes wellbutrin sleeps less than  hours a night is burning through savings
 canut sleep sponsored by clenpiq colonoscopy prep solution
 i assume this person said wellbutrin helps with the loss of sex drive and they are right  ium on wellbutrin and lexapro so you can be on bothalso it really helped that all ssris made me extremely tired and oversleep on their own
 my fav part of wellbutrin is how i am ripped out of my sleep by anxiety i wasnut even conscious for at exactly am every day
 i am currently on mg of vyvanse and it is working way better for me than adderall however i weirdly get sleepy on my meds a lot i take wellbutrin lexapro and the vyvanse if you experience depression symptomslethargy wellbutrin has been a good stimulant for me and my pals
 can't take my stronger nausea meds anymore now that i'm on wellbutrin the stronger ones just made me sleep all day but sometimes that's better than being in pain all day really hoping today turns around uufe0f
 i was supposed to sleep but i may down  cups of coffee n my wellbutrin n try my damnedest to not ruin my mom's birthday by being a fucking mess
 wellbutrin messed with my sleep one of the reasons iull be trying new meds soon
 the point that i had to lessen my wellbutrin to mg because mg during the fall is team no sleep
 yeah it was a little speedy for me too i donut need much sleep in general never have ium set with  hours a nite but on wellbutrin i was regularly sleeping for like  hours and i was fully functional bizarre shit
 ium currently on wellbutrin sertraline lamotrigine gabapentin vyvanse and trazodone for sleepu sometimes you need a cocktail and even then itus not enough lmao i see my psych on monday to change them up again
 wellbutrin got me back on my high school sleep schedule accepting applications for new online australian friends
 i'm on wellbutrin with a side of lamictal the wellbutrin has definitely helped with my energy level i was sleeping hrs a day and still tired before
 yeah i got prescribed abilify to balance out my wellbutrin dosage increase to the maximum a few years ago honestly didn't notice much from them other than sleepiness so i stopped taking them
 i needed medication to be frank avoiding medication almost killed me for me the key was figuring out that my serotonin was fine but my dopamine was wrecked wellbutrin saved me i was sleeping  hours per day and still exhausted amp; hopeless nothing but wellbutrin helped
 dreaming is better unless you are on meds like wellbutrin even then better to try to sleep if you can uuu
 i donut meal prep but i do put my vibrator and wellbutrin on the bed next to me when i fall asleep to have when i wake up so i get the overall concept
 i am absolutely the only fool who will take wellbutrin before bed i be so tired that iull fall asleep but the dreams are actually insane and i wake up violently energized 
 donut abuse wellbutrin of lamictal or lithium really itull shut down your kidneys but seroquel if you stay up past the sleepy part might make you feel funny? i used to take it i donut remember
 i really needed the chemical help nso whether you and your pcp go with wellbutrin or another medication it is definitely worthwhile nnot an md so canut speak to the seizure aspect it took some time to get used to the medication trouble sleeping for a bit but not anymore
 thatus what i think wellbutrin  electrolyte craziness from ed  a bad night sleep i like the description of it as a cascade
 cymbalta amp; wellbutrin for me plus seroquel for sleep finally a combo that helps without gnarly side effects only took  years
 also i think my meds have stopped working amp; i'm back to manic mood swings amp; trouble sleeping who knew my body would somehow build tolerance to my meds in less than two weeks especially to the same med (wellbutrin) that actually at least changed my mood somewhat by the nd week
 fell asleep for a bit earlier bc of a blazing headache uddude i've been getting them from my neck but i wonder if the wellbutrin is possibly adding to it since my body is still getting acclimated it didn't happen before when i was on it but idk anyway i've had more energy since
 i've hit my sleep goal for  nights in a row and i'm sure my watch is convinced someone is impersonating me it's wellbutrin probably
 girl i have the lowest tolerance wellbutrin made me so sick i lost lbs lacmital dropped my bp so low i couldn't stand without fainting the only thing that doesn't work is my fucking sleeping pills
 i actually just started wellbutrin about  days ago (my first antidepressants) and i cannot fucking sleepudeudd please tell me this goes away itus the only side effect i get and it really affects me
 also i'm not a doctor so i can't point out u clearly have sleep apnea i can't suggest u go to a walkin and have them prescribe an appointment at a sleep clinic once that's done i won't be able to suggest a cpap modafinil and maybe some wellbutrin because i'm not a doctor
 made the mistake of taking my wellbutrin at am and then attempting to take a nap the nightmares were so vivid ium still uneasy udeudd and i got sleep paralysis udeudd
 dammit this wellbutrin is really fucking up my sleep schedule
 also keep note kids  redbulls  mg vyvanse  mg wellbutrin  sleep deprivation  anxiety issues is not a good combination
 wellbutrin (depression) methylphenidate (adhd) buspirone (anxiety) and trazadone (for sleep)
 wellbutrin plus melatonin hangover is like being awake but asleep at the same time
 i'm caught in a cycle of staying up late waking up late taking my wellbutrin late and being unable to fall asleep early bc of my late wellbutrin
 wellbutrin is making it so hard for me to fall asleep uddudeuddudeuddude
 let's start with wellbutrin some people experience some agitation or trouble sleeping so take mg in the morning and again midday if you're a nicotine user you might experience a side effect of feeling some nausea while attempting to vape or smoke while using it
 oops  and the first few weeks of using wellbutrin i couldnut stop shaking and i was light headed and couldnut sleep sooooouddudcuddudcuddudcuddudcuddudcuddudcuddudcuddudcuddudcuddudcidk itus rough i am terrified to have the anxiety i had before zoloft tho so idk what to do
 vicious cocktail of celexa wellbutrin and abilify topped off with trazedone bc i couldn't sleep with all that shit in my system 0 do not recommend it was basically just like being very depressed but faster
 what do you do for work? i went from a few hours a day to  recently due to the holidays amp; more clients that plus my dr putting me on wellbutrin means i've gotten little sleep in weeks uddudec
 medicine (specifically i took wellbutrin) sleep any assistance you can get food  minutes of time to myself without hearing an upset baby music on  sing w music
 i said i kind of wonder if my anxiety would lessen a bit if i got actual good sleep so i could go down on wellbutrin but idk we will see i also think more than one night in a row of actual sleep vs an m kicking me or scratching me with her toenails would help lol
 i didnut so they didnut put me on any meds and said the seizure was bc of a combo of stress sleep deprivation and being on the anti anxiety med wellbutrin which makes people more susceptible to seizures 
 i do that entirely too often i used to think oh i'll just skip it then because if i dont i wont be able to sleep well and i'll feel weirdnnnowadays i just grit my teeth and take that wellbutrin even if its pm when i notice
 i should've went back to sleep after i took the wellbutrin its sitting in my stomach hard af
 i felt the same way then i talked with the doc and was diagnosed with depression never crossed my mind that i could be depressed got some wellbutrin started with a therapist and boy do i feel and sleep better good luck and stay funny
 my doc told me wellbutrin has no anti sleep issues i take a dose in the morning and one before bed no probs if you can get your doc to prescribe progesterone that causes sleepy
 i don't know how you can sleep after i take my wellbutrin its like i did coke and i'm wired
 iuve napped three days in a row thanks to wellbutrin it also gives me nightmares every time ium asleep nnalso my head hurts and i get dizzy when i stand up ium not taking thing shit lol
 i like taking cbd and delta  as mood stabilizers ium trying to get off of having to take wellbutrin to treat my depression also i hate taking pills my doctor tried to kill me by prescribing to me zoloft mg sleeping pills amp; wellbutrin not taking none of that
 ium doing this too uddudcnndepressionnanxietynadhdnptsdnni take wellbutrin and adderall i donut go to therapy though i should ptsd is from the time my roommate had a psychotic break took acid and kept me up for  days ium triggered if i feel like my sleepus threatened at alluddudcd 
 i quit smoking before i took wellbutrin i never got cravings when i quit (some folks donut) when i stopped wellbutrin i craved cigarettes for the first time ever i was like ucomg thatus what it feels likeudnnalso it exacerbated my insomnia and i didnut sleep for days uddude
 started this morning off by not sleeping at all (again) taking my wellbutrin (which is orange and i donut like that) and listening to clairo (because i decided lorde woulduve ruined my day and immunity was my plan b)
 i take wellbutrin at  pm and b like why canut i sleep
 i was prescribed wellbutrin and my doctor said you may have trouble sleeping and i'm like lady you underestimate my ability to fall asleep anywhere in the daytime i've taken caffeine pills with energy drinks and fallen asleep an hour later udduded
  mg of wellbutrin and  mg of adderall my psychiatrist said ucmmmm she doesnut need sleepudeuddud
 just some side effects i experienced risperdal  pituitary tumorpresented as cushings; wellbutrin   seizures ; lithium  sleepwalking suicidal ideation thrill seeking behavior
 i was also crosstapering from celexa so my dizziness could have been the interaction between the two overall i like wellbutrin better celexa made me sleep all the time
 the olu waking up in the am hour completely unable to go back to sleep because there are so many things to worry about dear wellbutrin itus only been two weeks but pick up the pace udeudd
 hang on i'm  months on depression is better anxiety is lifting but im fatigued constantly the common options are to up dose or add wellbutrin to combat the sleepiness
 i take coffeewellbutrinvyvanse and then wonder why i canut eat or sleep ever
 so anyway ium on like the lowest clinical dose of prozac and wellbutrin rn which sounds like a bad idea considering sad but like i guess in her mind itus better i get a full nights sleep
 i was  when i started wellbutrin and i used to sleep am to pm every single day without fail
 dang ium so sorry my psychiatrist just bumped my wellbutrin up amp; put me back on sleeping pills so ium not sure what else can be done especially if itus borderline ptsd like you said
 my favorite thing about wellbutrin is it doesnut let me go back to sleep after i wake up so i guess ium doing the dishes now
 i switched to wellbutrin which isnut an ssri but an ndri (norepinephrinedopamine reputake inhibitor) it made me feel like i had motivation again and i could actually fall asleep while helping with my depression symptoms
 ucbrittney why donut you try other antidepressantsud because the first time i started wellbutrin i couldnut sleep or eat for like  weeks ium not risking that experience again trying other meds
 okay adhd actuallyautistic neurodiversesquad friends a couple months ago i switched from wellbutrin to strattera for my adhd and since iuve been falling asleep even more often ium going to finally try adderall at age  any words of advice? warnings? helpful hints?
 mf i was sleepy all day bc i forgot to take my wellbutrin
 i just took a zyrtec or a xanax grabbed it in the dark either way i'm in for some interesting secondsleep early am dreams uddudeudcudf00
 damn it zyrtec y u taking so long to kick in? i wanna go back to sleep now
 if you feel like it you can try the otc meds that are less sleepinducing like generics for allegra zyrtec )
 zyrtec fluids and sleep and you'll be ight
 dear zyrtec do your job i want sleepuddude
 i've been taking zyrtec amp; sudafed for about  weeks now i'm a lot less stuffysnotty but now all i do is sleep amp; cough
 yes zyrteci need to look it up to see if that's the same stuff i'd rather take less sleeping pills 
 day  and i still haven't made time to replace my zyrtec npunishment is no sleep ringing ears and scratchy throatni am not always smart
 took a damn zyrtec hopefully i don't fall asleep at the funeral
 if you need a good nights sleep take a zyrtec lights out within  mins
 take a benadryl if you can sleep zyrtec zantac but i forgot your dad is a doctor will u be at the saturday?
 teaminsomnia guess i shouldn't of taken that zyrtec before bed smdh uddude eyeswideopen ishouldbesleep
 but really zyrtec doesn't make you sleepy
 been doing the flonase and zyrtec my immediate solution is going to be to not sleep here anymore bedroom is all moldy
 i got bad sinuses and having trouble sleeping at night amp; this asshole doctor literally just told me to buy some zyrtec d and nasal spray
 discovered that zyrtec have a nasal spray this is the best i've breathed in months i'm going to sleep well tonight
 i really have a problem with going to sleep when i don't take no benadryl or a zyrtec
 hopefully this zyrtec and nyquil help me sleep
 take a zyrtec and drink a glass of milk you'll fall asleep in no time
 i took  zyrtec's hrs apart amp; let go of reality lol i'm probably about to go back to sleep
 went to sleep at  cough syrup amp; zyrtec
 so i really awoke from my sleep to pop a damn zyrtec this shit better start workin within the next hour uddude
 you just don't know how hard i'm trying to make it to midnight i'm so close to fixing this sleepytime tea amp; taking this zyrtec
 zyrtec i took making me sleepy uddude
 so now that i know zyrtec isn't non drowsy what should i take tomorrow? as of right now i'm sleepy and still sneezing
 i was kinda thinking zyrtec wouldn't make me sleepyi awoke from a comanap that i didn't plan  haha
 leg is so itchygotta take a zyrtec but concerned will fall asleep uddude dr tomorrow
 i got rid of alcohol and the rest of those foods  but i still have a diet coke  because the zyrtec makes me sleepy
 went trachea infection  bronchial infection  now i sleep through the night without coughing because of lansoprazole and zyrtec
 zyrtec makes me sleepy so i'll give allegra a try thx does it keep you awake?
 found zyrtec took it gonna try sleep
 next time you go to the store buy zyrtec and zantac same effect as benadryl without the sleepiness

 i took zyrtec and was able to fall asleep around

 hydrocortisone is an antiinflammatory but it can only treat the symptoms if you're having an allergic reaction you'd wanna take antihistamines like said in that instance benadryl is a good one if you don't mind sleepiness xyzal is a good option for nondrowsy
 three years sleep man ngone nmamohhimeshi nfusinsha nasphalt nkc nxyzal 
 why is zyrtec twenty dollars i just want to stop itching and not fall asleep
 zyrtec or benadryl benadryl works the fastest but makes you sleepy and zyrtec works well for taking everyday and claritin i find good for congestion and stuffy nose
  'one a day' zyrtec will hopefully stop the itching enough that i can sleep
 took me longer than i care to admit to stop asking wtf did flake say about obama? but i'm sleep deprived and high on zyrtec (yay allergy season) no clue what the mango mussolini was on
 i go for allegrad zyrtec makes me sleepy
 took zyrtec again last night after a very long time for my rhinitis and i slept the entire day today ive forgotten how strong this medication is and now i bet i wonut be getting any sleep tonight uddude
 lately i've been getting too much sleep so apparently i'm up in pain throat worse then ever hopefully this zyrtec and sinus pills do the job for me 
 for me it not only makes me sleepy but also very very depressed  lexapro also effects that receptor and i had a nasty reaction to that as well of course everyone is different but i'm saying odds are if benadryl makes you sleepy zyrtec will bc they're hitting the same spot
 i'm just saying i've done the research  the h histamine receptor  it's why benadryl zyrtec seroquel and trazodone make people sleepy
 that's bc benadryl and zyrtec work on the same histamine receptor and it's what makes you sleepy  zyrtec is an older generation antihistamine nondrowsy most likely means it has sudafed give allegra a go?
 zyrtec works on the same histamine receptor that benadryl does  the h receptor  it's what makes you sleepy try allegra  that's the only one i've had a bit of luck with
 i've found that (offbrand) zyrtec works for me but my allergies are more often skinrash related it doesn't put me to sleep though most of the other ones i've tried don't work on me(except corticosteroids but can't take those long term or wout a prescription)
 so if you guys wanna buy flu pills get nd gen antihistamines like clarinase zyrtec and aerius to name a few wont make you sleepy fosho

 zyrtec makes me sleepynot able to think and gives me terrible psychological side effects (change in personality for the worse)

 my hubs is an eye doc  he said itus prob related to stress too much caffeine lack of sleep or allergies lifestyle change is the best for lid twitch lol prob not what you wanted to hear zyrtec can help regardless of cause
 zyrtec girl it only makes you sleep hard the first few days from what i remember i use to take it before school everyday uddudcdudcudffb
 i am that small percentage of zyrtec users who gets drowsy itus because the second generation antihistamines do not cross the blood brain barrier and make you sleepy but guess what it passes my blood brain barrier and makes me drowsy af and i still didnt reach  count wtf end
 zyrtec your my only hope nownnpray my allergies don't ruin my sleep this time
 anyone else experience extreme fatigue from daily zyrtec? been sleeping up to hrs and that's my only recent change i need my life back

 when you take xyzal at night you can sleep relieved from allergy symptoms and wake up for a full day in a winter funderland ufufe0fuufe0f

 take some allergy meds if you have any a long term pill like zyrtec or allegra will help somewhat but if it gets too itchy benadryl is great but sleep inducing
 benadryl zyrtec (and now flonase) but it was likeim taking something everyday cuz my sinuses either don't drain (or clog when i sleep) or they drain so good i get sore throat and swollen stuff from post nasal drip orz

 yeah that yellow pill make u sleepy so it's good i can't take that pill only zyrtec n clarines
 i usually take zyrtec too but i went to take the sleepy yellow pill instead and it's not working ((
 i don't know why i thought zyrtec would not make me sleepy just read the label 'drowsiness may occur' no wonder i'm practically falling asleep at my work desk ugh sendtoothpicks
 just ask the people working at the apotek (drugstore) and tell them you need something for allergies that's not zyrtecnnfor sleeping i'm not so sure most of the real effective ones need prescription (why many stock up on melatonin when they go to the us)
 zyrtec definitely doesn't work as well against short term allergy relief (and doesn't work for me anymore) zyrtec however won't make you tired but i use benadryl for night time allergies  sleep
 i've never needed benadryl but someone asking for that in norway on reddit provided these answersnif you need it against allergies i would recommend zyrtec against travel sickness marzine as a sleeping aid postafennnprobably similar brands in sweden
 ya give allegra a try itus suppose to be stronger than the claritin you can try zyrtec also but sometimes people get a little sleepy off that one too
 same sus i hope that zyrtec work i need sleep
 zyrtec is a major unintentional sleep aid for me it works great during allergyseason but if i'm tired and i take one pill  it's lights out for me for several hours

 lucky on the allergy issuemy poor daughter sleeps with a diffuser and takes zyrtec daily and is constantly a messwe take the good w the bad
 lexapro made me suicidal and exhausted it works on the same histamine receptor in the brain that benadryl does  itus why benadryl makes some people sleepy zyrtec also works on that receptor i canut take any of those meds  they all throw me into an exhausted depression
 today was a wash due to that sleep attack guess it's back to loratadine after all to see if zyrtec really is the culprit
 ugh i got another sleep attack maybe the zyrtec is making me drowsy after all

 i've tried claritin amp; zyrtec only gives me mild relief sudafed works well for me and benadryl but can't afford the sleep time tho
 seems about the only thing zyrtec is good for is sleep; they need to remarket as a sleepaid it cause it doesn't help with any allergy symptoms
 yeah benadryl does that to me too never took zyrtec before i usually wake up with plenty of energy but seriously could sleep all day right now no other symptoms of being sick or anything uddude

 my partner takes zyrtec to combat terrible cat allergies (i came with two) and constantly has to fight through the sleepiness i donut envy him so odd your doctor wouldnut warn you upfront
 i used to take zyrtec literally for years until it started to change my sleeping pattern
 anybody else get super sleepy even several hours after taking zyrtec?
 but obvi itus inconvenient for a lot of people so to treat symptoms youull use allegra (wonut cause sleepiness) zyrtec (can make you sleepy) claritin (can make you sleepy at high doses) are used but they donut treat congestion
 i donut know what happened while i was asleep but i woke up in desperate need of a zyrtec make it make sense

 uddude0 the only side effect of the normal zyrtec (without the d) is extreme sleepiness because of the antihistamine you can also feel a bit fatigue dizziness and dry mouth if you need more medication for allergies iud try flonase with the normal dose of zyrtec
 allergies are kicking my butt this spring and claritin is doing nothing really hoping zyrtec i just bought works and i won't have to resort to benadryl or i'm going to spend entire day asleep on my feet
 allegragt;gt;zyrtecbenadryl mainly because less sleepiness cheaper amazon or price club versions get the d version from pharmacy as a second step but a pain in the butt last step add singular need a prescriptions donut have rugs and vacuum a lot with a dyson
 iuve been sleep since like  fuckin with that zyrtec udeuddudcudffduduufe0f
 i take zyrtec and my eyes are never itchy i'm dependent on it now though and if i stop taking it my legs become so itchy i bruise myself in my sleep from scratching i only did that twice and then resigned myself to taking it every single day forever
  hours laterstatus post  topical hydrocortisone applications and  zyrtec and i didn't think my allergies were that bad benadrylmakesmesleepy butiamstillitchy allergyawareness 
 yep i take flonase and zyrtec daily and they do nothing in the spring and i usually get a cold when my allergies are this bad and ium not sleeping well oh well
 all i need to one big ass zyrtec so i can sleep for hr and knock this sinus pressure out my nose
 zyrtec benadryl lortab etodolac flexeril celexa trazodone temazepam motrin amp; aspirin i will either sleep or die at this point idc
 i wish i could sleep with my windows open but i tried that yesterday and i needed a dayquil on top of a zyrtec to feel normal
 went to target and got her some zyrtec she sleep now hopefully they will work
 sometimes it just happens nni use the brand name zyrtec and it gets rid of it for  hours pretty solidly without making me sleepier than watching an hbox winners finals set
 sheeesh zyrtec is a good allergy med to use that wonut put you to sleep otherwise benadryl is the go to for me anyway
 my allergies make me sooo sleepy even while using zyrtec
 get some zyrtec or aleve they don't make you sleepy even my little dog has runny eyes and do i it's the trees
 ium bout to take this zyrtec amp; go back to sleep i feel bad uddudeudeudd
 zyrtec is the best and you wonut be sleepy from it
 for  years i've been telling my mom to get me zyrtec it's worked in the past i always got no kaya you're ammune to it so i got these bitch ass off brand shit and left me looking like i smoked  j's in my sleep and haven't blown my nose in ages
 true pain is being at the threshold of sneezing but never sneezing twice in a row while holding in a gallon of snot cause you forgot allergy meds all during a test you didn't study for on  hours of sleep and crashing off of  shots of espressonnalso does anyone have zyrtec 
 take like  zyrtec before you go to sleep
 ok i need allergy meds recommendations  i'm sneezing have a scratchy throat and i cough all day and night so i'm not sleeping either zyrtec isn't working what do i need to take?  over it
 (i hear there's a lot of difference between the different allergy pills i got my mom on zyrtec too bc claritin also makes her sleepy)
 its ami woke up to coughing and mommy i can't sleepcan i sleep on you? vapor rub zyrtecu 
  hrs no sleep zyrtec  melatonin and am still up after only  hrs smh i need help nightshift

 zyrtec d is the magic cure this year that and sleeping in this weekend and laying low hope you feel better soon
 zyrtec got me sleepy af mannnnn
 i can't sleep i'm so excited to take my zyrtec tomorrow morning ) ) )
 itus supposed to have fewer side effects zyrtec puts me to sleep xyzal doesnut
 zyrtec and claritin say they're nondrowsy but they work better than lunesta for sleep for me
 will do ium trying really hard to stay up a little but i took a zyrtec for my allergies and ium starting to feel a little sleepy uddude
 i just had a jumbo sized coffee to take the edge off my hunger a couple arthritis pain pills so i donut lock up during the night a sudafed so i can breath a zyrtec for my allergies and a double dose of ambien with a xanax chaser to hopefully get some sleep ium a fucking mess
 zyrtec puts me to sleep but itus great for allergies  allegra is best for me
 i probably need to grab a zyrtec and my teddy bear and try to head back to sleep
 what do you take?ni normally use zyrtec doesnut relieve all symptoms but never makes me drowsy but i also use nasal spray and a humidifier when i sleep helps tremendouslyntake this from someone allergic to dogs who just got a dog uddudeni finally feel normal again lol
 how special am i if i am in that  population of people who get sleepy after taking zyrtec? pretty special right??
 this getting no sleep shit is not cool i hope this zyrtec fixes this little boy problem tonight lol
 i think it is allergies i have zyrtec in my bag so i should be good i got sleep last night
 i'm allergic as well i can only tell if i touch my face after petting them or they sleep on my pillow otherwise i'm good i take a combo of zyrtec and singulair seems to work cf sinuses are a bastard anyway so some of your issues could be that more than the cats
 zyrtec d hr might be prescription depending on which state youure in only use nasal sprays for short periods body gets addicted to it and can have withdrawal otherwise good sleep and diethydration
 i thought zyrtec made you sleepy taking its sweet damn time nnwhen i wake up i will find out if bambam is coming or going uddude
 my husband and my dog are both suffering from spring allergies there was only one zyrtec left i gave it to the dog while my husband was sleeping

 does zyrtec make anyone else sleepy? good lord i took one for my allergies and i can barely keep my eyes open
 dude benadryl doesnut even work it just makes you go to sleep so you donut feel the allergies i took it the other day because i ran out of my zyrtec but i had to stay awake for work and i was still sneezing like a mad man with itchy eyes and a runny nose
 allergy season got me so blah zyrtec sleepy
 like iuve been taking  zyrtec because my allergies are so bad and theyuve slacked off but the minute i stop here they come again it wouldnut be so bad if they didnut make me so sleepy i struggle enough at work and now this? i canut win uddude
 i didnt take zyrtec today and now my eyes are itchy and my nose is running and i cant really breathe well and im trying to sleep
 take the benedryl and sleep early take the zyrtec in the am
 zyrtec x a day once in the am amp; once in pm then get that vickus vapor rub and put it on when you go to sleepdrink that oj and do some cardio to clear ya sinuses
 first of all i have never tried benadryl and zyrtec together but i would imagine if you add lean in the mix it'll be the best vivid dream sleep everr  that's all
 only  hours of sleep i keep waking up ium seriously considering taking this zyrtec but i might not make it to work lol
 thank you for caring because ium outta control with benadryl but luckily zyrtec works just as good and doesnut make me fall asleep lol i think itus time i make the transition
 popped  zyrtec tabs before going to bed last night because my sinuses were killing mesleep slows your metabolism so they're only kicking in this morning when i'm at work dumbass selfmedicate slapyou
 hoping a certain baby is doped up enough to sleep tonight sheus got zyrtec and ibuprofen on board and we bathed her in oatmeal bubble bath and slathered her in cortisone triple paste and vanicream

 girl i was dying i got zyrtecd generic brand behind the counter amp; ium good i took it before i went to sleep amp; when i woke up
 good morning it seems that a drug store near a certain persons house says that this person buy numerous boxes of xyzal allergy meds hence the twitter name ahhh sleeping problem huh ? 
 also i think i know why i had that fucked up dream last night when i got home from work yesterday i took xyzal for my allergies which can make you drowsy and before i went to bed without even thinking about it i took zzzquil to help me sleep
 zyrtec or xyzal but it could make you sleepy
 i kept wondering why ium falling asleep everywhere then i remembered i took xyzal uddude
 xyzal is the strongest allergy med i know but it makes u sleepy zzzngood luck
 hi angela we're sorry xyzal makes you so sleepy could you please give us a call at  so we can learn more about your experience? thanks
 hi we're sorry if xyzal made you sleepy could you please give us a call at  so we can learn more about your experience? thanks
 thanks for responding not a bad reaction just sleepy iuve been taking it for almost two years and itus never made me sleepyuntil i also began taking singulair at night and xyzal in the morning
 where my allergy sufferers atnnand did any of you switch to xyzal? no symptoms but i am sleepier than usual uddudca
 hmmmmmm so new specialists to see neuro allergistimmunologist  i had no idea histamine regulates the sleepwake cycle  now i'm wondering if taking otc zyrtec would help with sleeping too  if you become a medical detective please make me your watson i'm down
 tonight i'm loading up on benadryl so i can actually sleep without being up every  minutes to rub my itchy eyes zyrtec let me down
 have you tried the newer antihistamines like loratidine (claritin) fexofenadine (allegra) or even cetirizine (zyrtec)?  they are all over the counter and you may have better results than benadryl especially regarding sleepiness
 i am doing the allegra thing now and it is a huge improvement over the zyrtec that used to put me directly to sleep
 i guarantee you if i pop a zyrtec ium falling tf asleep though uddudcfudcudffcuddudcfudcudffc
 update the zyrtec helped actually got some sleep without wanting the claw my legs off maybe itull help at work too
 take one tablet of the non drowsy allergy and it makes me want to sleep all dang day legs feel like jello this common?
 zyrtec and benadryl put me to sleep more like a coma i use the fake allegra from costco it's the only non drowsy one that doesn't knock me out
 ium allergic to something that is thick in the air tonight hopefully the zyrtec kicks in soon so i can breathe and eventually sleep
 generic version of zyrtec d works wonders and you donut get sleepy best thing ever for allergies i promise
 i took  zyrtec because i was scared to sleep here by myself lmao now ium so tired for work
 i took zyrtec and now i'm suuuuuuper sleepy
 i think that looks like urticaria it's an allergic reaction it'll go down w meds get some zyrtec or if u want to sleep piriton
 ium gonna take zyrtec and sleep and hope ium not dead in the morning 
 i think i'm gonna fight sleep cause they changed but ew god i mean im just small children and try and like a zyrtec i'm not
 zyrtec benedryl just be putting people to sleep
 ever tried some of the alternate antihistamines?nclaratin zyrtec etc? some work fine (or better) for me without the sleepy feeling
 wow how do you stay awake?  every time i take the benedryl i go to sleep zyrtec doesn't do that to me though but it also doesn't  act fast like the good old benedryl it is a life saver
 when you sleep through dinner the rain the thunder the phone ringing you might be passed out from allergies thank you zyrtec udeudd
 i have pet allergies and apparently today at the vet something set them off my eyes are terribly gewy and my nose keeps running what can i take if i already take zyrtec daily? and benedryl is a no no for me it makes me drunk and so sleepy
 doctor you need to use a nasal rinse twice a day as well as zyrtec and also if you have any pain just alternate between ibuprofen and tylenol make sure to drink lots of water and get lots of sleepnnme the sleep part sounds doable
 zyrtec really be working for me but my nigga i be sleepy af the morning after i take it almost missed my stop on the train this morning
 i can take benadryl mg and zyrtec  mg and not fall asleep
 psa donut take zyrtec during the dayium somehow falling asleep and wired at the same time
 this is tricky each of us react differently but the one that does it for me is claritind hr if that doesnut work go with zyrtecd hr zyrtec makes me sleepy good luck i hate alergy season
 take zyrtec it wonut make you sleepy like benadryl does
 last night im going to work out tomorrow morning this morning damn it i didn't take a zyrtec sleep it is
 i really canut wait for allergy season to be over my is not working anymore i havenut been able to sleep through the night in over a week uddudedudduded sinusprobs allergies killme
 i followed my zyrtec with an advil pm and somehow ium still not sleeping great
 oh bummer ( ium fortunately not that bad but i came home the other day with a swollen face and blood red eyes and officially kicked claritin to the curb bonus zyrtec makes me sleepy perfect for before bed
 ium never taking zyrtec again it made me so drowsy that i had to leave the office and sleep for  hours
 shoutout to whoever sneezed while typing and gave me five shiny dollars for 'we'll sleep here tonight'nnand thank you for sneezing again when you picked up 'there's someone back home'nnget some zyrtec though i'm worriednndmsguild
 ohhhh zyrtec makes me super sleepy i am dealing with symptoms because itus better than sleeping but was prescribed claritin flonase and zyrtec (zantac to complement the zyrtec)
 i was finna wait til morning to take this zyrtec but i need something to dry me out before i go to sleep
 zyrtec allegra and claritin tablets should not make you drowsy  flonase or nasacort preventative nasal sprays shouldn't either pseudoephrine products like sudafed if you are congested generally give people more of a stimulant side effect rather than sleepiness
 hmm i found zyrtec works as an unintentional sleep aid kills allergies but you get dopey a half hour in and will sleep  hours or so if i can do research or anything to help please ask )
 zyrtec the only thing that doesnut make me sleepy udduded usually i take benadryl but only at night
 i am allergic to cats but i have five cats anyway  one spoons with me and another sleeps in my face  i just take zyrtec every day
 i should be sleep zyrtec 
 mostly i take zyrtec daily at night so sleepiness isn't an issue definitely add the nasacort  it helps sometimes have to take a decongestant as well makes some people jittery but i'm ok with it  best of luck
 yeah i'm sneezing all day every day nni recommend using nasacort  hr pillnzyrtec  hr pill makes you sleepy so take extra caution with this mednbenadryl antihistamines this makes you tired take caution when taking this medni hope this info helps lenard
 zyrtec or xyzal but it could make you sleepy
 before realizing benadryl sleepiness could be useful sometimes it was just generic zyrtec every twelve hours
 take a benodryl or zyrtec? sometimes i take one or  if i can't sleep since they make me drowsy
 it wonut really do anything if you double up iuve done it before with claritinzyrtec when ium in situations where my allergies will be really bad might make you a bit sleepy if anything
 zyrtec makes me sleepy af amp; claritin does not work at all for me
 the lnp i usually see is out sick so i'm seeing the dr who runs the practicennzyrtec makes me sleepy do you think that could be contributing?nndo i think an otc allergy med is a major factor in my chronic insomnia amp; plmd amp; being unable to keep my eyes open? nnno no i do not

 zyrtec should be non drowsy iuve never had an issue with it making me sleepy itus supposed to last  hours but thatus always questionable lots of people see decreased affect by the end of the day
 why am i up at am?? i have so many questions should i take a zyrtec to prevent my allergies?? should i wash my face?? should i eat??? why am i not sleeping??? why are my melatonin levels low at am???? relatable???
 benadryl zyrtec and prednisone and i still can't sleep udeudd
 claritin does diddly squat but i guess i could try upping the dosage too for zyrtec i like taking this benadryl cos it puts me to sleep lmaooo
 these allergies will be the death of me i need to pop a zyrtec and take my ass to sleep
 maybe try taking the pill of choice at bedtime? my doc suggested this amp; it cut down my grogginess on zyrtec the drowsiness is worst in the first  hours but itus a  hr med somake the first  hours the ones youure already asleep
 zyrtec or benadryl but you're going to sleep if you go benadryl
 the best nondrowsy allergy medicine ? ucause this zyrtec has me feeling all different types of sleepiness
 this zyrtec is putting me to sleep ium about to snooze at my desk uddude
 zyrtec can be a little expensive but a generic mg cetrizine (the active ingredient in zyrtec) does the exact same thing if the  mg doesn't work you can double up but it will make you sleepy so take it at night
 i wish zyrtec didnut make me sleepy allergyproblems
 i take zyrtec tablets and theyure effective and donut make me sleepy but only last for a few hours i find benadryl to be more effective but it makes me super drowsy
 benadryl only makes you sleepy if you don't need it but zyrtec will knock you out regardless
 its great for sleeping but its very difficult to function on it  very strong but effective difficult to get my work done  zyrtec not cutting it
 well some work better than others zyrtec gave me crazy nightmares and i had complete phone conversations while being asleep i donut remember them the people i talked to said i made sense
 this is tricky each of us react differently but the one that does it for me is claritind hr if that doesnut work go with zyrtecd hr zyrtec makes me sleepy good luck i hate alergy season
 sooo turns out when xyzal (a new allergy medication) says to take in the eveningthey are correct i woke up a couple times this morning but rolled over and went back to bed just got up and my fitbit says i got over  and a half hours of sleep last night

 if you select the second option you'll be connected to a representative that handles calls from people that used xyzal we're glad it works and sorry it makes you sleepy
 xyzal shit is real it even says to take it in the evening aka exactly when you'd like to go to sleep and don't get less than  hours of sleep while taking it that's just personal experience uddude0uddude0 thisshitisbananas
 psa if youuve never taken the allergy med xyzal read the directions  you take it at night and let me say it kicked bobus butt heus falling asleep at the table
 i can forget my depresso meds for a day and be generally okay other than having trouble sleeping but gotta take the zyrtec daily or death itus when i donut take antidepresso for like two days then i am hell
 took zyrtec last night it worked well but i am surprised at the lack of sleep i got last night uddude0 i thought it was suppose to make you drowsy it was the complete opposite of that
 also expirement with claritin amp; allegra each person seems to do better with each option my chemistry seems to work best with zyrtec nnthat being said i think flonase was the silver bullet since it covers more symtoms you can pick a  day supply fairly cheap no sleepies
 it can if i take it in the morning which is why i switched to taking it at night it seems if i do that i sleep off whatever drowsy effects zyrtec gives me and i'm fine in the morning nnyou can also cut the mg pill in half and that might help as well
 i've been around cats since i was born developed an allergy at  zyrtec twice a day lets me live in a house with many cats including this dork who always sleeps like this as long as i can breathe and don't want to tear my skin off it's actually very calming thanks zyrtec 
 i cant sleep so great and my allergies are acting a fool and i took zyrtec when i should have taken benedryl uddudebuddudebuddudedudduded
 shit i'm allergic to damn near everything you can easily take a  hour zyrtec at night before going to sleep and be good all day the next day lol nni think he just didn't want the dog sitting behind himwhat if it stank? didn't they put a person off a plane that stank? uddude0
 poor baby i use to take benadryl but it made me sleepy so my momma told me about zyrtec and i havenut had any issues
 the second gens like claritin allegra etc are supposed to be non drowsy but not always the case i donut have issues with allegra and sleepiness zyrtec i did benadryl is a first gen antihistamine which is why it makes people so sleepy
 zyrtec is the best iuve used nallegra is pretty similar nbenadryl is fast but puts you to sleep nclaritin is trash 
 seriously zyrtec has messed me up after just a couple dosesnni took it for hives  they're far worse now that i'm trying to stop taking itnni now have a pain my shoulders that i didn't have until i started taking zyrtec it's excruciating i can't sleep because it's so bad
 it takes literally a full hour for me to calm my anxiety before sleeping  popping a zyrtec  doses of cbd and a bag of crystals
 yany ham makhtha zyrtec and im not sleeping  i just feel dizzy
 also zyrtec works wonders if you donut want to be sleepy from benadryl i get hives every day for no apparent reason if i donut take zyrtec but with it i donut get any
 no wonder my ass was sleepy i thought i was taking my zyrtec but it was benadryl uddudebuddude0
 claritin is literally the only one i can take benadryl is a no brainier since it's also used as a sleep aid zyrtec just makes me feel like i am constantly zoning out i've tried flonase too and that shit would make me feel a bit existential especially if i drove after taking it
 zyrtec puts you to sleep?
 i need a zyrtec d real bad but i got endless clients and ium running off two hours of sleep
 haha i hate benadryl zyrtec d is great for allergies also the tripping part isnt what scares me i feel like iud mix booze and sleep meds and never wake up lol
 tried claritin and it did nothing for me zyrtec helps but doesn't do enough and makes me sleepy all the time benadryl works great but knocks me completely out zyrtec is closest so far but it's been getting worse the past few years
 zyrtec makes me sleepy; i do a twice daily allegra which usually works but has now forsaken me
 bruh canut take zyrtec no more puts my ass to sleep
 half a pain pill a muscle relaxer my sleeping pill and zyrtec how am i having insomnia right now? 
 i am so sensitive to allergy medicine i took one zyrtec and feel like i could sleep for days
 the worst part about  hour allergy pills is when you donut remember if you took it that day so itus ucdo i die from a zyrtec overdoseud or ucdo i die in my sleep because i canut breatheud
 don't mind me y'allmy happy ass shoud have been asleep  hrs ago i think my zyrtec is broken so i guess i'll just tweet through ituddude0uddude0e
 shit did they give you anything for it? claritin or zyrtec and benadryl (if possible) the good stuff requires a prescription and makes you sleepy so you donut know youure itching lol
 benadryl puts me to sleep i take zyrtec i didn't see any benadryl spray so i put some calagel on the rash and it stopped the itching it has benadryl and calomine in it
 how drowsy that zyrtec made me fell asleep for  hours today 
 my super solid sleep was courtesy of xyzel which is one of the enatiomers of zyrtec's main ingredient i've been taking generic claritin because it's on hand but it's feeling less effective so i need to switch over to the zyrtec or allerga equivalents probably
 a clinic doc recommended zyrtec to me bc it ucauses less drowsinessu and i took one and then immediately fell asleep for four hours
 i got huge miserable itchy welts from deer flies took zyrtec soaked in epson salts amp; took a magnesium pill at night (makes me sleepy) which really helped with the awful itching  they last for weeksudeudduduufe0f  magnesium seemed the key factor for me get better soon
 zyrtec before you sleep does wonders

 zyrtec from cosco under  and has about  tablets will make you drowsy over the counter sleeping pills from walmart also do the trick
 just read that the active form of hydoxyzine is cetirizine which is zyrtec zyrtec doesnut make you sleepy so vistaril is basically zyrtec with a sedative property (?)   i think iull ask the pharmacist about this

 zyrtec and i do not get along  had sleep paralysis nightly which is essentially hallucinations as you are drifting off to sleep no thank you
 nah they work on different levels benadryl is much more immediate and targets reactions like itching whereas a zyrtec is a long release oneaday i just had a lump taken outta my armpit and the itching was unreal so there's my experience lol makes you sleepy tho
 i took some benadryl zyrtec and melatonin because ium not even remotely sleepy but i need to go to sleep uddude
 ium wondering if itus the combination of zyrtec and vitamin d at night i used to take my vitamin d in the afternoon either that or itus because ium not sleeping well because my nose is so stuffy ium not sleeping well but i canut stay awake which equals no reading udduded
 i canut even lay down or fall asleep anymore without having to take a zyrtec or some nyquil because of how congested my nasal passages get canut i just get one night of clear sinuses?

  mg zyrtec mg zantac x daily and mg hydroxyzine and mg mirtazipine before bed they help aid sleep too i also do intermittent fasting which helps calm my mast cells enough to eat with less painbloatsickness

 just before cedar season starts each year i start taking zyrtec to get it in my system amp; i always forget how sleepy it makes me nodding off in front of the tv
 i just want sleep ium finna cry just took a zyrtec
 hope inosine amp; ldn both help as for the zyrtec studies show it does cause drowsiness in  of the population  sounds like you are in that group one solution is to take it at bedtime  that's what i do then the worst of the sleepiness is while you're asleep
 ) emergenc stat am amp; pm  (as a hot tea) i prefer the raspberry n) zyrtec stat (it will dry you out so that it doesnut go to your chest)n) gargle  cup of water tsp peroxide  tsp salt  crushed aspirin garlic powder n) sleep ni swear by this feel better soon
 thatus why i fell asleep earlier while watchinu youtube took a zyrtec and a benadryl
 i'm not liking the zyrtec at all  his coughing and sniffles definitely disappeared for the most part but once he takes it it takes him forever to fall asleep and then he stays asleep alot longer than normal

 before i go to bed every night i gotta take allergy meds (zyrtec if im tired benadryl if i think iull need help falling asleep) because my allergies get bold while im asleep and painkillers so i donut have a headache when i wake up

 waiting for zyrtec to make me fall asleep peacefullyudeudd
 i love take zyrtec in the mornings and benadryl at night for allergies i almost took benadryl this morning iud have been sleeping on cam
 sons nthe same effect happens to us with claritin and zyrtec the only antihistamines we can take without negative mental health issues are really glucorticoids (not sure on spelling) like flonase benadryl causes sleepiness and loopiness for us but not depression
 i feel like shit dosed myself on tylenol zyrtec and benedryl in an attempt to make it through an almost  mile round trip day such a rough drive ium so tired had to pull over twice to get out and stretch and get caffeine so i didnut fall asleep at the wheel
 why are you questioning that you are sleepy? itus a first generation antihistamineit makes one sleepyshoulda gone second gen with zyrtec or claritin
 ask your pharmacist if you have questionsnsome antihistamines cause less sleepiness than others these include cetirizine (zyrtec) desloratadine (clarinex) fexofenadine (allegra) amp; loratadine (claritin)ndo not drink alcohol when you're taking antihistamines
 itus zyrtec plus i think i should just go to sleep
 allergies canut breathe outta my uddudc canut sleep despite already taking a zyrtec
 pls be careful uddudea zyrtec is just like benadryl but doesnut make you sleepy so u can take that anytime of the day

 i went from zyrtec xs a day plus benedryl to sleep to  zyrtec every  days if your current antihistamines doesnut work switch neither claritin nor allegra work for me
 benadryl might make you sleepy but allegra and claritin should be non drowsy zyrtec should be non drowsy but doesnut specify
 wouldnut take benadryl during the day because you might want to sleep all day ha ha ha i would only take it at night maybe take that zyrtec during the day unless that decongestant youure taking works well enough
 it sounds like allergies  have you tried zyrtec? maybe benadryl at night?  it will help you sleep

 that zyrtec got me real sleepy today uddude
 yes zyrtec is the best and it doesnut make you sleepy

 tw  medication overdose emetophobiannhey uh just a heads up bc i had no idea either but allergy meds (specifically zyrtec) and alevenaproxen do not mix well im okay now after sleeping amp; hydrating but it had me feeling very dizzy nauseous drowsy amp; unable to focus earlier
 much better some chicken noodle soup zyrtec warm apple juice and lots of sleep was all i needed nose still a bit stuffy but it's going away
 same i have four now had two then allegra or zyrtec or fexofenadine ( canut remember the brand name) might work better than benadryl without the sleepy side affects i am impressed with how much the allergen febreeze helps the situation
 so last night i was freaking out about the cough and why it wonut go away then i remember i always get post nasal drip when ium sick i didnut go to bed until am cause i was drinking water and took a zyrtec woke up at pm  hours of sleep i guess i needed it
 zantac is for heartburn nzyrtec is for allergiesnzoloft is for depression nzymil is a lactose free milknzzzquil is for sleep
 was just reading about zyrtec and it's explicitly listed as having drowsiness as a side effect so careful on that one (supplemental info i've been trying to make it work and at both mg and mg has made me extremely sleepy)
 you can take zyrtec or claritin before the pain med instead of benadryl (they wonut make you sleepy like benadryl)
 zyrtec is anti allergy uncle not a sleeping pill meme banai hei khud meme ban jaogy

 i've been stuck on trips sleep overs etc where i've had to explain my sudden and dire need to get to a cvs the easiest way to explain the issue is saying jokingly i'm addicted the zyrtec it's a bit embarrassing this to admit but it's really true i cant live without it
 between  hours of not taking zyrtec my hands and feet begin to itch and not just a bug bite itch an intense deep itch in my hands and feet that drives you mad and spreads i cant sleep i cant work i cant do anything until it's gone the only way to stop it take zyrtec
 i been sleepy since i clocked in to work this morning and i jus now realized why i took zyrtec today and benadryl udeuddfuddude0 jesusss

 taking zyrtec at night only for it to keep you awake all night but it and no sleep keep you sleepy during class but you drank coffee in the morning which is keeping you awake amp; so you're like in this rhythmic state of being sleepy and awake at the same time and your body is like 
 zyrtec is what works for me i use benadryl if ium having them at night because it helps me sleep

 claritin makes my heart race i take zyrtec every day benadryl puts me to sleep ibuprofen makes me puke i am a mess of allergies )
 have you tried zyrtec? i have better luck with that and it doesnut make me sleepy though you can always just take it at bedtime if you have that problem
 this zyrtecd is having a pronged effectnn i want to fall asleep (and legit thought about asking my vp if i can sleep in her office til it wears off)n go outside and walk in the rainn start a disco party at work
 i only take it at night bc it makes meuddude xyzal is even worse for sleepiness it definitely works but even after hrs of sleep i was still zonked out works for hrs amp; keeps you groggy for hrs
 i've been using xyzal for almost  years now (used to be prescription only) amp; it helps me more than every other allergy pill out there i take it with my other night meds before i go to sleep amp; it works the entire next day also cvs is the only place i've found a generic for it
 trevor's mom was recommending xyzal and said they have a  pills for  on their website right now she said it makes you sleepy but you dont wake up drowsy
 zantac will not make you sleepy is my point if you use either one of the others (xyzal or zyrtec ) you have only  thatus could make you drowsy sleep but mix with zantac
 then why am i in a small coma if i take zyrtec or xyzal? legit sleep  hours a day and tired the  ium awake ium not trying to be snarky i just need relief from the weapons grade pollen in the pnw without needing to hibernate during the few months we have sun
 fortunately the xyzal ium using seems to be keeping the live oak at bay chlorpheniramine is my fallback though itus getting harder to find diphenhydramine is last resort it messes with my sleep
 there may not be such thing as nondrowsy antihistamines one study shows even newer nondrowsy allergy medication examples like clarinex zyrtec and xyzal cause significant daytime sleepiness and worse  
 yeah xyzal is good but you have to take it regularly it might make you a bit sleepy
 losing sleep because of daylight savings is hard enough donut let allergies keep you up too spring into action and get your day sample of xyzal here  
 my mission is to sleep with no cold or allergy meds threw away xyzal cause yes it kinda works close to  hours but it makes you drowsy the whole time it be great for a  hour flightuddudef no donut do it
 i dont need zyrtec to knock the fuck out lol sleepybitch
 zyrtec kicks my butt i take at night and it will also help me sleep can't take too many nights in a row or i can't shake the drowsy daze
 all the time i only take zyrtec if ium home and ready to sleep uddude
 when you live the allergy life itus trial amp; error to find the right drug benedryl knocks me out zyrtec works perfectly claritin makes me sleepy amp; allegra only last an hour
 i used to live off zyrtec bc of allergies as a kid and it never made me sleepy lol
 zyrtec makes a lot of people sleepy but not me  i actually take it in the morning uddude0
 when zyrtec used to be prescription my dr told me to take it a bedtime because it makes you very sleepy uddudca
 zyrtec makes me sleepy also
 affects me the same way when i need to sleep i take a zyrtec it is great for allergies cut it in half next time
 zyrtec makes me sleepy even the non drowsy allegra non drowsy works the best
 zyrtec has never made me sleepy thatus why i prefer it over benadryl hmmm
 zyrtec always gives me the best sleep 
 i took a zyrtec earlier but started falling asleep at work they checked my blood sugar before anything else thinking i was diabetic uddude
 in high school i would take  x zyrtec every day bc i had such bad allergies and would always always fall asleep in class i was working at a pharmacy n one day a customer told me she gave them to her dad as sleeping pills
 antihistamines are in sleeping pills and in zyrtec
 my notquiteyo was just prescribed zyrtec earlier this week by her pediatrician; doc chose zyrtec specifically because itus supposed to be nondrowsy i havenut had any calls or emails or anything from teachers yet claiming sheus sleeping in class sooo 
 both zyrtec and claritin make me feel sleepy  i like allegra no sleepy time for me with that stuff
 zyrtec makes me sleepy try allegra
 i didn't have any problems with zyrtec for years til one day i was driving to work and came close to sleeping at the wheel luckily it was only  min away from where i live and no traffic at all
 zyrtec can make you sleepy at recommended doses if you want real nondrowsy you should try allegra
 omggg gorl this happened to me the other night i noticed i was starting to get spring allergies n i pooped a zyrtec for the first time since last year n i fell asleep so hard n woke up w major brain fog whatus in the new zyrtec ??? i need answers 
 zyrtec makes me sleepy nclaritin doesnut tho
 zyrtec will make me mildly drowsy but not like a sleeping aid other people i know take it first thing in the am and have no drowsiness whatsoever it seems to have very different effects on everyone udeuddudcudffbuduufe0f
 zyrtec makes me sleepy too but claritin works great for me and no sleepiness
 my allergies have had me on a zyrtec for life always sleepy never sniffly uddude
 also in pnw with tree pollen allergies i like claritan or allegra rather than zyrtec but i'll take zyrtec at night to breathe and sleep rain is coming; that will help
 i had some serious issues with zyrtec but my body is weird like that i experienced a rebound effect (rash) when i stopped taking the drug and had to wean myself off i also couldnut sleep it made me crazy
 zyrtec takes a few days to get in to your system  i used to take it for my allergies and would sleep all day the first few days bc it had to get back into my system  after a few days it normalizes and youure not ucsupposedud to be drowsy
 count me as one of the small percentage of people that gets drowsy from zyrtec so now i take it right when i go to bed and itus strong enough to work  the next day bonus i sleep great
 zantac will not make you sleepy is my point if you use either one of the others (xyzal or zyrtec ) you have only  thatus could make you drowsy sleep but mix with zantac
 then why am i in a small coma if i take zyrtec or xyzal? legit sleep  hours a day and tired the  ium awake ium not trying to be snarky i just need relief from the weapons grade pollen in the pnw without needing to hibernate during the few months we have sun
 oh man i hate that maybe you also have allergies zyrtec usually helps me but it makes me sleepy for a long time
 hey good to see you too sitting on the couch with zyrtec at my feet sleepy but don't wanna get up haha
 i took it too  i guess i discovered my problem  iuve taken everything but my allergiesare no where near as bad as they once were  zyrtec is a nice little sleep aid also
 i fall asleep within an hour of taking it itus as bad as taking zyrtec or a sleeping pill
 i take zyrtec it's the only thing that doesn't make me sleepy
 life pro tip donut mix  hours of sleep sudafed mucinex zyrtec monster tequila and coffee on a day you missed your antidepressant my brain zaps are wild and i almost fell asleep standing up udeuddudcudffbuduufe0f
 zyrtec is milder than benadryl doesnut make as sleepy
 zyrtec or claritin along with flonase  every morning my dr said if it makes you sleepy take it before you go to bed  i've done that and was so good in the morning
 zyrtec d worked amazing for me when i had bad allergies months ago i couldnut even breathe or sleep but the pharmacist recommended zyrtec d so i tried it itus kinda pricey but itus worth it
 i accidentally took two zyrtec and that shit fucked me up lmao i fell asleep for a whole  hours uddudc
 down side to zyrtec sleepy uddude
 neti pot before you go to sleep and in the morning zyrtec and nasarel good luck 
 oddly i had this after i had my son i was put on claritin and zyrtec at the same time benadryl if it got very bad and told to rest thanks to the drowsy meds i got plenty of sleep
 i figured but still nnprotip to kick off taking antihistamines take a zyrtec allegra or claritin w a hr chlortrimeton tablet at night on day  and that very often jump starts that  day delay period you experience so it works on day one this will make you very sleepy tho
 still struggle with sleep wake up at  am everyday without fail unless i take a zyrtec before i go to bed then i have brain and zyrtec fog the next dayudeuddudcudffduduufe0fudeuddudcudffduduufe0f
 i was tired because i took nyquil and zyrtec which makes me sleepy
 i take claritin d zyrtec and montelukast when it's bad when it's really bad i say fuck it take a benadryl and go to sleep

 i took a zyrtec some zquil and rubbed some cbd oil on my messed up shoulder last night before bedbest sleep i've had in a long time  nni also do better at work when i've got a handle on my other priorities  i feel like you've had a lot going on outside of work lately
 there may not be such thing as nondrowsy antihistamines one study shows even newer nondrowsy allergy medication examples like clarinex zyrtec and xyzal cause significant daytime sleepiness and worse  
 last night i took a zyrtec some zquil and put some cbd oil on my shoulder that has been acting up best sleep i've had in weeks
 fyi you can take zyrtec twice a day if once isnut working iuve been doing it for at least a decade because being allergic to cats while having  of them is not ideal keeps things manageable toss in a benadryl at night for extra help and sleep as needed
 she also just gave me a zyrtec and a ucsleeping pillud so i think my mum just roofied me uddudca
 uchow do people make electricity?udnuchow do you make the color white?udnuchow do people see clear?udnuchow did god make blood?udnnall just now in a row and sheus had zyrtec and sheus not even sleepy

 here's my plan ) take zyrtec and live my entire life exhausted ) give up on zyrtec because i'm so tired all the time ) stop sleeping at night because i can't breathe and live my entire life exhausted ) repeatnncare to join?
 careful with benadryl and otc with benadryllike antihistamine as that may cause drowsiness  also zyrtec can interrupt sleep so best to take it the morning if that happens  flonase also helps to shrink the swelling in nasal cavities so can use with your allergy meds
 he actually has a cold two nights of zyrtec hasnut done shit for either the cold or the sleep iull try benadryl tonight for the former obvs

 yeah benadryl is for allergies but it can make u sleepy everyone responds differently to different things zyrtec has always worked best for me claritin does well but i find it has to build up in ur system for a few days before it works i'd recommend zyrtec hour personally

 while allegra zyrtec claritin and even xyzal are all ucnondrowsyuc some people still report getting tired others report being unable to sleep
 xyzal is the best big man will make you a little sleepy so take it at night
 if you're allergic to mold you should probably be taking medication every day since there is mold inside and outside zyrtec makes me sleepy so i take xyzal

 in not spring i use zyrtec as a mild sleep aid for me it doesnut give the hangover that benadryl does but doesnut knock me out either
 zyrtec is the best i'll stop itching amp; be asleep in  mins flatuddudeuddude0
 i've found it's best to pair with flonase plus saline spray zyrtec and claritin work with different allergens so it depends on your allergies they also take  days of use before benefits are maximized benadryl is better overall but makes you sleepy shots work best
 of course zyrtec puts me to sleep when i'm working and keeps me awake when i want to sleep
 i told you zyrtec wonut put you to sleep
 yep a little worse every year taking zyrtec twice daily pretty much only saves me from drowning in my sleep
 benadryl does not work for me at all but apparently most people who use it get mad sleepy amp; zyrtec be having me drink a shit load of water and still be having a dry mouth

 insomnia can fudeuddcudeuddck off i didnut sleep at all last night at allllll my allergies (which iuve never had ever) must be the reason why zyrtec d cough suppressant and steroids are keeping me up at night? idk get me through this  hr work day uddudefudcudffcuddude
 damn cough wonut quit looks like little to no sleep again tonight i hate allergies as much as i hate being sick loratadine doesnut do the job anymore amp; zyrtec isnut very effective off to chug pei pa koa syrup
 my coworker gave me zyrtec for my allergies i asked if it's drowsy she told he it doesn't make her drowsy i immediately fell asleep after coming home from work and i'm barely waking up uddudcuddudcuddudc
 same lol yesterday i took a zyrtec and almost fell asleep at my desk while i was working so back to claritin today lol
 while allegra zyrtec claritin and even xyzal are all ucnondrowsyuc some people still report getting tired others report being unable to sleep
 it honestly probably is it took me a few days to make the connection but starting last week i kept hitting hit with the weirdest fatigue in the afternoon i would literally fall asleep sitting up  i started taking zyrtec to see if it's the pollen
 took prescription zyrtec out of desperation and forgot how taking one of those means you want to sleep for the rest of your life uddude
 if you're allergic to mold you should probably be taking medication every day since there is mold inside and outside zyrtec makes me sleepy so i take xyzal
 i always get nervous with drugs on work daysnnlike should i take the claritin or the zyrtec? am i going to be asleep by lunch or?
 sneezing constantly is a buzz kill but eventually you just have to embrace it like a headache zyrtec will make you dry inside eventually but it takes time benadryl kicks in fast but will make you sleepy even at child doses flonase gets things moving more efficiently
 wait before you go to sleep can i take a zyrtec and melatonin? lol
 i like xyzal the best i find it to be stronger than allegra and claritin specially since i canut take zyrtec cause it makes me way too sleepy
 what abt vitamin c tabtry zyrtec tab one before fall and dont cover ur face while sleeping
 zyrtec help to clear the symptoms but makes me very very sleepy
 i thought i was taking zyrtec but my half asleep ass just took like  benadryls good night again
 a zyrtec amp; two white claw hard seltzers niull be asleep before pm uddudeuddudecuddude0 
 lol gon and take that zyrtec d you gone go right back to sleep
 zyrtec a couple benadryl and sometimes melatonin nnit takes a lot of benadryl to put me out i take mg nightly for allergies amp; don't get sleepy anymorenna rheumy told me some ppl don't make enough melatonin and it causes sleep disruption
  benadryl helps immediately but will probably make you sleepy zyrtec or claratin helps even store generic ones get some nasal spray for sure get some eye gel pads i use them for my migraines they feel awesome u
 a daily antihistamine adds  hrs to my normal natural sleep cycle has anyone else noticed this? nnhrs like clockwork when not taking;  hrs while taking happens with both claritin and zyrtec active ingredientsudeudd
 have u tried a nasal spray?? i ditched the claritin and zyrtec iuve been using flonase and i can breath again i donut sneeze at work all day ium not blowing my nose constantly i can sleep at night no more eyes and i donut have to take it everyday
 i started taking my zyrtec at night too because while it's way less sleep provoking it still made me tired during the day
 oh man doesnt the benadryl put you to sleep?? ium on daily zyrtec (rd gen antihistamine) and flonase when it gets bad have you looked into drops or shots? had shots in hs and helped get me off benadryl
 idk if you have allergies but zyrtec is really good for making you sleepy or benedryl
 antibiotic zyrtec flonase uddude recommended to avoid the mold (hard to do considering it's our house)udeudd and a possible allergist referral in the future    i just want my ribs to not hurt to breathe and to sleep a 
 honestly zyrtec is the best sleeping pill iuve ever taken
 nope iuve been taking zyrtec at night and it helps a lot benadryl makes me sleepy too fastuddude0
 it is the pollen times here in ga which means i chave to choose between restless nights or taking a zyrtec and sleeping for  hours straight i alternate every other day for functionality purposes nnisthisalifehack
 when you want to stay up all night and write all the things for campnanowrimo but are on your first few days of zyrtec for the year worked an  hour day coached highschool volleyball and then got amazing feedback on a different wip and need a shower and sleep writerproblems
 allegra makes my heart race  but i have heart palpitations from stress and i just can't take it anymore (army veteran)  now i'd rather get a little sleepy from zyrtec then all agitated from allegra udeudd
 zyrtec i was sleepy for the first  days but then it went away no other side effects plus it lasts  hours it costs more but there are generic versions claritin is good too no side effects and lasts all day but isnut as strong at zyrtec
 zyrtec  allegra  elite allergy relief plus all day sleep 
 you might try a halfdose of generic zyrtec (cetirizine) at night (it makes me sleepy af) and see if you clear up if you do thatu00bs probably it i had to futz with different antihistamines because most of them mess me up so u might go to your doc if that turns out to be it
 zyrtec is less likely to make you sleepy but it still can allegra is the least sedating or try claritin
 i took half a zyrtec and fell asleep itus potent
 i wish zyrtec put me to sleep lol
 ucdo you want a zyrtec?ud nnucno i donut like to take anything   because i take ambien to sleepud nnoverheard
 it does it to me a sleeping pill  it can be a side effect is what the zyrtec pharm rep told me
 zyrtec will make me sleepy for the entire  hours it says itus effective for uddude
 my friend penny loves to sleep on top of people are you sure your allergies will be ok?nnme downing a bottle of zyrtec like a shot what's an allergy
 yep zyrtec is like a sleeping pill for me  you are not alone
 you ever try zyrtec or something of that nature? did wonders for me as a kid and it didnut make me go to sleep  minutes after taking it lol
 on this week's intelligent medicine radio show  sleep paralysis explained; zyrtec withdrawal symptoms keep allergy sufferers hooked;  of health reviews underreport side effects of medications procedures; antidepressants uniformly cause weight gain 
 zyrtec once made me sleep for a continuous  hours  best day of my life 
 i took nondrowsy zyrtec and still lost all of saturday to sleep
 i take a zyrtec d every day and it controls my allergies beautifully if i take a regular zyrtec i sleep for the entire day udeudduduufe0f
 zyrtec makes me sleepy the entire next day  i had to switch to allegra per the recommendation of my allergist he said fatigue is the  side effect of zyrtec
 zyrtec makes me sooooo sleepy even taking it at night i wake up groggy the next day allegra makes me too buzzed so i stick with alavertnasal rinsesacupuncture to treat allergies
 try telfast there arenut as many side effects with it but for me it doesnut work as well as zyrtec and claritin and yep ium knocked out cold or fighting sleep after taking zyrtec too
 yes i used to start getting drowsy in the car and just thought i was not sleeping enough switched to claritin and haven't had that issue since i took zyrtec for years
 i take zyrtec x a day  i can barely function if i donut no sleepies
 i had to switch to allegra because zyrtec made sleepy it did work better for my allergies though sometimes helped to take a half dose
 it makes me sleepy too but the allergies were unbearable and zyrtec works best for me iuve tried everything else
 zyrtec is the one that makes me really sleepy
 benadryl does that to me but zyrtec just makes me sleep harder but not like knocked out
 some medications work opposite on people the same meds may cause excitability or may cause drowsiness if zyrtec doesn't work for you try claritin it's the same medication wa different active ingredient personally like zyrtecd but have to take it by am or can't sleep
 i canut function w zyrtec  leaves me in a daze but not sleepy   my sister can run a marathon after taking one but benadryl knocks her out  she is weird 
 yup zyrtec low key a sleeping pill 
 zyrtec causes the most drowsiness of the second generation antihistamines which also incl claritin and allegra first generation antihistamine incl benadryl which is the active ingredient in most over the counter sleep aids uddudeuddude
 some medications work opposite on people the same meds may cause excitability or may cause drowsiness if zyrtec doesn't work for you try claritin it's the same medication wa different active ingredient personally like zyrtecd but have to take it by am or can't sleep

 zyrtec for daytime chlor tripolin for sleep  i swear by this combo
 allegra isnut too bad zyrtec if you need to sleep
 claritin or zyrtec benadryl works best but it makes you super sleepy so itus good at night time
 take a zyrtec they also have over the counter inhalers (i use them) drink lots of water to loosin whatever is in your lungs and maybe a mucinex make sure itus not the sleep one
 ahhh weure to the point in allergy season where taking my daily zyrtec using my nasal spray and eye drops isnut enough letus hope the added benadryl and ice pack on my eyes helps me sleep udeuddudcudffcuduufe0fudduded mywholefaceitches

 take a  hour allergy medicine right before you go to bed  i take zyrtec you get a good night sleep and you wake up without allergy symptoms until you go to bed
 omg girl my life is  allergies amp; allergy meds right now call me any time if itus a permanent development amp; not just a random onetime reaction start zyrtec or claritin instead of benedryl (diphenhydramine is also a sleep aid amp; can mess up your sleep cycle w long term use)
 popped another benadryl just tobget sleep for work and temp relief from these allergies because apparently my usual allergy team force of zyrtec flonase and eye drops arenut working this season oh amp; im asthmatic oh this season of allergyus is wonderful uddudee
 i agree that this is irresponsible also needs to put on their labels information about withdrawal syndrome i was put on for my allergies but it caused heart issues and when i went off and switched medications i had bad hives to the point i couldn't sleep
 psa did you know that zyrtec is not a nondrowsy allergy med as someone with a sleep disorder that causes daytime sleepiness you would think that either my sleep doc or my allergy doc would have pointed this out to me you know where i found out? twitter
 dude i feel you they make me so sleepy but in my experience zyrtec works really well uddude0
 use zyrtec  it works and won't leave you feeling sleepy uddude0

 it's only nondrowsy in comparison to benadryl which is knockout drugs zyrtec always makes me sleepy claritin doesn't make me sleepy but it doesn't work very fast and if you're in a full blown allergy attack it doesn't work at all where's the happy medium lol?
 zyrtec  hr wears off in  hours for me tho zyrtec insensitive ium very caffeine sensitive if i drink even iced tea too late in the day i need to take a benadryl to counteract the caffeine or i donut sleep downers to counter the uppers udeudda

 all allergy medicines except zyrtec and claritin make me itchy and all of them make me sleepy or dizzy do i can only take them at night i had to go to an allergist recently to get steroids to calm down my allergies a bit uddude0
 bro i took  zyrtec and now ium so fucking sleepy but ium at work so i canut sleep
 why the hell does zyrtec make me so damn sleepy uddude
 xyzal owl talks bold about benadryl which you only take to go to sleep or if youure having an allergy attack but he is too much of a coward to take on zyrtec
 zyrtec or whatever generic brand there isnnif you're dealing with like being super congested and not being able to sleep because of having trouble breathing then i'd also recommend afrin nasal spray that stuff will clear you up for a few hours
 zyrtec they make look little but theyre rly effectivennalt (for itchy  very bad) benadryl tho this stuff can be killer bc sometimes u just pass out asleep and it makes u feel weird and fuzzy
 never had allergies or sneezed much until i was like  then all hell broke loose i sneeze all the time have to take zyrtec to sleep through the stuffy nose for no apparent reason doesn't matter the environment food or animals sneeze and hate it
 took zyrtec at work and didnt know it causes drowsiness   just fell asleep standing up while scanning a patient 
 after years of using melatonin  mg amp; zyrtec i finally got better (not great) sleep by adding magnesium and low dose naltrexone years of very little normal sleep took a huge toll feels weird to feel brain shut down in a more normal waynow to figure out refreshing sleep
 wait for flonase to work ntake zyrtec anywaynoversleepnrepeat 
 just waiting for my zyrtec to kick in so my skin can stop crawling and i can fall asleep
 i thought i was coming down with the flu one time last year i took one of my sisterus zyrtec and went to sleep the next morning i felt better
 me ok i need to breathe but i also don't wanna just sleep all day so uhhh gonna try some zyrtec instead of benadrylnmy allergies haaaa hahaha haaaaaaaa that's a funny joke now you're gonna get sleepy anyway and it won't help the snifflingnme (ufu00b0uau00b0uff0ufufe ubuub why
 zyrtec is good and i really like taking the advil allergy and sinus the advil works really well for me and doesnut make me sleepy
 nondrowsy allegras knock you out? damn zyrtec would do that to me despite being nondrowsy claritan was soso for me nni assume you've got a sensitivity to sleep medications in general? a benadryl will knock you out hard?
 i could not sleep one wink last night due to allergies thanks for nothing zyrtec
 beware that if you react badly to diphenhydramine it can flare anxiety and hallucinations most otc sleep aids are just variously branded diphenhydramine nna small glass of tonic water might helpnn(just fyi zyrtec also causes me anxiety but claritin amp; allegra do not)
 i might be sleep when the awards come on udeudd i gotta take a zyrtec
 like i woke up from a nap and im still sleepy but i also took some zyrtec this morning so maybe thatus why udeudd
 i do flonase zyrtec pain reliever and back to sleep helped
 when zyrtec hits you hardnnsleepyatwork dxbhustling
 update i took some zyrtec and had my first night of sleep that i didnut wake up once since i moved here
 does the zyrtec keep you up at night or are you able to sleep while on it? sometimes decongestants screw with my sleeping patterns
 i took an allergy pill for the first time in a long time yesterday and to keep from falling asleep before pm i needed three cold brews and about 000 calories of carbs zyrtec should be a schedule i drug
 ium  minutes into a couple benadryl and a zyrtec and nothing is happening they arenut taking the itchiness away they arenut making me sleeping nothing nada zilch
 idk why but it has the opposite effect on me i will be lucky if i can sleep  hours in the next  days and even though ium awake ium like a zombie can barely function i hate zyrtec but damn i need some relief uddudee
 i finally had to break down and take a zyrtec this evening and now i can feel it coming on the dry mouth the unquenchable thirst the munchies the weird hazy semisleepy euphoric feeling itus like ium lost in the forest mirkwood after smoking a pound of weed
 yes itus called zyrtec in the us and i found a bottle at the bottom of my travel bag allegra doesnut do anything and benadryl just makes me sleepy but still itchy  which is the worst
 have you tried nasacort?nnyou could probably choose the hr cycle zyrtec and take it before you go to sleep to minimize drowsiness when you wake up
 ten hours of sleep omg that zyrtecmelatonin combo be hitting
 mine are horrible this year flonase isnut totally doing it but allegra gives me a bad headache and zyrtec makes me too sleepy to work and claritin doesnut do shit ugh
 popping zyrtec so yuall fall asleep like this gt;gt;gt; 
 i take zyrtec claritin has never worked for me whatever you try iud suggest taking it before bed that way you sleep through any drowsiness
 not sure i can sleep tonight since i took zyrtec for the first time to relieve my horrific sunburn so i might go to the club? lol ium the messiest person i know fr fr
 ium so frustrated zyrtec doesnut work benadryl makes me sleep for days ium immune to claritin amp; allegra nothing works anymore my eyes constantly drip and my bladder muscles canut sustain the power of hay fever help i need something guaranteed to work seasonalallergies 
 so zyrtec makes me super sleepy i can't take it because i will literally sleep for  hours but xyxal (which is basically a metabolite of zyrtec) does not make me sleepy at all so that is what i take for allergies

 how many mg of zyrtec do i take to make me go to sleep
 allegra hasn't made me sleepy either the other difference is that the tablets i have are only for  hours though while claritin and zyrtec are  hours
 yes this i take claritin every night before bed exactly for this reason (also helps me sleep better becausebreathing)  some people swear by zyrtec but i can't take itmakes me dizzy both are  hr pills i think there's a rd brand that's also supposed to be good

 i fell asleep at pm because the zyrtec i ate kicked in  hours late
 at this point zyrtec no longer works for me all it does is make me sleep
 when the fnp says zyrtec doesnut make you sleepy little does she know ium sensitive af uddude0udeudduddude
 afrin for emergencies like not being able to sleep and flonase for long termnni prefer zyrtec for maintenance and benadryl for emergencies but you don't want more pills p
 just popped a zyrtec   benadryl pills ima be sleep soon uddude0
 zyrtec got me fucked up i took that shit at am yesterday and ium still sleepy
 zyrtec is the only antihistamine i can take during the day nothing else is effective nbenadryl does a great job at putting me to sleep uddude0
 i tried getting off zyrtec multiple times about  years ago and i caved after a few days of just misery like it itches so deep in your soul can't sleep really bad i didn't even need it any more because i moved away from the cat i was taking it for but i stayed on it
 maybe you're having a reaction to the bug spray take an antihistamine for about three days and see if it gets better allegra is good and doesn't make you sleepy claritin and zyrtec don't have much impact on most people  not worth the trouble
 anybody use an allergy medicine that you swear by? i'm sick (no pun intended) of losing sleep and having middle of the nightmorning allergy attacks all the time nni usually use zyrtec but it hasn't been working all that great lately
 i wish i could take allergy medications my sinuses are killing me and i have bad reactions to zyrtec claritin allegra and flonase benadryl helps but i have stats work today can't be falling asleep while doing these readings
 fresh udeuddb  zyrtec  hot uddudebfnmay me sleep well tonight (

 kids get sleepy after zyrtec right? right?  nope not my boy  not at all quite the opposite actually this kid looks like he's had my usual daily intake of coffee
 i fell asleep without taking my zyrtec last night and i canut take it in the am so iuve been suffering
  forum  diamine oxidase deficiency in untreated celiac patients live does the h make you sleepy? why not some of the newer antihistamines (like zyrtec) that aren't so sedative? do they not have the same beneficial effect foru

 take a zzzz uddudezyrtec  my hay fever is soo bad here in perth iuve been taking zyrtec ( may make you drowsy ) and sleeping soundly
 iull take this whole bottle of zyrtec and end it all just so i can sleep
 i just started taking montelukast and not only am i falling asleep more easily (an issue zyrtec didn't address at all) but i am sleeping more deeply i wake up just before my alarm feeling like i've been sleeping hours past my alarm and i'm less groggy
 a few years later i started taking zyrtec for mcas and found it made me sleep more soundly if i woke up i'd fall back asleep quickly and i'd usually sleep all the way til my alarm hurray but i'd be groggy for the first hour or two of being awake
 any sorta coffee wouldnut help zyrtec pills keep you sleepy for possibly two days
 and i take zyrtec every daytake benadryl before bed to tame itchiness and help you sleep
 shouldnut gave taken that zyrtec d before bed the sudafed is messing with my sleep uddudeb
 i can only take half a zyrtec or i become so tired i can't keep my eyes open so what do i do last night at pm?? i take  generic allergy pills bcuz that's what the directions say not thinking about how sleepy it makes me even into the next day so now im super gluing my eyes open
 i just dumped my sleeping pills because i thought i didnut need them now ium taking zyrtec to help me sleep
 none of my doctors thought of the fact that zyrtec might be making my sleep disorder worse read your post about zyrtec and the replies and have since stopped taking it crowd sourced health care for the win uddudcdudcudffbuddudcdudcudffbuddudcdudcudffbuddudcdudcudffbuddudcdudcudffbuddudcdudcudffbuddudcdudcudffb
 that zyrtec had me sleeping good as shit
 i am allergic to cats but i let them sleep in my bed and i take zyrtec every day
 im finna sleep absolutely so good because this zyrtec finna hit any minute
 that's super annoying i mostly take zyrtec or claritin for my allergies and those don't make me sleepy
 oh my sweet summer child i take claritin just to breathe half the year you want me to breathe near a cat i'm going to need heavier stuffnnzyrtec works great against cat dander unless i take it more than one day in a row then i'll be just be asleep all through the nd day
 allegra is wayyy better also zyrtec claritin does nothing but make me sleepy
 apologies to everyone i have just been in a really grumpy mood all week i have been having headaches every day for a week think it is sinus pressure from allergies amp; advil is only partially helping can't do the zyrtec my doctor recommended because it makes me too sleepy
 so nnzyrtec makes me sleepynzyrtecd does not make me sleepynni know this now 
 feeling sleepy after taking benadryl is completely normal have you tried taking a nondrowsy antihistamine like allegra or xyzal?
 speaking of allergies i tried xyzal for the first time the other week when i had some hellacious allergies and it seems to be doing a pretty good job makes you sleepy though did not expect that gonna be hunting for the generic next time we're out
 so i've had to take a few benadryl the past few days due to allergy attacks decided to swap out my usual daily allergy med for a beefier onennnever tried xyzal but apparently it also makes you very sleepy i took one an hour or so after i took half a benadryl oh boy i regret
 that zyrtec just gave me the best sleep iuve had all week uddude0duddudecudcudffe
 i finally got enough sleep  guess it was the zyrtec that i'm taking  i not complaining
 thank you for allowing me to get a full night sleep allergiessuck
 im so sleepy i went to grab the cheese and put it back in the fridge and grabbed zyrtec instead
 i feel like utter shit i have a zyrtec d tablet in me that i took at pm i have been properly caffeinated and hydrated and i wish i can just sleep for longer than  hours without wanting my head just to imploded in itself and kill me already 
 have petroleum jellyud my face taken zyrtec and ibuprofen waiting for sleep
 well they are technically both in the same category (antihistimines) so they can play off of each other and up the potential side effects benedryl is generally fine on its own but it tends to make people sleepyout of it so thatus why i recommend like zyrtec or allegra instead
 even taking benadryl in early evening disrupts my sleep quality too much switching to cetirizine (generic zyrtec) twice a day i already take it at night for my allergies so i know it doesn't interfere with my sleep quality now hoping it helps my bladder too
 benadryl just puts them to sleep i use zyrtec; schnazuer's are notorious for having skin allergies  hope you find the trigger
 popped a zyrtec and made my concoction ium going back to sleep
 i need some zyrtec i get the best sleep with that
 abort zyrtec man major mood issue at wakeup  shook it off by noon trying half a benedryl should help with sleeping 
 oh no way?? i take benadryl if theyure really bad and itchy i get splotchy face and whatnot but zyrtec sends me to sleep uddude0 iuve never found out whatus the cause of mine
 i took zyrtec last night for the first time in like a year and i hate ittttr omg it makes me so sleepy for the entire day i could barely wake up for work and ium falling asleep on my lunch break
 zyrtec if you keep it in your home it then becomes a health remedy you'll be sleepy when you first start taking it but after you normally get acclimated
 so did i but apparently some of their formulas donut i also use equate sometimes though which is an off brand zyrtec so that might be what makes me sleepynoh wow skfjfjd
 zyrtec literally makes me collapse with tiredness djfjfjfjgn i always take it at night when i have allergies bc it also helps me sleep as well as get rid of my allergies
 okay i think the zyrtec is kicking in bc i know longer feel like im gonna stop breathing and cough to death so i guess im gonna try and fall asleep again lmfao
 ah weure at peak inability to fall asleep when i forget my medstook my zyrtec tho but itus not kicking in yet so im extra struggling
 i do it does not make me drowsy i prefer zyrtec but my sleep doctor made my switch womp womp
 try zyrtec if that doesnut work benadryl at least you will get a good nights sleep
 this zyrtec was supposed to put me to sleep yet ium wide awake how dat work
 bro get zyrtec and this nasal spray called sensimist or take a benadryl sleep or a shower always helps me
 thatus a bargainnwhatus the generic version of zyrtec and do they make you sleepy?
 i can't take zyrtec with my sleep meds im sad
 so far getting through the day has been a total struggle made the mistake last night of taking a homeopathic sleep aide with zyrtec i have been feeling sleepy in a fog amp; impatient  not a good trifecta (
 i totally understand that i was just trying to suggest something since you said you needed to sleep good luck i'd still try the zyrtec it might not be as bad as benadryl
 you might be better off with benadryl or zyrtec if you are looking for a good night's sleep
 since i came back all iuve been doing is taking zyrtec amp; sleeping to avoid this inevitable headache
 i avoided taking allergy meds for a long time because i assumed they would all make me as sleepy as benadryl does but the second and third gen antihistamines really are better i like zyrteccetirizine which makes me a little sleepy if i take it during the day but not as much
 verdict on alternatives i've tried so far xysal is effective but doubles as a strong sleeping pill; zyrtec doesn't work at all i already know claritin is useless what next?
 great advice i've just been vigilant on washing my hands and taking my zyrtec i've been told i will develop resistance to my own pet i will also vaccum frequently which will help in hs at a sleepover my friend had a long hair siamese in her room and never vacuumed  udeudduddudeudeudduddude
 iuve been sleeping to damn good the past  nights i may need to cut my zyrtec dose in half tonight udeudduddudeuddude0
 oh my god i thought i was going crazy  i've been on zyrtec for a few months now and i really wanna stop however when i do i itch all over like crazy  apparently there's a zyrtec withdrawal symptom waaah i have a hard time sleeping at night sometimes haaalp udduded
 remember that time i couldnut sleep because i kept sneezingsniffling so i took one() zyrtec and knocked tf outnnyesterday was a good day
 does zyrtec help you sleep a little better?
 nasal spray is awful but it can help depending on how long you've been taking claritin you may have built up an immunity switching to a different antihistamine like zyrtec or something usually fixes it or just take benadryl and go to sleep for awhile
 i use a neti pot and sleep w risers under the top of my bed only and i take one chloetab a day along w a zyrtec i also put vaseline in my nose before bed itus a process and thatus my solution
 my allergies were the reason why i didnut sleep well last night uddude but i just took some zyrtec so hopefully iull feel better in a minute
 see if you have another antihistamine or grab one over the counter from a drug store such as cetirizine (zyrtec) loratadine (claritin) or fexofenadine (allegra) these shouldn't make you sleepy
 my aunt zyrtec doesnut make you sleepynnme after sleeping  hours 
 maybe? most antihistamines keep me awake for hours though nn(i used to take  mg of benadryl to stay awake during law school lectures i like zyrtec because it doesn't interfere with my sleep)
 this is what i like to call uc i donut know whatus causing my  day headache cocktailudntylenol ibuprofen coffee zyrtec and sleep will keep you updated on the results
 i googled it and i should be fine though i took a childrenus zyrtec (accidentally) a few hours ago i guess iull just try and sleep and wake up then take this med and hope it works fast you know if i donut miraculously wake up healthy
 woke up after  hours of sleep this morning with a red eye think one of teddy's hairs might have gotten in my eye took zyrtec used allergy eye drops still swollen need more sleep it seems
 so ium not sure if ium getting sick or if it really is allergies i take nyquil at night so i can sleep and idk if should take zyrtec during the day i just want this cough to go away
 told him no bc he needs to take a zyrtec and sleep uddudc
 so don't do zyrtecd before you go to sleep unless you aren't really trying to go to sleep
 does your wife have mast cell problems or histamine intolerance?  histamine naturally goes up in the evening  it can cause insomnia in those of us that are sensitive iuve had terrible sleep problems for  years that resolved when taking xyzal at night

 an apple a day keeps the doctor away and taking xyzal at night will give you allergy relief while you sleep u and all the next day learn more about the latest in allergy relief here  
 i take cetirizine (generic zyrtec) for allergies and it doesn't seem to make me sleepier but i have heard it makes other people tired someone else recommended a combo of xyzal and nasacort but i don't like steroids however it has worked for me in the past i prefer nasalcrom
 i feel this pain between my allergies and my ra plus my ra related skin rashes i feel like death through spring and fall (though they're my favorite seasons) i have to switch up meds frequently cause they lose their effectiveness xyzal works great but it made me too sleepy

 xyzal it's an allergy med but nthe only side effect is great sleep
 iuve never taken claritin i switch between zyrtec amp; allegra zyrtec makes me sleepy allegra doesnut then i also take flonase but saline m nasal spray works good for me too
 zyrtec makes me sleepy but works amazing also  claritin works good too

 nah they help  just not as much as we'd like gotta find the right one med tech said claritin stopped working for her zyrtec's the only one that doesn't totally knock me out apparently flonase helps me sleep much better at night lowered my daily coffee consumption
 how to tell your sneezing fit is from cold not allergies  wake up to sneezing fit take double dose of zyrtec try to go back to sleep take a third zyrtec finally go back to sleep wake up to sneezing fit sneezingfit
 ragweed's the bane of my existence may i make a suggestion? dose yourself wflonase at night (an hour or so before you go to sleep) amp; either claritin  zyrtec or allegra in the morning
 i use generic zyrtec (cetirizine) and any allergy relief eye drops fun fact histamines play a major role in the sleepwake cycle which is why most allergy meds cause drowsiness benadryl allegra and zyrtec are antihistamines claritin and pseudoephedrine are decongestants
 so i was having a dream about horses last night and my subconscious kept telling me you didnt take a zyrtec this morning so you're gonna sneeze up a storm so i woke up took a zyrtec and tried to go back to sleep to finish my horse dream sneeze free i hate my sleepy self

 i've tried both i couldn't sleep at all on zyrtec but it's the first newer generation antihistamine that worked for me aside from exacerbating my already terrible sleep issues
 i've taken  at a time fairly often with no i'll effects it can cause paranoia and hallucinations in high doses but typically happens after mg depending on your sizetolerance generally it just makes you sleep try a combo of zyrtec and claritin it'll last longer
 i fell asleep by the start of the second quarter it was better than melatonin benadryl and zyrtec combined
 i wonder if ca has different regulations or if zyrtec has diff ingredients? does zyrtec work exactly the same as claritind? i wanted the one with the pseudoephedrine in it because all the regular allergy medicine puts me straight to sleep even nondrowsy 
 just up watching ry sleep his cough is horrid uddude i guess the zyrtec didn't work uddude
 i remember taking zyrtec in my teens it always made me super sleepy on the other hand couldn't even sleep during the night due to not being able to breath properly

 have been extremely itchy to the point of not being able to sleep the last couple of days realized it is almost certainly being caused by zyrtec (antihistamine) withdrawal took my last pill  days ago beware
 i donut know whether to blame the late night or the zyrtec for still being sleepy but itus one of them and i donut want to function because of it uddude0uddude
 oh i'm the minority with zyrtec where it makes me sleepy
 okk i do have some meds i can recommend zyrtec helps with constant sneezing when i have it or benadryl (but htat makes you sleepy unless you take half) if the allergic reaction is due to the season it cant be helped but it passes by bringing tissues around for runny noses
 well i guess zyrtec makes me sleepy nowliterally dozed off a few times in history class

 letus play do i have corona? or do i have seasonal allergies and anxiety? survey says the pollen count is  out of  take a zyrtec and go to sleep
 i didnut like zyrtec it would knock me tf out and iud have hallucinationesc dreams where i couldnut tell if i was awake or asleep i like claritin the best for allergies itus non drowsy benedryl is fine but makes you tired too
 just took a zyrtec maybe now i can sleep
 i need this zyrtec to get my allergies under control so i can sleep peacefully
 i've had it since middle school taking zyrtec helps gotosleep when your body is tired no matter what if you wake up in the middle of the night try not to use your phone keep your eyes closed as much as possible it'll help you fall back asleep faster and not mess up your cycle
 zyrtec is what i take daily only taking benadryl to see if it will help me sleep so far it hasn't helped  dana i'll check for you here and i'll let you know what i find
 hi thanks for sharing i took zyrtec for my allergy too but not daily because i always feel drowsy the next day i used to take it for sleep back then until i have to get some help now i take it only if i have to
 yeah given that the zyrtec and a good night's sleep helped significantly i think i'm good  )
 zyrtec is the one that makes me sleepy  allegra changed my life  it's so weird how different ones work for everyone  my mom swears by singulair
 for some reason allegra makes me sleepy a few hours after i take it i can't stay awake and i'm not usually a napper it works but i need to be awake and zyrtec makes me hungry i suddenly become a snacker it's weird i don't hear of them affecting anyone else like this
 allergies are killing me had to pop a benadryl even though ium already on a  hour zyrtec i hate taking so much but i need to be able to sleep tonight hopefully
 that sucks ) the only good thing about benadryl is that it works really fast but try cetirizine or zyrtec they work exactly the same and they do not make you sleepy theyure just more expensive
 well i donut know about you but that shit makes me sleepy as hell thatus why i always take zyrtec
 being awake is pointless so i wanna take zyrtec and sleep
 my flonase just caused it to get worse i take zyrtec and use the humidifier and can actually now sleep through the nite headache is gone and so is the mucus i have a dry cough now sometimes
 took my last zyrtec d this am got plenty of the sleepytime antihistamines
 and i am all out of zyrtec  time for some benadryl and a good nights sleep
 i also had that feeling at times i tried zyrtec liquid for kids since it was recommended to me for sleeping
 ah yes allergies season nthis zyrtec has me sleeping the whole day away but at least ium not suffering and scaring myself into covid  self diagnosing
 i use zyrtec in the morning and benadryl at night i get so sleepy from it
 i feel like the one time i tried zyrtec it made me sleepy so i stopped trying it
 omg iiiii know can't take zyrtec cuz it makes me sleepy but i have back ups for my  not messin around with these allergies ugh
 realy bad sinus headache but zyrtec fixed it enough i could sleep

 does zyrtec make yuall sleepy??
 if you can try zyrtec if you can deal with being sleepy try benadryl
 god knewsent home popped my zyrtec amp; off to sleep uddude
 equate zyrtec and if still needed equate childrenus chewable benedryl as neededdoesnt make you sleepy like adult dose
 zyrtec and benadryl are helping a lot benadryl works better than anything else (for me) but i am so sleepy after i take it guess i'll pick my battles hope y'all are okay
 i think ium getting hives but i left my zyrtec at college and if i take a benadryl iull take a nap which means i wouldnut sleep tonight so thatus how my life is going
 i took a zyrtec yesterday and this morning  and same situation i'm sleepy as hell tho
 i have zyrtec too i take that at night since it makes me sleepy

 i've been on a doubledose of zyrtec just to sleep through the night
 ask your student center if they have any generic zyrtec  won't make you sleepy
 which one did you take? benadryl is know to cause intense dreams zyrtec is a a little milder claritin is my preferred to sleep with little negative impacts
 ok so my allergies flared up in my sleep ium officially taking my zyrtec daily the pollen is here
 zyrtec worked for me for a long time close to  years i started taking zxyal  years ago i also took the former at night because it made me sleepy amp; also actually worked for me during the day the latter is designed to be taken at night
 i know that feeling i took a zyrtec d last night because i was so congested i couldnut breathe it helped me sleep a little bit better

 try zyrtec itus one of the best or use benadryl it will make you sleep you should feel better when you wake
 or allegra if zyrtec makes you sleepy

 does zyrtec make you sleepy ?
 this should do the trick  google it so you can show the pharmacy in case it's not bought there as often  i have allergies  and take zyrtec d which my doctor says the d doesn't make u sleepy  the allerchlor works well for my sons with seasonal allergies
 i think zyrtec is stronger most people say it makes them sleepy but i take mine in the morning and never have gotten sleepy from it i took claritin for  years before switching to zyrtec
 zyrtec works faster and has a slight sedation to it claritin works slower and is sleepy free but both last hrs and do the same thing really from experience neither works better just the sleepy thing is important to know
 imma be sleep in a minute i made me a hot toddy and took a zyrtec

 i had to switch from zyrtec two years ago; it just stopped doing anything for me ngood luck with the not falling asleep uddude00
 i just took some zyrtec i think i'll be okay but i also might fall asleep
 anecdotal  but i will swear by xyzal zyrtec puts me to sleep have also had experience with allegra claritin clarinex fluticasone azelastine benadryl seldane immunotherapy opcon a
 once i wake up from this zyrtec i will do something more productive than sleeping
 exactly i like claritin amp; zyrtec thatus the only thing that works and donut make me sleepy
 claritin worked for me for years but then i had to switch to zyrtec after awhile your body gains a resistance and you have to change it up bonus if you had motion sickness or fall asleep from nonnarco medications neither of those will be a problem anymore after a while 
  flonase  sprays twice a day for peak symptoms  anti histamines thst work in order or effectiveness xyzalgt;zyrtecgt;allegraclaritin you can take  bid but know in  of pts they get sleepy with more than  a day (usually itus women)
 it takes me down if i can tell itus been a bad allergy day iull take one at night instead of zyrtec and i sleep like a baby
 i use xyxal which is supposed to be  hrs but have been needing to take benadryl to sleep and zyrtec d during the day as well
 forgot i took a generic zyrtec amp; i had a glass of  wine udeudd im sleepy
 i take zyrtec because most other allergy medicine makes me sleepy
 zyrtec make yuall sleepy or nah?
 the doctor said to try baby zyrtec but didnut find it amusing when i said ucohhhhhh okayyyyud after she said it would make him sleepy udduded mauam please do not judge me i have been sleep deprived for the last  months this will kill  birds with  stone if it helps uddudeb
 ium dead tired if i take meds during the day and have had that issue before i take them at night if my allergies are bad helps me sleep and i wake up and can make it through the day (zyrtec) pretty well however i havenut seen much of outside soooo ium pretty good now haha
 taking zyrtec at night to treat my hives has done nothing to help my hives but holy fuck itus making me very tired and i am almost sleeping through the night without a ptsd nightmare
 i think i had it in feb  we have a lot of travel in this area  i was off for  weeks  it was weird  i have had the flu a lot but this one i knew exactly who and when i got it  the exact moment for a second i thought i couldnut breath a deep sleep and took zyrtec d 
 zyrtec is the only allergy that works for me but it will have me sleep in 0 seconds udeudd
 just took a fake zyrtec so ima suddenly end up sleep out of nowhere im quite sure
 damn and here i am taking zyrtec ium trying to go to sleep
 thank you very much lynn appreciate it hope you are doing well i bought a generic one of allegra and claritin because this crazy zyrtec made me feel like i was taking sleeping pills ) hopefully the others will work )
 good morning everyone been dealing with allergy coughs and congestion fun fun fun took some zyrtec yesterday never should have because that stuff puts me to sleep canut wait to try something different wonder if anyone else falls asleep with allergy medicine? lol
 itus because youure lying down so your sinuses go all funky because theyure compromised from allergies or whatever so itus best to sleep with your head slightly elevated udeudd  also if you can take an allergy med like zyrtec
 try zyrtec at bedtime then the  hour dose's sleep inducing property becomes a feature not a bug also you might try taking mucinex er  x a day  it'll help your sinuses by cutting down the postnasal drip
 i got the joy of going through all of them last year for efficacy testing the only ones effective for me were zyrtec (longestlasting) and allegra (fastest) benadryl works in the sense of putting me to sleep and leaving me feeling like i was hit by a truck the next day
 benedryl may work but i'll never know because even a children's dose knocks me to the floornnthe zyrtec does work for me once i've taken it for a few days in a row it makes me sleepy at first too so i take  at night
 zyrtec works better than benadryl for me but only if i take it every night and i still have to take it at night because while it's not as sleepinducing as benadryl it still makes me sleepy
 i was amused to discover the agent in benadryl (diphenhydramine) is literally the sole ingredient in most over the counter sleep aids nni use benadryl to sleep and zyrtec for my allergies
 my allergies just woke me up out of my sleep eyes looking puffy afuddude had to pop a zyrtec shit is crazy
 my zyrtec is kicking in along with this rain ium getting sleepy
 she said it just made sense so she took it and it was zyrtec d she also took tylenol pm because she was so terrified she couldnut sleep
 zyrtec gives me sleep apnea so i canut even take the shit while my anxiety is bad shit feel like you dying with your eyes open amp;amp; canut move but my allergies bad too fml
 zyrtec babe itull handle that issue and not make u sleep all day uddudcb
 i got some medicine that actually helps with my headaches  zyrtec  only bad thing is i've been more sleepy than normal  (
 let me let him go to sleepnnmy silly is on a hunned thanks to this zyrtec nnuddude0uddude0udeudd
 benadryl is waaaayyyy worse they use that in hospitals to make you sleepy zyrtec will make you sleepy but like you need a cup of coffee and youull be fine kind of sleepy until you get used to it and then you wonut even notice
 some people combine it with a h allergy pill i can take two generic zyrtec without getting sleepy and they appear to help me deescalate the hypervigilance good luck
 i have allergies and take both zyrtec and allegra (yeah i know my allergist ordered) it can make you sleepy if you arenut used to it but itus been in my system for idk  years now and just on itus own itus fine with allegra and another zombie med i take different story
 next time try aerius my fav or if u like claritin take nondrowsyzyrtec makes me sleep for hrs nonstop
 just found out zyrtec works best for my allergies but my lungs still feel a bit heavy when i sleep
 let's hope for the best get lots of sleep and take an antihistamine like zyrtec or allegra every day for a while to rule this out get well soon
 it was just constant hacking before i went on it i couldn't breathe or eat or sleep or talk or live without wheezing my lungs straight out of my facehole it takes singulair zyrtec benadryl symbicort and an albuterol inhaler to keep me oxygenated
 during allergy season i take allegra  hr x a day (allergist said itus ok to double up) sudafed  hr in the am and flonase in the am good lucknnallergist said claritin doesnut do anything so iud avoid that one zyrtec makes me sleepy so better to take at night
 i'll have to get something i remember taking zyrtec waaaay back when it was prescription only and it didn't work at all and yeah my sleep has gotten worse lately hope yours gets better though
 the sleep shit is relatable been sleepin god awful since the quarantine maybe take a zyrtec? that medicine seems to work well for allergies if you can get some tomorrow or somethin
 the previous  full length novels i have read were huge letdown so very nice to be reading a book series that is difficult to get my nose out of but i need serious sleep zyrtec is kinda kicking my ass the last few days
 it does smell uddude0 i put it on at night and try to just fall asleep quick uddude0 i really like zyrtec benadryl makes me sleepy and i never have that problem with zyrtec
 so apparently zyrtec gives me thestuffwhere you sleep all the time and thething where you can't remember and that other thing when you can'tuhhh
 no such luck here everytime i take an allergy medicine i get sleepy zyrtec specifically
 ium overly paranoid now with my allergy symptoms but since thereus nowhere to go ium just taking all the benadryl and zyrtec and sleeping
 ceterizine is zyrtecn i get  for  at sam's club ni take it at night so it helps me sleep as a bonus uddudcd
 taking zyrtec  sudafed  vickus sinex severe spray  pure gold allergy relief i can breathe i can sleep i am alive again
 zyrtec make me sleepy everytime uddude
 ayyyyy adult onset allergiesit hits when you donut expect it i had a similar experience as well best thing to do is find a otc allergy med that works good for you zyrtec works for me but makes me sleepy so i take it before bed time to deep clean your area
 benadryl is good but makes you sleepy i would try zyrtec make sure to take them before youure exposed to the allergen )
 definitely sleep better taking zyrtec at night vs in the morning
 why did i take this zyrtec udeuddudcudfffuduufe0f ium back sleepy now
 yea i forgot i had nasal spray but zyrtec puts me to sleep lol
 that is the truth  you sneeze or cough in public and people scatter  zyrtec in the day and benadryl at night or the generic stuff  benadryl kinda helps to get to sleep
 if itus traveling like that you might want to stay on something for a couple days claritin doesnut work for me but either that or zyrtec wonut make you as sleepy as benadryl my regime per dr is creme and an antihistamine only benadryl and prednisone if it goes anaphylactic
 zyrtec makes me so sleepy  got this day time medicine but you can only take  every hours and it only works for like  of those hoursudduded
  do not recommend the experience i managed to outsleep the worst of the symptoms by putting myself in a near comatose state with a lot of zyrtec
 zyrtec better benadryl makes u drowsy as fuck unless u wanna sleep lol amp; they have reiki music for allergies sounds crazy but it lowkey works 
 day  someone i live with had a fever for a couple days so we went to get tested due to the cost we only got one test since we live together weud have the same resultnthat night a mild sore throat started took zyrtec (thought it was allergies) amp; fell asleep by am
 i love taking benadryl on top of flonase and zyrtec and singulair especially since i react weirdly and get insomnia instead of sleepiness
 ive dealt w it all my life and all they do is offer prescription zyrtec and it is expensive so im just fuckt i usually take  pills but it doesnt work for hours n i get super sleepy
 mickey allergies have be the worse heus sneezing all night i have him zyrtec and he is now sound asleep snoring uddude
 zyrtec just put me to sleep for  hours omg
 when you are up since am with allergies amp; give up on trying to sleep canut find the zyrtec so you just decide to wrap yourself in multiple blankets on the couch and watch living single someone stop the pollen 
 i need zyrtec i think ium allergic to sleep
 zyrtec take it at night even tho it says nondrowsy it will help you sleep wash your hair at night pollen sticks to your hair then comes off on your pillow wash pillow cases in hot water nose spray in the morning flonase or nasonex keep your windows closed good luck
 take a zyrtec everyday just so i donut have the anxiety over whether i have allergies or corona control what you can control when everything is out of control sleep better too uddude0f
 zyrtec  benadryl a shot of apple cider vinegar and melatonin sleep bath later still hurt uddude
 we live on zyrtec   never makes us sleepy  but if it does for some reason thereus also zyrtec d (has a decongestant in it) that helps
 i had 0 caffeine today i took  nyquil pills  zyrtec  extra strength musinex and  extra strength melatonin pills if i dont sleep tonight im calling the police bc wtf 
 i have to take benadryl sleep aid and zyrtec everyday  sleep be magnificent at night uddude0 
 first day at work was okay but back to stayhome tomorrow also i got an allergic reaction at work prolly all the dusty stuffs now ium all sleepy thanks to zyrtec
  forum  melatonin benadryl benadryl does cross the blood brain barrier (why it can make you sleepy) and some recent studies say this can lead to some serious side effects consider an antihistamine like zyrtec or claritin thatu 
 weren't you talking about sleeping so much?  zyrtec might be why it's number  side effect is sleepiness and why i don't take it xp  but it's also a super heavy hitter antihistamine so if anything is going to take care of an allergy it will
 youuve talked about insomnia too i take zyrtecd everyday for my allergies this time of year but i donut take it at night because it keeps me awake  i take benadryl at night instead maybe thatull help you get some sleep )
 xyzal take a half pill at nightmakes you a little sleepy
 going to take a claritin rn and it should kick in sometimes next week xyzal makes me sleepy
 had to go to sleep with xyzal n benadryl n had vitamin c with eye drop for the pollen in my neighborhood so i fill u
 xyzal pills for miskito bits but makes u sleep like a baby as a side effect which is needed these days udduded
 wonderful to hear mandy remember take xyzal at night for relief while you sleep and all the next day too
 i use to use flonase and a  hour claritin but stopped the flonase a while back maybe i need to try it again how do you feel about xyzal? iuve wanted to try it but i heard it makes people really sleepy
 i didn't know xyzal made you sleepy?? or is it my flu idk omgmgggg had to take a power nap
 i only take xyzal when i know ium not going anywhere early in the morning that joint will clear you right up and have you on your ass youull have the absolute best sleep sleepbreak
 thatus so interesting xyzal mg is my personal favorite but benadryl and zyrtec make me fall asleep right away
 my preferred antihistamine is xyzal (levocetirizine) if zyrtec (cetirizine) works for you but makes you sleepy try it insteadnncaution if you take either of these long term discontinuing can make you intensely itchynnclaritin (loratadine) is easier to stop but dry mouth uddude
 wanting to watch the second star wars but knowing i just took this xyzal for my allergies and will probably fall asleep halfway through and thatus just disrespectful
 this zyrtec finna have me sleepy as hell
 i only fell asleep after a zyrtec and two benadryl and i only got five hours
 for those who are furiously itchy even after taking a zyrtecdrugstore antihistamine is there anything else that helps? or should i go to the doctor for something more hefty uddude ium itching myself constantly to the point i bleed from the minute i wake up to right before i sleep
 zyrtec is what i took today honestly my body can't even handle medication everything makes me so drowsy and sleepy
 loratadine (claritin) is cheaper but cetirizine (zyrtec) is more effective warning zyrtec can make you sleepy if you're not used to it
 yes allerclear works great although it doesn't always last the full  hours  i stopped taking zyrtec and switched to allerclear several years ago and haven't needed to take anything else  allerclear doesn't make me sleepy or speedy  it has no effect as far as i can tell
 zyrtec or clearitin drink orange juice rub some vickus vapor rub before you sleep
 need to stop trying to use zyrtec to sleep
 yea nasal spray doesnut do much for me either (ni take allegra everyday bc i also have seasonal allergies but if itus rly bad i also take zyrtec at night (zyrtec makes u sleepi) it takes a while sometimes for both of those to kick in but if u take em everyday it should help
 zyrtecus active ingredient is cetirizine which is a fast acting antihistamine so while drowsiness is a side effect of the medication zyrtec can have a stronger affect on people i canut do anything if i take them they make me brain dead and sleep for hours
 the fact that i have to take a zyrtec in the morning claritin at night use nasacort and eye drops plus sleep under my humidifier daily is sad 
 what do yuall take for allergies ? claritin doesnut work zyrtec is soso only thing that really works is benadryl but it puts me to sleep in  minutes uddude
 hello hi i sat outside for two hours last night and did not sleep due to a sinus headache and now i feel like dirt is in my face and also that i am stonednnthis is after showering taking zyrtec and my pm and am doses of rx nasal spraynnplease just put me in a bubble
 yeah he probably has it bc i used to do that there's lighter versions of it thonnsinuses allergies etc can cause snoring which can restrict airflow and lower oxygen during sleep for some cheap tests you can try a nasal strip some claritinzyrtec and sleeping your side
 not sure why taking childrenus zyrtec at bedtime gives me such numerous and vivid dreams can recall three different parts from the same ongoing dream last night at least this time it didnut trigger sleep paralysis uddudeuddude
 being an essential worker during this covid crap i have had soooo much trouble sleeping tried everything lately esp due to my allergies i take benadryl but better yet zyrtec and bought a cooling pillow i sleep a bit more but still struggle
 i canut sleep w my dog omfg sheus making my allergies act up so bad i have taken two zyrtec (accidentally because i forgot i already took one) today and i can still barely open my eyes
 took some zyrtec at  am and went back to sleep
 why ain't the zyrtec kickin in it's been an hour fucker i can't sleep like this aghhhhh
 i should just take a zyrtec cuz once i'm sleep i'm not tryna wake up and take one
 oh wait i just had benadryl because i started breaking out into hives because i forgot to restock on my zyrtecnnno i donut know why ium like thisnni go sleep now
 since i had so much trouble going to sleep last night ium finna pop a benadryl or zyrtec which one shall it beuddude?
 so much worse at night  it's like trying to sleep while elves cram tiny cotton balls up your noseni use zyrtec but have switched to zyrtecd    i think claritin makes one with the extra decongestant  it helps
 awnmay i ask does allegrad work for you? we've tried flonase but experienced joint pain and dry mouth as side effects but it was the only one that didn't make me sleepy i've tried claratin zyrtec and prescription meds yet to try allegrad and zyzol?
 we got a on zyrtec for her allergies and holy shit the difference in her sleep is insane she doesnut wake up to rub her eyes constantly so she only woke up twice last night rather than every  min
 i can always count on zyrtec for dead to the world sleep problem is that it kicks in about  hours too late
 take the zyrtec before you go to sleep 
 yeah itus horrible i hope it passes soonnnare you able to sleep? i get a little relief when i fall asleep for a bit but thatus it zyrtec ainut hitting this like it used to uddude
 haven't been sleeping well amp; been trying  melatonin but it didn't work ( is recommended) took  last night and a zyrtec as was getting hives around bedtime put me into sleep coma until i woke up restless around am then went back into sleep coma til  thumbs up?
 i had the worst headache yesterday but i was convinced that it was allergies so i took a zyrtec and went to sleep i slept the best nights sleep i have slept all quarantine and woke up with no headache little victories u
 of course the one time i decide to take zyrtec for allergies i oversleep my alarms and have to be called into an ard yikes uddudecudduded nnbut thatus not going to ruin my wednesday itus turning around right now claiming it
 i wish you the best of luck and will be following this i take claritin daily the doctor tried to also put me on flonase and on zyrtec zyrtec (possibly because it combined with the claritin) made me so sleepy and flonase was giving me nosebleeds i need help with sinus too
 i thought zyrtec was non drowsy? benadryl's my sleep drug of choice
 uses zyrtec as a sleep aid
 donut know if i wanna take benadryl or zyrtec might as well get a good night sleep
 oh definitely so many naps  almost narcolepticuddude0uddude0uddude0 allergies generally make me sleepy  i get super itchy eyes and it's just nice to close them i take zyrtec if it gets really bad but usually i can deal with
 i can understand that i had some irritation and started to check related symptoms my chest fest heavy over the weekend so i went back to sleep after talking the zyrtec it has us all questioning
 yes nasonex zyrtec and mucinex d definitely route of choice with both ozone and molds upnnalso dustproof covers on bedding changing air filters in hvac and not allowing pets on where you sleep and sit also helps
 oh my goodness we fell back asleep i took a zyrtec yesterday and i've been tired ever since no more of those i'll just keep my allergy
 alexander takes zyrtec daily n it's not working right now doesn't the benadryl make you sleepy?
 i took a shower today just so i would feel normal felt like garbage getting up today went to bed at  wstomach ache woke up at  with massive allergies amp; anxietyudduded note to self sleep wwindows closed have zyrtec amp; klonopin next to beduddudenhope you get some oomph  udeuddeudcudffb
 i have to put air in my tires get more zyrtec amp; zquil deposit checks and mail my postcards i am not happy about it i want to remain safe inside my covidfree cave sleeping preferably 
 zyrtec is just sleeping pills right? don't need to worry about allergies when you're fast asleep within the hour
 there must be a method to put this minions to sleep without me shouting and no itus not gonna happen routine was perfect until cb covid came about and now they sleep later and later ium so close to give them zyrtec
 i take it at night but its likei gotta time it right or i wake up groggy i'm hitting cvs tomorrow morning to get either zyrtec or claritin i am suffering and im sick of only being able to sleep this shit pissing me off lmao
 so i didnut go to sleep till  and my nieces came over at  because i have to babysit right? ium dying from allergies so i took a zyrtec and i ended up falling back asleep i woke up to a phone call was delusional
 i take zyrtec for minor allergies but a couple of days last week and earlier this week they were so bad i was taking benadryl to get to sleep
 my mom took a good look at me (while i was talking) interrupted me and asked if i wanted a zyrtec (so i can go to sleep quicker) nnlol nselling her on ebay if anyoneus interested
 zyrtec makes me sleepy udeudd
 zyrtec makes me sleepwalk someone told me to try local honey that contains some of the pollen molecules but god knows if that's just bullshit or what
 apparently the active ingredient in zyrtec isn't supposed to make you sleepy but it still can udeudd i am just a wuss ig lmao
 whatus a good allergy medicine that doesnut make you sleepy? zyrtec be having me soo tired
 i take zyrtec daily too and benedryl if it gets toooo bad but that makes me so sleepy
 try some zyrtec tonight i have bad insomnia for  years that keeps me asleep
 i swear by zyrtec fwiw much more effective than claritin doesn't make me sleepy
 zyrtec be puttin you to sleep? cause i been using it for two years and never any drowsiness i was taking claritin before i switched but the claritin didnt seem to last the full day for me
 last night i learned just how much my hour zyrtec helps me sleep i woke at  am and thatus after i had a workout glad i can start taking it again wednesday night til then iull be on autopilot 
 yeah i tend to sleep better when i take daily antihistamines either zyrtec or telfast sleep quality is better unclear as to why because they don't make me drowsy
 zyrtec makes me sleepy but other antihistamines donut discovered that when i took it at work because it was labelled a non drowsy antihistamine udeudd
 i've gotten fewer since switching from allegra to zyrtec also regulating my sleep schedule so that i go to bed earlier and also wake up earlier helped a lot still get them occasionally but way less often
 not all antihistamines are the same i can take a benadryl and run around like nothing but taking zyrtec singulair and prilosec all at the same time at night knocks me out (plus i am encouraging them by trying to sleep)nnnow waking up in the morning on the other hand uddude0
 i take my storebrand zyrtec around dinnertime to help prevent my otherwise uncontrollable sneezing fits upon waking i suspect it helps my sleep because of what itus doing for my allergies but i donut notice drowsiness
 maybe it helps you sleep through the night because it's suppressing allergic responses  (maybe lowgrade ones that you haven't been conscious of)nif it is placebo and you can afford the zyrtec udcudfudcudfudcudf
 my understanding is that zyrtec is structurally similar to benedryl  most otc sleeping meds have benedryl as the active ingredient i suspect it is not a placebo effect i know someone who cannot take zyrtec due to the intense sleepiness it causes for him
 zyrtec makes me sleepy udeuddudcudffcuduufe0f
 zyrtec (cetirizine) appears to be improving my sleep hoooooooow do i know if this is a placebo effect? uddude
 zyrtec (makes me sleepy but doesn't have that side effect for everyone) claritin (won't make you sleepy) alka seltzer allergy and sudafed (best for sinus problems)nni'm from the country in the south and i have had seasonal allergies my whole life lol hopefully this helps 
 zyrtec makes me sleepy i took some last night lol
 i can't even enjoy sleeping in on my day off because these allergies are kicking my tailni paid d to help but this fool just sitting in the corner watching uddude
 in the meantime try out the otc med called zyrtec aka cetirizine my gerd sometimes leaks into my lungs when i sleep which triggers a nasty reaction similar to severe pneumonia cetirizine when taken with caffeine reverses this effect in  minutes add zantac for added boost
 trying to figure out why i cannot sleepjust dawned on me i forgot to take my zyrtec allergy med antihistamine knocks me the funk out if i take it now i may sleep all day 
 my work day is almost done so i can take a zyrtec (they make me sleepy) hope youuve got a remedy for yours as well
 gonna try claritin alegra does nothing for me anymore and zyrtec puts me to sleep uddudeudcudffbuduufe0f
 lol you gonna get sleepy try zyrtec itus  hour i take one and one benadryl and am usually good from there
 zyrtec for suuuuuure bruh i keep that shit on me benadryl is a must right before i sleep too udeudd
 i use to take benadrylit made me so sleepyi stopped and switch to zyrtec when it comes to allergies i donut do generic
 every night i take nyquil amp; zyrtec have  waters by my bed and sleep with a humidifier all because of these hoe ass allergies and sinuses uddude
 drew took a zyrtec at  and has now been asleep for over an hour this is what getting old is like for anyone wondering
 oh not me it used to work within  mins but not anymore i have the   and mg they dont worki have been taking our brand sleep aid its just diphenhydramine mgs and  zyrtec for my allergiesi have been getting more sleepn now i get up every hrs not every  hr lol
 this zyrtec d makes it impossible to sleep ium sitting here eating pringleus watching tv like itus mid day i just wanna sleeep 
 my allergies have brought me to my knees today started with the usual burning eyes sneezing then a little tightness in the throat and overall fatigue took  zyrtecus and a benadryl  been trying to sleep through this
 thatus so interesting xyzal mg is my personal favorite but benadryl and zyrtec make me fall asleep right away
 exactly  everyone's body chemistry is unique if i take mg of ibuprofen it makes me sleepy same with zyrteci take half a pill to help me sleep  other ppl take it during the day (for allergy symptoms) and no drowsiness
 bought zyrtec for my allergies n dis shit is ass i usually take benadryl but dem bitches put u to sleep n i b doing shit during da dayudduded
 makes me sleepy zyrtec did nothing ima stick to claritin
 my preferred antihistamine is xyzal (levocetirizine) if zyrtec (cetirizine) works for you but makes you sleepy try it insteadnncaution if you take either of these long term discontinuing can make you intensely itchynnclaritin (loratadine) is easier to stop but dry mouth uddude
 claritin or zyrtec are great choices try it daily  take it at night until you know if it makes you sleepy you can still dose benadryl on top of you have to
 itus zyrtec otc now but it puts me to sleep so i can only take at night when i donut need it i just use patady eye drops which is finally otc also
 zyrtec dont fuckin work uddude all it does is make you sleepy 
 thatus the cure for me usually take a zyrtec or benadryl go to sleep wake up feeling better (but hungover)
 i took two execrdin and a zyrtec just to be able to sleep last night because my allergies hate me
 just started taking zyrtec a couple days ago i'm one of those people who can't function on benadryl too sleepy hoping it helps i really need my chiropractor hopefully he can open up soon
 the sleep after eating zyrtec gt;gt;
 the whole fucking week sucking on zyrtec and whiskey to help me sleep
 after being stoned and sleepy all day yesterday from allergy meds i was crazy productive today maybe i should od on zyrtec more often
 having a little nap i got my zyrtec an hour ago it does always make me a little sleepy but it is working i start to get itchy again pretty much right at the  hour mark and then it goes away when i get my next dose 
 so much worse at night  it's like trying to sleep while elves cram tiny cotton balls up your noseni use zyrtec but have switched to zyrtecd    i think claritin makes one with the extra decongestant  it helps
 i took an walzyr extra strength allergy pill this morning at am after sleeping all night it put me down man like drinking a bottle of nyquil ni passed out for another  hours and still feel sleep drunknwho knew a allergy pill would be a date rape drug for me
 try levocetrizine taken an hour before you wanna go to sleep  it's brand name is xyzal and is now otc
 xyzal i take it before bed so the drowsy part is when ium sleeping anyway when i remember to take out before bed that it is
 today i am on xyzal and zyrtec and nsaids and last night id taken benadryl before sleep and im finally getting phlegm out after  full weeks
 hoarse try xyzal it's fabulous it is an allergy med with a sleep inducer no funky dreams and my sinuses are much better nn(no i don't work for big pharma) nni like to use my voice when a product works as promised
 i definitely took a dose of my nasal spray before bed but i take my xyzal in the morning it's supposed to be  hr but i think that's a lie ni did sleep with the windows open but it's not the first time
 that sounds awesome i didnut sleep well last night except when i was trying to stay up to watch dayfiancebeforethedays frank amp; may are snoozing beside me ium on benadryl amp; xyzal so it makes me really drowsy i did snooze a lot during the day yesterday
 got up at  when the  year old asked for nose medicine (zyrtec) because seasonal allergies then decided it was time to be up fell asleep on the couch while he watched my little pony woke to find my wife a saint had taken over my breakfast and coffee duties
 try this stuff its generic zyrtec and doesnt make you sleep 
 me udeudda i have to use a navage flonase and sometimes nasal decongestant sprays and zyrtec which makes me sleep all day but itus the only thing that works when itus severe 
 took a zyrtec and if i fall asleep then udeuddudcudffeuduufe0f
 zyrtec doesnut work for me just makes me sleepy asf
 my allergies have been killing me today but all i had was an expired zyrtec and then later got nondroswy claritin and long story short i ended up taking both sleeping on and off all day while my kid climbed all over me and wrecked the house and my throat still hurts saturdaze
 thatus been pretty much my strategy zyrtec seems better than allegra but adjusting to the sleepiness side effect makes for slow going i started taking it in the am and accidentally fell asleep at my desk (otoh benedryl doesnut make me noticeably drowsy go figure)
 i fucked up i took zyrtec cause i ran out of allegra and uddudeuddude ium fighting this sleep udeudd
 if i take claritin i can breathe pretty well but i itch if i take allegra i donut itch but my asthma kicks up ium allergic to an ingredient in almost all the other allergy meds and zyrtec is a really good sleeping pill if i want  hrs this wedding situation is a tough one
 is just powering to stay awakenso my dad goofed and left me a bag of goldfish without actually he king the labelnfun fact the flavor blasted ones have garlic zyrtec makes me sleepy amp; i didnut swallow any but my tongue now feels like 
 last night was the best night of sleep in awhile because i wasnut itching thanks to all the creams applied especially the steroid cream also zyrtec knocked me out uddude0uddude i have to follow up with the allergy doctor about the steroid cream though i just want my skin not itching
 canut believe how messed up zyrtec made me couldnut stay up past pm last night woke up at am today and was back asleep by am for another  hours and ium still groggy af argh
 i personally use zyrtec at night so i don't cough or wheeze in my sleep
 i'm suuuuuuuuper sensitive to zyrtec quarter tab and i sleep for  days seriously
 took tylenol zyrtec and drunk alka selzter lastnight before i went to sleep and been sleeping so good all day
 for mcas for me it's zyrtec and pepcid zyrtec made me sleepy until my body adjusted within a couple of weeks now i take  a day haha  hahaha when i started just  would knock me out identifying triggers was the big impact tho turns out corn hates me amp; it's in everything
 i take a generic brand zyrtec but i take it every day at night so if it does make me drowsy ium going to sleep anyway
 zyrtec claritin and allegra should not have that effect if you take a benadryl youure going to sleep
 here in norcal we cycle every year or  our docs switch us from zyrtec to claritin to allegra  nasal sprays it's a minor change but helps esp with our severely allergic benedryl is a once in a while can't sleep or very itchy medicine worth asking about
 if i donut take this with my flonase and zyrtec my head will continue to be so stuffed my eyeballs will pop out of my head and you donut want to be seeing that  hasnut put me to sleep in years
 that's why i don't take benedryl unless i'm trying to go to sleepnzyrtecuddudcaaudcudffe 
 for some reason not only does claritin not work for me it also makes me sleepy allegra only work if i pop them like skittles zyrtec or the generic is a lifesaver
 tw drugs ?? kinda nnbro i remember getting an avil shot and a zyrtec right after it and tbh the sleep quality chefs kiss
 itus funny when i hear benadryl be puttin yuall to sleep lmao my allergies so serious that shit donut even help i gotta use zyrtecuddude0 
 an antihistamine like allegra claratin or zyrtec should took the trick (benadryl too but it might make you sleepy so donut drive) and you can take it before if you anticipate the trigger cool compresses and hydrocortisone cream are good too hope that helps
 yesterday i learned that zyrtec makes me very sleepy when i took one and then my brain blue screened until am this morning
 i brought zyrtec itus working so far i took  an now im sleepy it say nondrowsiness but itus working so far
 yoooo so i never take zyrtec unless ium having an allergic reaction because it makes me sleep hard af for like  hours but yesterday i needed it but i bought a different kind than i normally do i swear that shit had me high af i told my mom about it and she said that i 
 allergies advice i have the worst amp; most severe allergy and sinus symptoms lately nothing has been working claritin zyrtec and allegra do absolutely nothing benadryl works for a few hours but not long enough for me to sleep through the night ium miserable any suggestions?
 yeah i donut know what exactly ium allergic to in the air (everything?) but flonase was way more effective for me and basically no sideeffects zyrtecclaritinetc always dried me out or made me too sleepy
 zyrtec gets the job done and it wonut make you sleepy
 dear dr roach i'm a yearold male with seasonal allergies i often take the generic versions of zyrtec and claritin to deal with the symptoms while neither of those makes me drowsy i do sleep much better u usually longeru 
 dear dr roach i'm a yearold male with seasonal allergies i often take the generic versions of zyrtec and claritin to deal with the symptoms while neither of those makes me drowsy i do sleep much better u usually longeru 
 ugggggh i don't wanna go out again but if i don't get some zyrtec before i go to sleep all of tomorrow is going to be miserable
 outside so bomb feel bad for people who canut sleep with the windows open gotta pop a zyrtec lol
 hmmm thatus saaad well kalau teruk jumpa je specialist or makan zyrtec once a day before sleep dulu pergi clinic biasa ada yang bagi zyrtec and one medicine yang ada steroid which is bad for your body (long term)
 finna pop a zyrtec and sleep til wednesday cuz these allergies spankin my ass
 it puts me to sleep i take zyrtec
 i try to take zyrtec every day during allergy season and it works for me reasonably well benadryl definitely helps but iuve got to block out a whole bunch of time to take it bc it makes me sleepy and then gives me a headache 
 clariton doesn't do anything allegra gave me a migraine and zyrtec makes me sleepy _
 dear dr roach i'm a yearold male with seasonal allergies i often take the generic versions of zyrtec and claritin to deal with the symptoms while neither of those makes me drowsy i do sleep much better u usually longeru 
 oooo im about to sleep good as hell that zyrtec finna knock me the hell out
 itus the good and bad of benadryl that whole sleep like the dead well iuve resworn my loyalty to zyrtec so we will see good luck
 zyrtec make anyone else sleepy?? udduded
 i was prescribed it along with phenylephrine for a sinus infection it was horrible i couldn't sleep i got dizzy irritable my heart pounded and i still had infections nn years later in spring i take zyrtec amp; use a neti pot problem solved why didn't he start here?
 i took that damn zyrtec this morning and ium so fuckin sleepy but i ainut sneezing no morei guess iull get my ass up n go outside and let my hair get some sun so it can speed the drying process
 i cant even fall asleep because my allergies are soo fcking bad ium sneezing every minute no amount of zyrtec will help udduded
 zyrtec might as well be a sleeping pill allahu i cant stay awake
 i take zyrtec in the morning amp; benadryl at night to help me a little more plus to make me sleepy but ium done with her sheus a whore
 mcas neisvoid  tried allegra took half a pill made me completely sleepless going back to zyrtec allrighty then anyone else?
 yes zyrtec makes me very sleepy and my family always thinks ium weird for saying that i havenut taken benadryl in a while but i donut remember it ever making me as tired as zyrtec tbh
 iuve taken a zyrtec and  benadryl and ainut sleep yettf wrong with me ?
 zyrtec amp; flonase  benadryl  but only   putting you to sleep lol 
 yeah but do zyrtec or something that wonut make you sleepy maybe google some antihistamines cuz i donut know brand names like that
 today i am on xyzal and zyrtec and nsaids and last night id taken benadryl before sleep and im finally getting phlegm out after  full weeks
 benadryl and coffee would be good for you boyo i donut drink coffee and just deal with the drowsiness tbh though because i hate caffeine headaches but being sleepy is better than suffering with allergies ium also not patient enough for zyrtec bs
 per my daughters allergist itus best to rotate them so youure body doesnut become too immune zyrtec zycam claritin d and benedryl at night (itull loose itus sleepy effect if you take it enough)
 okay i did some research itus the same thing as the english (zyrtec) you should be okay to take another one ( you might be a little sleepy but if itus am that might not be bad ium not an actual doctor so you donut have to listen to me at all ium just speaking from experience
 an allergy med would probably work better at this point just due to the sheer  of bites but even the nondrowsy ones make me sleepy i had to stop taking zyrtec even at night bc it made me really out of it even the next day
 so apparently if you take at least  zyrtec every day it will make you sleepy thought yuall should know
 andaya daya mo zyrtec pag daytime kita ininom i'm too damn sleepy before bed as prescribed wala pa rin yung antokkkkk
 iuve had to start a regimen of zyrtec benadryl and flonase i take all at night as z and b make me sleepy hope you feel better and find a med that works for you
 hm in that case has he tried a zyrtec at night and an allegra in the morning? i only take an allegra in the morning but my mom has more sensitive eyes than i do and hers flare up more so she does both she takes the zyrtec at night to help also with sleep
 literally same sis it hits me in the morning and then all afternoon ium fine then right before i sleep it hits me again udeuddudduded every day idk what to do wallah itus not everyday take telefast and zyrtec man ium over it
 i take a daily claritin (tried zyrtec) not doing enough when i take a benadryl it helps a lot but it puts me to sleep any recs?
 has zyrtec ever made you sleepy?
 xyzal take it at night helps you sleep doesnut leave you groggy  hour protection
  days ago i started taking xyzal every night for my allergies amp; i swear its a miracle pill i recommend trying that bc its made a hell of a difference  me my dreams have been really nuts lately also when i do sleep you r not alone there wishing u the best on ur next tripuddudc
 even if you don't go all the way to getting tested and shots it could be worthwhile to see an allergist  there are some nextlevel nasal sprays out there (dymista) i didn't know about nnright now the hotness is xyzal which is like zyrtec without the sleepy side effects
 what if anthony rizzo appropriates asleep xyzal in 
 to my knowledge there is no nondrowsy benadryl it does make some people sleepier than others but claritin zyrtec xyzal etc were all meant to be the all day nondrowsy option would def have him take it first thing and those are all once a day benadryl is  hrs
 i use two nose sprays x a day and xyzal this happens to me all the time also grab some nose straps to sleep in
 showusyourmedsnmy med bag effexor xr adderall adderall xr klonopin for depressionanxiety depressionrelated fatigue anxiety attackssleep issues; xyzal singulair albuterol flonase advair auviq for allergies amp; asthma; ashlyna for acne migraine control no babies uddudcd
 try a nondrowsy alternative like zyrtecallegraxyzal or a nasal spray (flonasenasoquart) they don't usually make you sleepy like some of the others
 when people are still wide awake after an ativan ambien melatonin trazadone and a benadryl but i gotta come home and break my xyzal in half so i donut sleep through my alarm uddude0 
 i've been using just a half a xyzal at night greatly helps with allergies with a slow happy roll to a deep sleep ymmv but it has worked well when i remember to take it nni have mg xanax but only take  when losing it be mindful of xanax it's addictive takes the edge off
 have you tried zyrtec or allegra? zytec tends to work pretty well for me it makes me a little groggy but not as bad as benadryl allegra doesn't make me sleepy at all but sometimes gives me a headache and has a nasty rebound when it wears off and i'll sneeze for  minutes
 zyrtec makes me sleepy
 i never take zyrtec but have successfully slept through every earthquake that has happened while i was sleeping since i moved here  years ago
 try breath rights when u sleep i took a zyrtec every day for  years then stopped cold turkey and switched to breath rights i have a deviated septum which gives allergy type symptoms during the day ;)
 i fully endorse zyrtec allergy medicine because apparently it helps you sleep straight through earthquakes
 ok i ainut gon lie that rain sounds delicious outside this sleep gon be a i might even take a zyrtec or xanax for a little razzle dazzle
 me all day  gosh ium tired i wish i could just curl up and nap nnme at bedtime  i wonder if two advil pm a zyrtec lavender essential oil and a dropper full of valerian root in warm milk is ucenoughud to get me to sleep?
 is it bad i just took a zyrtec because it makes me tired and ium exhausted but canut sleep? probably? oh well night night
 zyrtec and either flonase or nasonex take them both at night before bed allergy meds actually work better before sleep than first thing in the morning according to my ent
 oh yes so everyone reacts differently but claritinus active ingredient is typically less strong then zyrtec usually the dosage is day but docs will let you take up to  some people get sleepy with it it used to make me jittery
 i developed cat allergies about  years ago the not sleeping partus the worst either (nni got an air purifier that sits next to bed and keep on overnight mostly on highnnstarted doubling up my zyrtec taking one at night and one in the am
 if you want a good heavy sleep i recommend one zyrtec and one mg melatonin tab nnyou won't wake up in the middle of the night and you will probably feel drowsy the whole next day too
 even if you don't go all the way to getting tested and shots it could be worthwhile to see an allergist  there are some nextlevel nasal sprays out there (dymista) i didn't know about nnright now the hotness is xyzal which is like zyrtec without the sleepy side effects
 oh god i have made a terrible mistake i took a cetirizine as i have been kicking up a lot of dust cleaning exhaustion setting in totally didn't think about the fact i needed to work and that i can use zyrtec as a sleep aid
 if i canut sleep just take zyrtec jfc i slept  hours yesterday udeuddudeudd
 mg benadryl mg ibuprofen some zyrtec allegra and an ipa nnmaybe i shall sleep before being on call tonight
 yuall i was doing bad yesterday my allergies was not playing so my mom brought me some zyrtec bittcchhh why that shit had me feeling like i poud up uddude0 went to sleep at  woke up at  ate  went back to sleep and literally just now waking up
 ah i wasnut trying to sleep on zyrtec have you tried melatonin?
 or even like zyrtec or claritin only bc benadryl might make you super sleepy
 ium impatiently waiting for my zyrtec to kick in so i can breathe and sleep and have crackhead energy at work
 you can give them human allergy pills (zyrtec benadryl etc) and itus will help with them although it may either make them sleepy or hyper so watch out for that
 do you have any air purifiers in your home? they can at least help while you sleep also wearing a mask outdoors (and properly over your nose) can help a bit nothing is a  fix my solution was air purifier zyrtec and nasal sprays during the bad seasons
 ahh yes love it when i feel sick and have to take tylenol and zyrtec in the morning just to try to keep my headache down in the morn and my parents blame the lack of sleep niceeeeeee na night and a day folks a night and a day
 try taking zyrtec or alegra before u sleep works great for me  uddude0
 i really needed to rest some before i make this driveuthat epinephrine worked me up and zyrtec got me halfway sleepynni need to pick up this prednisone and hit  s
 donut take zyrtec during the day it puts me to sleep even though itus supposed to be nondrowsy claritin and allegra work the best for me udeuddudcudffcuduufe0f and a nose spray
 god pressing f to younger me who was dissociating  caus of traumatic life events and also half asleep all the time caus i took zyrtec daily lmao
 me why is my sleep schedule so fucked upnalso me stays up to talk to my bf chugging energy drinks at random times and also taking zyrtec i just dont get it
 sleeps more than usual doesnut hardly eatdrink and it kinda helped reduce the itchiness a tiny bit but not really weuve found that zyrtec regular brushingbaths no outside time helps more he just gets into a habit of worrying on one spot and causing a rash
 it is zyrtec idk it could make me sleep that long nasib baik mcuddude0
 zyrtec casts sleepnme youre not supposed to make me drowsyzzzzzzz
 zyrtec doesnut touch me either it just makes me sleepy
 i take cetirizine (zyrtec) at bedtime for mast cell activation it really helps me sleep and i donut seem to have any negative side effects
 to my knowledge there is no nondrowsy benadryl it does make some people sleepier than others but claritin zyrtec xyzal etc were all meant to be the all day nondrowsy option would def have him take it first thing and those are all once a day benadryl is  hrs
 orange target brand box drug name is levocetirizine dihydrochloride i thought it was the same as the zyrtec so i never got it but this shit is great does make me a little sleepy tho so itll have to be a night time one its  hours tho
 nigga get some zyrtec and go to sleep lol
 i have had xanax tramadol lexotinal nuebrol forte melatonin and zyrtec just to help me sleep (even though most of them are painkillers and anti allergics not sleeping aids) but gravinate takes the cake nothing knocks me out better
 i'm doing the same and now i spend about  of the day asleep because of the zyrtecfrustrating
 ium a fan of a benadryl at night to blunt the allergic effects and assist in sleep every once in a while take zyrtec daily add flonase if symptoms persist neti pots help as do air filters and staying inside
 update i suppose if the green lid allergy pill (which i think is store brand zyrtec?) makes me sleep for three and a half hours then i needed it? i do not think i like the green lid pill but we are out of the purple one and the blue one doesn't work quickly
 psa if your allergies are acting up and you canut breathe get some zyrtec allergy pills as well as benadryl to help you sleep also cvs sells  over the counter inhalers for people with asthma this time of year sucks udeudd
 ugh been off zyrtec since tuesday night for my allergy testing this coming wednesday feeling worse  after saturday night no more benadryli won't be able to sleep at all sunday monday and tuesday night
 try a nondrowsy alternative like zyrtecallegraxyzal or a nasal spray (flonasenasoquart) they don't usually make you sleepy like some of the others
 i try not to unless ium at my parents around all the animals then i take zyrtec d or allegra d otherwise i just try to sleep w the humidifier or diffuser it helps some

 i kirby overthecounter human antihistamines (generic version of zyrtec) last week because of the fireworks i gave him benadryl ( tabs twice a day)because they made him sleepy as well as less itchy
 i scratch in my sleep my legs and arms look bad zyrtec is better if you donut want to be the walking dead but ium not sure if youuve tried it or not
 zyrtec for my allergies antibiotic for acne and sometimes melatonin to help me sleep
 was on autopilot this morning and fucked up and took benadryl instead of zyrtec and i nearly fell asleep pruning the basil
 water zyrtec and sleeping 
 zyrtec taken at night sets you up for the next day with little sleepiness
 damn i havenut even taken my zyrtec and ium already sleepy
 yall ever taken some zyrtec and then went to bed? talk about sleeping peacefully
 when you fall asleep after taking a zyrtec 
 there's a good chance your body will get adjust so you're not drowsy happened to me i switched to zyrtec whknocked me out at first then i adjusted but only to the tablets like a zombie for  hrs wthe gel caps also if your allergies mess wsleep take before bed
 i wish i felt cute right now but instead ium itchy stupid hives just took zyrtec (antihistamine) kick in please (usually takes an hour) ium not scratching but itus driving me nuts going to try and get some sleep work in the morning udduddauddudcb
 lady at the pharmacy ran my id  times like she was looking for open warrants  nndamn lady i just want to sleep in peace tonight  i promise i won't make no meth with this zyrtecd
 xyzal but take it before you go to bed makes you v sleepy
 so for what itus worth my allergy doctor used to prescribe me xyzal it was literally the only thing that kept my allergies at bay without making me sleepy itus over the counter now and i swear by it
 i had to get back on meds bc is out of safe foods but now ium able to eat a lot more foods i take xyzal and famotidine  times a day my first two dosages are early in the morning if i oversleep iull wake up seizuring the meds are definitely helping a lot
 xyzal was a life changer for me every other one i tried made me sleep all day
 maybe? however everything else makes me feel like a zombie or i am flat out sleeping have you tried that one with the owl in the adds what is it xyzal?
 xyzal itus awesome and if you take it before bed every night it helps you sleep
 i canut tell if this xyzal is making me sleepy or if ium already just sleepy
 the xyzal does make me sleepy but itus definitely worth it
 i took a xyzal and some flonase hopefully it clears me up but doesn't make me sleepy lol
 why are medications named so dumb? xyzal? why not getyouthefucktosleep?
 benedryl and zyrtec nalong with a lot of sleep
 my allergist prescribed me zyrtec last year but i ended up not taking it because it made me loopy and prone to sleeping at odd hours ium giving it another try now because i feel loopy and ium constantly falling asleep at odd hours anyway
 i used to take zyrtec every day and that didn't have any side effects (for me) but the others always made me fall asleep best was benadryl but that's practically just sleep medicine
 thank you hopefully zyrtec and flonase will help otherwise lots of laundry (the dog sleeps in our bed) and vacuuming
 tell me every time i took zyrtec for allergy i feel sleepy for next  or  days any reason
 took a zyrtec yesterday and had the deepest sleep in a long ass time 
 just an updatennwas able to sleep for  hours yay spent about  at the pharmacy i switched out zyrtec for allegra amp; it seems to be working so far nni'm going to rest amp; try different suggestions thank you all for the money anything left is going to rent i love you udduded
 you should also take a nondrowsy longacting antihistamine like zyrtec (cetirizine) and you can take benadryl on top of that at bedtime to help you sleep through the discomfort
 no i take about  mg of benadryl every day for sleepnnthis does nothing and i've taken zyrtec and a few other antihistamines not working
 i tried to not go to sleep with taking my zyrtec and i woke up an hour lateruddude this is not good
 do u have seasonal allergies? if so try taking an allergy medicine such as allegra or zyrtec with sudafed congestion itus could be ur sinuses i was the same way gettin migraines to the point i couldnut stand any light and just wanted to sleep
 security comes amp; begins searching the room ms a wakes up  amp; asks what's going on? i explain still sleepy she tells me  i have a bottle of pain meds from homeamp; they are all in one bottleeasier to carrynni nod recalling the tylenol advil zyrtec mix in my purse   
 it was a good day till  hit now i have to take zyrtec and sudafed to try to go to sleep this allergy life never fair
 just took my zyrtec to drown these bitches out and put my ass to sleep
 i took half a pill i shoulduve taken a whole my anxiety is so high that iuve taken a zyrtec d for my allergies and half a xanax and ium still not sleep udduded
 oop yeah i lied mine does say drowsiness may occur maybe i'm just so used to it since zyrtec is my triannual allergy medicine of choice lolololnnyeah i'd hate to take something that makes you sleepy just to suffer less but really suffer more being tired at workschool
 iull be taking a mucinex dm soon as i know their are sleep ugh this is what i get for forgetting my zyrtec this morning uddude
 gurl mine are sooooo bad i take it at night and at day the sleepy one at night and zyrtec in the day
 in the past i've taken benadryl prophylactically before eating crabs and i've had no adverse effects from that it makes me so sleepy though that i can barely get through the meal could i take a claritin or zyrtec?
 so either that zyrtec has messed up my system or the lack of proper sleep has caught up to me
 zyrtec allergy reaction sleepiness udeudd
 ium on a strict regimen of a daily zyrtec style along with occasional benadryl style for severe allergen situations andor when i feel like going to sleep
 take some zyrtec before sleep
 yes i started taking zyrtec for a sun allergy and ended up continuing to take it cause it was helping me sleep eventually had to wean myself off of it but it was hard
 i need to take a benadryl but i donut wanna sleep i took zyrtec this morning hasnut been too helpful but iud hate to think of what my day would be like without that
 i tried claritin instead of zyrtec and itus making me sleepy and my eyes are still itchy not a fan
 mine are  especially with the fires amp; the fact that while i love my cats i am also allergic to them (one reason why life on the con circuit worked so well lol)  i take generic zyrtec every night before i go to sleep it doesn't seem like it helps until i forget then i know
 i went from claritin to zyrtec  first few weeks i was sleepy pants  but my stuffy nose and coughing is gone
 have you tried allegra? zyrtec makes me sleepy and claritin doesnut help
 i use to her prescribed the purest form of zyrtec nnitus stronger nbut it also had me fall asleep on the toilet
 i did night tea my normal zyrtec which usually helps me sleep and a dash of melatonin and was up looking crazy that melatonin will probably kick in for us today around am uddudeduddude0
 yet mine wasnt so bad until we moved here from vic and now on one zyrtec twice a day at least i sleep well now uddude
 one day i didnut need the zyrtec anymore however she doesnut sleep in my bed and doesnut get all over the furniture we like our individual space so it works  we just hang out in the same room i wash my hands a lot too (when i pet her or when she sits in my lap; lint roller)
  hours sleep two ritalin zyrtec d for allergies one hour energy now coffee if i can take a nap on all of the above it is just meant to be
 i did not sleep well and my zyrtec is not doing itus job
 have a bunch of zyrtec and i've been sleeping like the dead )
 aside from zyrtec and wine (which ium not recommending) nothing works for me as a sure method it does help if i get out of bed leave the bedroom and read in another room after a couple hours i usually go right to sleep when i go back to bed
 to be clear zyrtec amp; claritin are nondrowsy they only help you sleep by reducing the discomfort up in your nose benadryl will help but is also sedating not everyone wants that even at night nnflonase is awesome and is otc now thank god
 zyrtec or claritin taken before bed to help you sleepnn(just fyi don't use sudafed every day you can get a rebound effect when you stop which is terrible)nnconsider reducing smoking alternatives to smoking or temporarily stopping smoking give your lungs time to heal
 sleep propped up (it sucks i know) oregano oil zyrtec netti pot and spit everything out that you cough up and have dripping down your throat thats how i always get through it
 neti pots work wekllnni also get the generic zyrtec at costco it works for me when most of the others either donut work for me or make me too sleepynnfeel better friend
 if you think its allergies take generic claritin or zyrtec  benadryl will make you sleepy  or local bee pollen or local honey key is local
 i hated zyrtec at first it made me sleepy i got used to it now i can work with three pills
 zyrtec makes me sleepy   i take allegra  hour  i think it works great maybe you need to switch it up and switch to that or claritin for a few weeks then switch back  sometimes our bodies get used to one and they donut work as well
 you have a case of formication it's causes are many things combined but could be due to to anxiety or lack of sleep or something more serious you should go to your doctor and describe your symptoms and they should give you zyrtecbenadryl to reduce the sensation
 benadryl makes me sleepy because i am a child but i take generic zyrtec daily and it still happens (
 mf zyrtec if u ainut tryna sleep  benadryl pink pills if you tryna go to sleep in about  mins
 my cairn terrier is hypoallergenic lucy i just deal with by taking zyrtec vacuuming well and keeping her out of sleeping areas
 zyrtec (ceterizine) is more effective in bringing sleep than benzodiazepines i said what i said argue with the walls
 when i wake up i sneeze before i go to bed i sneeze i take zyrtec at both these times and i have concluded i am allergic to not being asleep
 i got zyrtec and benadryl to sleepuddudecudcudffcuddudecudcudffchereus to maybe not sneezing for five minutes

 i had allergies after cleaning up my back yard i took a zyrtec and sleep for  hours straight no bathroom nothing  it was magical
 zyrtec usually helps me and doesnut make me sleepy
 i am aside from lack of sleep for various other reasons i do have zyrtec but i have found that only really helps me with seasonal allergies not random breakouts of hives
 i hope you're feeling better look into getting zyrtec if you haven't before it works differently than benadryl and tends to not cause the groggy sleepiness
 i typically take zyrtec since i've found that's what works best for me allegra is hit or miss with menbenadryl knocks me out hard man i sleep for days
 me why am i so sleepy?nalso me took a zyrtec an hour ago
 i just took some benadryl for the first time in like a year because i had no more zyrtec and my allergies were acting up and i just know ium gonna sleep so good tonight
 dude the human body is so weird i used to take zyrtec for my allergies suddenly years later i can't take it cuz it makes me ridiculously sleepy where it didn't before sleepy to the point of nonfunctional basically and i'm like???
 i hate when itus late and my stomach starts growling bout to take a zyrtec so i can fall asleep fast uddude0

 oh yes i'm still very twitchy everywhere including my face i get both myolonic jerks amp; fasciulations and sleep is still hit or miss  small doses of cbd oil before bed  a zyrtec  a pepcid  magnesium have seemed to be best for sleep without a lot of neuro symptoms
 that's calling allergies zyrtec withdrawal those people would have sleep or appetite problems either way
 running on no sleep zyrtec and a puff bar good morning
 twitter's acting upnsuffering alone would be the worst i have a caregiver so i'm never alone i know mr insomnia very well when i get desperate i take zyrtec  that's if nothing else (lavender tea progressive relaxation etc etc etc)  works  i wish for you a restful sleep
 i didn't kno that zyrtec cud make me this sleepy uddudee
 sertraline aka zoloft also stopped taking cetirizine (aka zyrtec) entirely two drugs with sideeffects of sleepiness and mental fog and without them i feel like superman )
 wow so glad i saw this post i have been having a horrible time with sleep more so than usual lately and i have been taking zyrtec because my allergies got bad going to stop today and see if it helps
 the fact that i had to take zyrtec to go to sleep smh
 trazadone and zyrtec help me sleep even just a few hours hope your day gets better
 same tho cos zyrtec makes me sleepy but i alternate cos telfast is expensive and i have a condition where i have to take antihistamines every single day
 i've been having the worst allergies for  whole fucking days now amp; certain things are starting to taste like metal to me wtf is thisuddudeduddudedudduded my allegra hasn't arrive yet amp; i can't buy zyrtecd til tmrrw all i have is my nightly allergy med that makes me too sleepy help me ;  ; 
 me too taking allegra here tried claritan zyrtec and xyzal took benadryl a bit ago should be sleeping soon
 whenever you feel infection i'm throughsneezingcold ntake one tablet of xyzal (levocetirizine) mg one at night before sleeping in most of the cases it helps relieving the symptomsnnbest regards
 like i went  days without xyzal and yesterday i sneezed and sniffed all day i had to take a benadryl just to get some sleep only got  hours hence why ium up now and my right nostril is currently completely useless sinus headache all day i hate it here
 i have to work nights on the weekend and am so fired up at am i pop either anzyrtec nxyzal ntylenol pmnso i can sleep
 xyzal works really good for me but authentic benadryl does the job better than no other if youure talking sleep n symptoms
 try xyzal best i have ever had for allergies and didnt make me sleepy
 i would try xyzal (levocetirizine) it's the one antihistamine that my former allergist (the only person i trust with this stuff) uses and i've been using it for years best result very minimal sleepiness and side effects nnalso mention singulair to your doc 
 you might want to try taking the zyrtec x a day it doesn't make me sleepy so i've never had that as a side effectbother nntemptes by xyzal but i'll wait until costco gets a generic
 me haha im gonna take a zoloft and zyrtec so ill fall asleep fastnme still wide awake a few hours later ') nothing bad ever happens to the kennedy's
 me too taking allegra here tried claritan zyrtec and xyzal took benadryl a bit ago should be sleeping soon
 this zyrtec got me sleepy
 allergist said zyrtec makes one in ten people sleepy so i could change to allegra if it does that to menni'm not sure how to tell her that i'm a little sleepy all the time so i'm not sure how i'll tell
 i feel that i found out i was suddenly allergic to cats after getting a kitten (despite owning many cats when i was younger) hopefully like me you can keep it under control with an antihistamine i take zyrtec at night so i wake up with no allergies as my cats sleep by my face
 take a pill called zyrtec it'll make you very sleepy but it works
 i'm allergic to cats and have two that sleep with me nightly i've never taken an allergy shot i take zyrtec daily and if the cats bother me after that i take a benadryl
 youure probably going to have to experiment multiple family members with various allergies respond differently to benadrylnnzyrtec may help without making you sleepy (then again it may not help or it may help while also making you sleepy)
 claritin works well for light allergies and is non drowsy benadryl for heavy days but does make you sleep iuve tried all others and they make me jittery especially zyrtec stay away from that one
 zyrtec or the generic version of it is my go to allergy med claritin didnut work and benadryl made me sleepy
 i broke up with benadryl to try improve my sleep quality but i need some allergy meds  day for zyrtec not sustainable
 hey emily  thatus pretty much what iuve done  but i took  benadryl and am about to go to sleep and i put on some antiitch lotion ium hoping one of the teachers will have a zyrtec or something nondrowsy so i donut have to leave school to get some
 trust me take a benadryl claritin and zyrtec take a couple days to kick in benadryl starts working on the allergy reactions immediately and if u get drowsy from it helps you with sleeping if ur nose is stuffy
 allegra generic  zyrtec is very good but put me to sleep  my mom says it takes done getting used to but allegra is totally non drowsy i have taken it daily for many years (texas allergies) nbut check if  hr or  hr nmight need benadryl to help you sleep if it persists
 i was up so early this morning but proceeded to take a zyrtec so it's just been sleepy time hours
 bro why tf can i not sleep i am so close to taking zyrtec
 i've the same issue though zyrtec and monthly are the best for this ie dust allergy udeudd and make sure your bed is clean while you sleep else make it clean with a dettol spray or change bedsheet
 cake frosted dinner in the oven ium surprised i havenut been asleep yet cause i took my zyrtec this morning but i know itus coming
 ah ok thanks i wasnut sure what to do for it itus not getting better will take benadryl later cuz it puts me to sleep maybe for now i can take claritin or zyrtec
 i would like to go back to sleep but ium out of zyrtec and i canna breeeeeve
 i buy big bottles of generic unisom from amazon though the downside for taking it for allergies is that working faster also means making you way sleepier than the tablets if i don't need the super fast action i just do an extra zyrtec dose because of fewer side effects
 missing my bfnwhen am i gonna fall asleep i took zyrtec for a reason
 unfortunately benadryl is shortlived zyrtec provides you with all day relief but i agree lol that does aid sleep
 i have to work nights on the weekend and am so fired up at am i pop either anzyrtec nxyzal ntylenol pmnso i can sleep
 benadryl is basically a sleeping pill cause i wake and my allergies still trying to take me out time to move up to zyrtec
 zyrtec make me sleepy
 i used to have this from age  it would cover my entire body amp; face it was soooo awful sorry you are going through this zyrtec worked for me back then but it made me very sleepy ium sure you did extremely well hope it goes away soon
 zyrtec makes me too sleepy but it does work greay i take flonase i canut figure out if spring or autumn (hay fever) allergies are worse udeudd
 same here girl flonase and nose sprays never worked for me my go to allergy management is  pills of zyrtec every morning some say sorted makes them sleepy but thatus not the case for me ium always clear
 yes but better ask your doctor st if not zyrtec comes to my mind because it was always easy to find worldwide anyway any drugs with cetirizine levocetirizine (i used both) loratadine as said by rafael or maybe desloratadine just take care it may make you a bit sleepy
 zyrtec is good for me but it also makes me sleepy
 oh god zyrtec never again it was like a sleeping pill crossed with a stupid pill
 me waking up every morning solely to pop a zyrtec into my mouth and go back to sleep
 flonase works and zyrtec is effective but it makes me sleepy
 my nose has been clogged non stop for like  months now? i take zyrtec and the nose spray every day i'm not sure what's happening have to have breathe right strips when i sleep lol

 yes take the zyrtec cause otherwise you might randomly cough  times when halfasleep at am immediately convince yourself its covid and launch into a huge panic attack with difficulty breathing for an hour only to laugh at yourself the next day when you are totally fine
 my son had the worst case of this for years he struggle to sleep and do anythingnthe biggest change in his life came when he had zyrtec (it's a tablet for hayfever and allergies)nplease have try of it it has changed his lifeni wish you good luck
 zyrtec gels floor me i donut even remember going to sleep
 took a zyrtec because of all the pollen today i thought these second gen antihistamines were nondrowsy? i just had a glorious hour sleep
 zyrtec (cetirizine) is better amp; if makes you sleepy take at night  can help with insomnia amp; itching too claritin (loratadine) or flonase (inhaled) also very good alternatives over the counter
 i took a full zyrtec instead of half so i could sleep longer but now im just awake and very tired
 if you can stand the feeling nasal sprays work quickly if off brand zyrtec or claritin don't put you to sleep those are both good options good luck
 zyrtec may have helped a bit more unsure got a brain swab for miss rona anyway just in case and allegedly itus only taking  hours for results i fell asleep on my stomach to help suppress the urge to cough last night so thatus fun
 my hobby is taking my zyrtec in the morning and going back to sleep immediately cancelling it's effects by breathing in more bed dust

 i take xyzal at night as it makes me sleepy at times bonus
 alzheimer's doesn't affect every single person much of it is hereditary but some is caused from long term use of prescription drugs or otc meds like diphenhydramine  omeprazole etc if you take benadryl to sleep or for allergies switch to zyrtec or xyzal

 except claritin is antihistamine (nd gen just means it doesnut cross the bloodbrain barrier as readily so less drowsiness) ndiphen st gen  sleepy nboth have anticholinergic effects tho (drying up your nose)nzyrtec amp; allegra are antih without anticholinergic activity
 ugh either itus the cold or the zyrtec or both but ium so wiped outnni did very little but sleep get the baby fed breakfast and into bed and have a telehealth appointment today and ium wiped outnnliterally tired in my toes
 nothing like a am cocktail of flonase and zyrtec to put you back to sleep
 they donut make you sleepy i think   the one that works good for me is benadryl but i canut function with that so now i take zyrtec every morning and my allergies are pretty controlled
 yo not so fun fact you can suffer withdrawal from zyrtec (itus not super common but common enough that thereus literature) so i stopped zyrtec after  years using it seasonally when i was needing benadryl to sleep through the symptoms and function regularly
 the inside of my ears is itching so fucking bad itus impacting my whole entire day and keeping me from sleeping i did a teladoc appt and the lady said itus just allergies zyrtec will help but goddamn i am sufferingudduded
 dosed up on zyrtec and benadryl for allergies my regular meds one of which is for sleeping and another has a side effect of drowsiness and some tylenol pms iull see you guys day after tomorrow
 took a zyrtec bc my head is all congestedni usually cannot sleepni just barely pulled myself off the couchnhope i can wake up tomorrow nownuddudenweird
 good lord now i cannot sleep due to allergies sampai mati ke aku nak kena bergantung terhadap zyrtec ni haha zzzzzzz pedihnya hidup pantang ada habuk sikit
 took  zyrtec and them bitches made me fall asleep guess what? when i woke up nose still fucking stopped up uddude
 zyrtec works best for me for  hour relief but i would  suggest taking it at night it says nondrowsy but it still makes me sleepy
 zyrtec helps take it at night it helps you to sleep as well if you have an issue with congestion zyrtecd
 i took allegra for years but it stopped working so i switched to zyrtec recently and ium happy with it i mix it with the off brand sudafed to make it zyrtec d but cheaper i tried claritin and it made me too sleepy
 zyrtec but taken at night first few days will make you sleepy it is amazing when nothing else works
 zyrtec a have you sleep for  days uddude it ainut no joke
 how many benadryl and zyrtec it take to put me to sleep? im on and rn
 zyrtec or claritin in the day amp; benadryl or mucinex sinus(night) to sleep at night 
 claritin or zyrtecnnor benedryl if you don't mind being asleep
 i was taking cetirizinezyrtec while visiting skaghaus for my cat allergies and it helped me a lot at the time amp; usually held up through the whole day so id take them before sleeping which counteracted any sleepiness (tho there wasnt much of it iirc)
 i think i may have actually gotten some of your sleep energy then because i finally got a full  hours (after popping some zyrtec to knock me out that is lol uddude) ium sorry uddudeduddudc
 been sleeping under the fan amp; not taking my zyrtec udeudd
 peak has had a runny nose for days and itus really bad when he sleeps during nap and bedtime itus all clear so i know itus allergy related should i ask for more zyrtec at his  month check up or is there anything else i can do?
 i think the biggest factor was that the second attempt at hayfever control (claratyne this time instead of zyrtec) finally kicked in plus some better 'sleep hygiene' before bed ncan't promise i'll be able to repeat it tonight nor that it'll work for you
 i take zyrtec at night helps clear it up also i started sleeping on my husband pillow keeps me more upright super comfy i think every spoonie needs one
 that zyrtec i took earlier is about to have me on my ass ium so sleepy
 no more zyrtec for me iuve been so sleepy all day and i felt like my brain couldnut connect with the rest of my body iull take the sniffles over this any day udeudd
 took a zyrtec last night and have been sleepy and hungover all day
 zyrtec make some sleepy uddude
 my only solace for you is that ium usually good by november so fingers crossed udduded i do a morning and afternoon zyrtec but sometimes struggling to sleep well at the moment
 girl iuve been using the lavender to go to sleep cus i stay sneezing before bed and it just ends up knocking me out uddude zyrtec is my bestfriend rn lol
 anyone take zyrtec? if i take it at night will i be sleepy the next day?
 no but seriously my allergies make my nose swell make it difficult to breathe difficult to sleep have caused earaches amp; jaw pain amp;ndoctors are like sorry take some zyrtec i guess
 yeah meds like that definitely make me feel like a zombie too i may skip a day of my daily zyrtec since it makes me sleepy once itus out of my system and i take it again maybe thatus the reset i need lol
 when i've tried lavender teaoleation with lavender oilvalerian tea  progressive relaxation and a few other things and still cannot sleep and am desperate for sleep i take a zyrtec (an antihistamine) it can take up to an hour to work but it usually delivers  a  hour sleep
 when seasonal allergies make you sleep all day and you are up all night sigh at least i could breathe and not have a headache after taking zyrtec then slept due to tired eyes from sinus pressureuddude
 after a night of drinking and little to no sleep my dumbass decided to take zyrtec right before work to seal my fate udeudduddude
 apoquel is great it can be costly though and you have to get it through a vet we tried benadryl but it made our dog sleepy now he is on zyrtec (cetirizine)  a day and has not licked his feet since it has been really helpful hope this helps
 claritin isn't supposed to make you sleepy but all the antihistamines i've tried knock me out sometimes i take half of a  mg zyrtec which helps a little bit doesn't knock me out too badly  ngood thing flonase works well for me so i can usually do wout antihistamines
 that zyrtec got me sleepy asf
 zyrtec works for me seriously though the harder you try to make yourself sleep the less chance you have of actually achieving it
 i thought zyrtec wasnut supposed to make you sleepy yet here we are uddudeuddudeuddude
 this morning i had  choicessneezingsniffing all day or be sleepyim sleepy and aint sneezing thanks to zyrtec and nose spray cuz these allergies be on 
 does your zyrtec have you sleepy?
 alzheimer's doesn't affect every single person much of it is hereditary but some is caused from long term use of prescription drugs or otc meds like diphenhydramine  omeprazole etc if you take benadryl to sleep or for allergies switch to zyrtec or xyzal
 zyrtecinduced sleep is the best one's out like a candle for  hours straight a much needed break from life
 sinus headaches  uddudednncherry on top fixed only by zyrtec but zyrtec makes sleepysleep so the choices are n drown in my own snot or n sleepysleep and no work done uddude 
 took a zyrtec and had a very good sleepdream   days in a row iuve had a certain dream
 okay weird questionhave you started a different allergy med? because when i took zyrtechard nap every single day in the afternoon like could not prevent it if i sat downi was falling asleep
 zyrtec makes me feel like that sudafed makes me feel slightly jittery but also like a happyfocused superhero (i donut take it much or i wonut sleep)
 taking zyrtec before you go to bed just makes it so that you sleep through the whole onset and peak of the dose
 i'd take the benadryl before sleeping and the zyrtec before being awake whichever way that pans out
 drugstore asapnmy head is throbbingnnow if i could just recall which allergy medicine actually workedudeuddnzyrtec i think but did it make me sleepy?nugh that's why i try not taking themnhmmmmnheadache or inability to stay awake?n(i love autumn i do i really doudduded)
 just took a zyrtec it'll help me sleep as well i hope uddudefuddudef
 i need a zyrtec how me supposed to sleep
 see i don't have a prescription anymore because i use to use zyrtec and it didn't make me sleeply but once they made it over the counter i switched to something else still not perscipton and it gets me every time
 i'm blaming my sleep issues for this past week on allergies with the weather changes in constant flux with the changes in season they are going berserk it sucksnni take two benadryl when i go to bed and a zyrtec in the morning it doesn't feel like it's helping
 ask his doctor to give him zyrtec we have to give it to jj it doesnut make him sleepy either
 happy sunday hope yuall are having a great weekend itus gone by fast udcudfudcudf nfeeling ok when i woke up just little congestion bodyfingers stiffness just a bit maybe fmy st flu shot diarrhea since yesterday amp; zyrtec last night had me sleeping in uddudefudcudffbuddudcb chemo cancer 
 i've been taking generic zyrtec at night before i go to sleep just to keep me from waking up with heinous postnasal drip every morning ugh what the fuck is with this fall allergy season shit
 i canut sleep usually my zyrtec takes care of this problem for me itus fine everything is fine 
 just waiting for my zyrtec to kick in so i can go to sleep
 fyi benadryl was originally developed as a sedative for fall allergies in texas itus allegra or claratin zyrtec will also work but it will also put you to sleep but benadryl should only be taken at night
 they say zyrtec doesnut make you sleepy ium sleepy af
 zyrtec is the cousin of piriton and you'll definitely be sleepy after taking one refrain from taking though else your system will develop immunity try herbal stuff as far as possible
 here i am at work minding my business and sleep just comes to bitch slap me in the face uddudeuddudennium definitely about to start taking melatonin with my zyrtec
 it really is unpredictable i was told to try taking zyrtec ium not sure if it really helped me or not but other than that i was told to keep drinking a lot of water and sleep i heard at the time that lemon water could be helpful but i really had to wait it out in my room
 thanks non drowsy? because zyrtec has been having me sleep the past  days
 iuve learned that if i take a combination of melatonin and zyrtec at about 00 i can get a full nightus sleep
 whew the zyrtec x tequila shots combo bout to have me sleeping until tomorrow night udeuddeudcudffeudduded
 nope but i sleep like crazy when i take it you could try zyrtec and an allergy nasal spray
 it donut matter what allergy medicine i take benadryl claritin zyrtec it makes me sleepy uddude0
 zyrtec  uchey bro hehe i see you got allergies wouldnut it be crazy if i make you super drowsy and dizzy everytime you get up? hahaha  but you canut sleep tho cause i lowkey also cause insomnia but you can lay in bed all day ud
 ps you can also take zyrtecclarytine with phenergon you just may sleep (i promise this is legit)
 cw medicationnndaily zyrtec local honey benadryl to sleep mucinex if it goes to my chest also on singular ongoing so i donut get bronchitis again so fun
 i took a claritin zyrtec and benadryl there i washed it down with  mg of melatonin i should be able to sleep uddude tonight
 i find claritin doesn't make me as sleepy as others but it also doesn't work at all zyrtec i can't take even at night because i  am exhausted the whole next day
 i double up if itus bad i do a flonase and zyrtec somebody told me their doctor said to take zyrtec at dinner time because itull help you sleep  a double win
 zyrtec helps take it at night it helps you to sleep as well if you have an issue with congestion zyrtecd
 so i fell asleep in front of a fan and open window and iuve been paying for it for the past  days nnzyrtecd and flonase literally saved my life  nnjust in case the weather is messing anyone else up uddude
 have you tried claritin or xyzal? neither put me to sleep and i'm really sensitive to anything that could possibly put you to sleep
 i take it or xyzal for allergies that bother my sleep with sleep apnea itus cpap no sleep meds
 ium thankful for discovering xyzal this year my winter time allergies really shot up more than usual so i tried something new and xyzal did what needed to be done it helped open up my nasal airway so i could sleep at night uddudefudcudffeuddudefudcudffe ty 
 i really need a benadryl but then iull be gloriously half asleep while putting thanksgiving lunch together so itull have to be xyzal lt;ahchoogt;
 if you have allergies get some xyzaldouble benefit of allergy control and sleep  donut dare take it during the day though or youull never stay awakei have made that mistake
 i take xyzal and maximum strength famotidine daily i aim to take  dosages of each a day but sometimes itus an extra dosage (like if i eat something thatus higher in histamines or i donut get enough sleep) i also take  vials of cromolyn a day
 i remember my allergies were bad over the spring and i was taking xyzal and took em in the morning then saw the commercial that said take em at night no wonder i would fall asleep in my car after lunch lmao
 hell if i know for months iuve been taking both a mg melatonin and a xyzal together every night an hour before ucbedtimeud and still struggling to sleep uddude0
 ugh i can relate my sinuses are so full that i have switched one of my otc meds to xyzal which is nighttime amp; helps with sleep being able to breathe when you wake up is such a blessing
 u dont have to choose they have alelrgy meds that dont make u sleep just take zyrtec u can get over the counter off brand version at walmart for cheap 
 i tried taking zyrtec thinking that was going help me sleep
 claritin? allegra? would thought help? ni know a zyrtec at bedtime and i sleep thru the alarm  nbenadryl is just as bad but sleepy  hours lol
 zyrtec is literally super strong for no reason i canut tell if itus a sleeping pill disguised as an allergy pill or what?
 let me pop a zyrtec with  hours of sleep we are going to fight to the death
 thats what i take zyrtec   hr before bed so i can sleep
 iuve taken a kenalog shot for allergies you might ask your doctor about it also zyrtec or the generic works and lasts  hours take at night really helps with sleep a bonus
 depends what type of mucinex and what you are trying to treat guaifenesin alone is useless antihistamine like citirizine (zyrtec) or loratadine (claratin) plus pseudoephedrine (for congestion but may not let you sleep) amp; dextromethorphan (for cough) are good combinations
 finally got some sleep last night by going up on my main h blocker zyrtec hydroxyzine might as well be a placebo lost my  pillow because i started reacting to the threading who needs a pillow anyway
 your goin to take  zyrtec a day and then before you go to sleep pop two benadryl
 i need some zyrtec so bad uddudeudduded  i know ium not gonna be able to sleep tonight
 at first i thought the hives were caused by cold temperatures but it developed more when i realized i wasn't getting enough sleep i only take zyrtec as needed instead of prophylactically otherwise it'll give me more reason not to sleep uddude0
 the whole point is that it's not supposed to make me sleepy i can't take zyrtec because it makes me pass the fuck out
 i use allegra personally zyrtec knocks me out in like an hour and i end up sleeping longer than i should
 zantac was the other med so zyrtec and zantac controlled them really well for me that is really rough i would definitely recommend asking them to look for ana positive blood result trouble sleeping can be a sign of thyroid disease too
 my dad was allergic at first but i told him to take some zyrtec any time it acts up cuz those cats ainut going nowhere he canut sleep without snow now
 thanks janice yes i did i took a zyrtec but shoulduve taken benadryl instead as i was itchy again last night amp; up xus but i got sleep and thatus good nhope youure doing ok have a nice day uddudcb
 zyrtec never made me sleepy i take mine in the am

 having  kids is enough in and of itself but i have always found zyrtec makes me sleepy and kinda spacey
 iuve started taking a zyrtec during the kids bedtime routine but then get drowsy putting the girlies to bed do we think itus the zyrtec or the having  kids thing making me sleepy?
 zyrtec a deal wid mi wickedly sleep a box mi and mi a box it back uddudeduddudedudduded
 zyrtec making me sleepy as fuck it's even worse than benadryl lmao
 i use the  mg melatonin i have a hard time getting and staying asleep that's on top of benadryl amp; zyrtecuddude0
 don't matter if i take the name brand or off brand zyrtecima be drowsy nncanthaverunnyeyesifyoureasleepncantsneezeifyoureasleep
 allergies i swear i donut know what changed but every time i take you ium sleep for the rest of the day i try to take at night is there a non drowsy?

 my coworker gave me some zyrtec amp; now ium sleepy as shit i forgot it makes you drowsy (
 i had awful eczema when i was younger and still have sensitive skin here are some things that helped men antiitch cream is a life savern wear socks or oven mitts over your hands when you go to sleepn zyrtec is the only allergy pill that helps itching
 sure i could stop taking three naps a day so i can sleep properly at night or i could take a zyrtec a dramamine and a bong rip and pass out instantly
 ahh loratadine my old friend i used to do a rotation between the major hayfever meds  claratynezyrtectelfast and also have a nasal spray handy so i could actually fall asleep at night
 take  to  zyrtec i bet you will fall asleep you won't be able to help it i am not usually so tired but with that much sedating medication i just want to sleep without the meds i can't breathe and itch i am allergic to all weeds and trees and grass
 its almost am n i could probably just sleep this off if it wasnt so itchy rn i wish i still had zyrtec on hand rn udduded
 this is going to be a long day i just looked at the clock and thought is it really only  am? the zyrtec so maybe the kid sleeps longer (and because of allergies) didn't work well  am instead of 
 i took some zyrtec now im sleepy aabudduded
 you should try flonase claritin or zyrtec iud hate to tell you to up your benadryl dosage cause youull prob fall asleep
 this is the worst i've been in a long time  feel so exhausted and have been sleeping way more than normal  after the strep result the doc gave me zyrtec and tylenol  wtf?  i don't have allergies sigh
 i was having the worst allergy attack earlier so i took a zyrtec (with a cup of coffee which was probably not the smartest decision) but anyway i decided i was just going to sleep it off but now ium wide awake and my eyes are still kind of fat and it feels funny to blink )

 zyrtec makes me fall asleepueven after  years of continuous use
 the only time that ever happened to me was when i tried to stop taking zyrtec cold turkey my legs itched so much i scratched bruises into them in my sleep i just take the zyrtec every day now forever
 i am taking so much allergy medication to prevent there from being any question as to whether itus allergies or covid zyrtec by day benadryl by night and a nasty nasal spray that ium always trying to get off ofitus workingubut i just want to sleep all the time uddudec

 oh so i have really bad allergies for decongestant allergy meds you used to need a prescription but i found out recently now i can just buy it off the shelf instead of asking my doctor for a script my kind can make you super sleepy uddude (zyrtecd) and benadryl knocks me out
 there's no help for you now you have taken the bullet train to sleepytime junctionnnbut in the future if you just have regular pollenmolddander allergies? you might be able to use another allergy reliever like levocetirizine or loratadine (xyzal xyrtec claratin)
 i've recently shifted to using xyzal at bedtime and am getting away better quality sleep  finding the right h blocker for bedtime is a needed thing to do
 claritin is pretty weak so maybe try switching to a different one my doc recommends zyrtec (could make you sleepy so take it at night) or xyzal allegra works pretty well for me personally and claritin did almost nothing for me
 apparently xyzal makes me super sleepy
 phone goes in the living room computer under the bed white noise machine blackout curtains but most of all melatonin xyzal (seasonal allergy med that also makes you sleepy) and prescriptionsnnoh also when i was younger i would read no electronics for half an hour before
 im still gonna visit and let the cat sleep on me and i'll be very happy and very allergic  i'll overdose on zyrtec
 i took zyrtec but i still canut sleep what sorcery is this?
 take allergy medication zyrtec and flonasesaline nasal spray to keep your passages open hydrate hydrate hydrate (it sucks but do it) get plenty of sleep and rest donut try to keep up a busy pace itull hurt you
 zyrtec makes me sleepy thatus why i got claritin
 even tab zyrtec didn't helped i had done second wash with epsom salt i really need to sleep right know may the itchiness go away amin

 zyrtec makes me sleepy
 how to survive covid at home  sleep sleep sleep   weeks of sleep fruit juice gargle vodka ( donut drink that lowers the immunity ) find a sunny window a soak up vitamin d in the sun uufe0f tunafish has vitamin d amp; zyrtec decongestant if it gets on your lungs more sleep 
 my cousin who i was nursing through the glass taking food and checking on her every day  she slept for  weeks  made it through covid hereus what we did  the key uddudd is to sleep sleeping heals  also  water fruit juice and zyrtec decongestant if you are congested  
 so if you donut have a headache your fever is gone  youure technically getting better  sleep on your stomach helps the lungs take zyrtec decongestant () to clear lungs  stay in the light
 i love my zyrtec but canut take it at night it keeps me awake a bunch of them do benedryl doesnut it doesnut make me sleepy either a big dose by iv has a mild relaxingsedative effect though
 (also my shift was replacing zyrtec at bedtime with benadryl at bedtime i forget the generic names but i'm in the us so those versions also also h blockers do not make me sleepy so that's not the mechanism)
 me and my cousin recovered with sleep for  weeks  gargle vodka (donut drink since that lowers immunity) lots of v juice amp; tunafish for vitamin d amp; sun amp; zyrtec decongestant if it went on the lungs   itus deep sleep that heals
 cousin survived covid n weeks of sleep uddudca nv juice ntunafish and sun for vitamin d nwater gargle vodka ( donut drink ) to clean  nzyrtec decongestant if it was on her lungs (over the counter )nme taking food amp; chatting through the window every day 
 i shoulduve been sleep after i took that zyrtecuddude
 claritin is pretty weak so maybe try switching to a different one my doc recommends zyrtec (could make you sleepy so take it at night) or xyzal allegra works pretty well for me personally and claritin did almost nothing for me
 i know damn well i'm allergic to seafood yet here i am eating it now i have the illest stomach ache and zyrtec makes me soooo drowsy calling it a day and taking my drowsy ass to sleep 
 i don't feel it on my skin but at night the air is so dry that i start wheezing in my sleep so i've been taking a zyrtec and zinc before bed
 me and my cousin had it  the best cure is sleep it was  weeks of sleeping for me she is on week   apple cider vinegar gargle vodka ( donut drink it lowers immunity) and zyrtec decongestant if it gets to your lungs ()  this is massive  clears the lungs 
 sleeping on the wrong type of pillow will even give me a migraine dehydration or not eating will give me migraines amp; sometimes seasonal allergies if i donut catch it amp; take a zyrtec will give me a migraine those are my main triggers all discovered on the app
 imagine having a really good game get ruined by your computer alarm reminding you to take your zyrtec before going to sleep lol
 i popped a zyrtec at  and just popped a melatonin so i should be able to sleep the whole night hopefully i can't wait to get some coin so i can buy weed and actually get a real sleep
 yalla zyrtec do your magic and send me to sleep
 ium the type of tired that reached for sleeping pills and took zyrtec instead udeuddudcudffduduufe0fuddude
 zyrtec iu00etim bayu0lmayu0 bekliyorumni can't get no sleep
 zyrtec sedates me might take it moments before sleep i still have to study uddudeduddudc thank you for the kind gesture though udcudf
 im guessing bc i was mildly sleepy the zyrtec just tipped me over into full on sleep lmao
 although i will say that after interviewing last weekish i just swapped my bedtime zyrtec for benadryl and early sleep quality results are promising though also i have a lot more tinkering to do 
 it's not drowsy for most people zyrtec makes me sleepy and i know it doesn't affect everyone (
 luv takin a zyrtec after drinking is it going to make me sleepy? or is it going to keep me up all night? who knows
 i know benadryl and sometimes zyrtec can but people use sudafed to make meth (why they keep it behind the counter now) so i think the typical side affects are more towards nervousness and trouble sleeping uddude0uddude0 just coming from someone who takes allergy medsdecongestants
 otc stuff like zyrtec helped me personally; antihistamines like that can help treat anxiety for the short term i'd usually take it an hour or two before bed to help calm me down and allow me to sleep
 hyper vigilance is gonna be the death of me via lack of sleep nd i hate ittttttt ium taking melatonin gummies started taking my zyrtec at night got a weighted blanket and a white noise machine but ya bish still waking up every few hrs uddude
 i need my zyrtec back claritin didnut work for me zyrtec makes me sleep all night and all day though udeudd benadryl doesnut even work anymore for me uddudeuddudeuddude
 finished my round of antibiotics and the agonising head pressure is back doctor says to try zyrtec and flonase also waiting on my new mouth guard for jaw clenching bc i broke mine in my sleep a few weeks ago 
 do they give you pre meds? cause they give me tylenol zyrtec and benadryl just in case i have an allergic reaction and i sleep the entire  hours even when they take my blood pressure every  mins lol
 yes i take zyrtec every day year round try to limit sleeping wher next to my face (sheus good about sleeping next to me or at my feet) wood floors sweepvacuum regularly oh and sheus white which is supposed to help too
 extremely grateful that zyrtec doesn't make me sleepy
 lol i always keep benadryl on hand for when zyrtec won't cut it during allergy season by the time i reach for the benadryl i've earned the awesome sleep i get cessation of allergies plus deep relaxing sleep? no problem
 try an antihistamine such as claritene or zyrtec (i think zyrtec makes you sleepy though)
 zyrtec made me sleep for almost half a day today
 i also do a daily zyrtec in allergy season i'd resort to benadryl if super itchysneezy and if you're cool with sleeping for the next  hours
 i was on claritin for years (when it was prescription) then i tried zyrtec and it put me right to sleep allegra for years and now i've been using flonase for years eventually they all stopped being effective
 slept in today mainly due to taking the second half of my zyrtec this morning when i fed the pets it really makes me sleepy which is why i try to take as little as possible happy saturday mark and all udeudd 
 also ium not a health professional and he can make his own choices but as someone who is allergic to dogs and sleeps with a longhaired dog every night the combo of zyrtec and flonase has been life changing the generics are cheap too
 took a zyrtec for my allergies imma sleep well tonight uddude0euddude0e see u guys in  hours
 the next time you need benadryl take a zyrtec with a zantac same effect no sleepiness
 i took a allergy pill supposed to be like zyrtec it had that in it omg my heart was pounding and i too have blood pressure issues ium on  pills never ever will i take that one but allergy ed non drowsy does not have that in it and much better scary couldnut sleep
 i took a zyrtecd  hours ago and ium still not sleepy itus wine time
 i always go through the same thing in my head u is it allergies covid lack of sleep or dehydration? one zyrtecd and a glass of water later and ium back from the dead
