 that article was fucking infuriating that poor mother equating not giving tamiflu with people who treat deadly infections with potatoes is borderline libelous

 let me correct this for you brandynna child is dead after his mom followed doctor's orders and gave him tamiflu is tamiflu the right treatment for flu in young children? 
 antivirals like tamiflu are only prescribed when a patient is genuinely in danger of dying from the flu the amount of cases where people say nah i don't need it the doctors just overreacting and end up dead is rampant
 this mama did not ucwillingly killud her own child she made a judgment call on deadly tamiflu and has never claimed to be an antivaxx parent she took him in and the doctors dismissed her concerns of dayslong fever they are more at fault than she
 judge and jury according credible news mom did give the tamiflu unless you guys can prove that she didn't you should probably shut it a child is dead and a reporter is reporting as  fact  something she learned from social media? maybe the reporter should pay the mom

 tx to despicable freakazoid fanatic ignorant antiscience antivaxxers convincing a mother not to give her child tamiflu that child is now dead nnantivax is huge threat to public health nnoh and btw adding to his other horror trump totally supports the antivax movement
 it reduces complications people die from the flu it can be deadly in people with chronic health problems instead of getting pneumonia and dying from the flu people get a much milder infection and live tamiflu works
 where did i say you should be shunned? i said you are an embarrassment to me as a verizon retiree a child is dead because antivaxxers on facebook told a mother she should not give her  year old tamiflu because there could be side effects  i do not need to educate myself
 and hotez is on there saying thank you  they never let a dead body go to waste (unless its one of the many kids who died despite flu shot and tamiflu)  there is no hope for this country
 i thought they was anti vaccine tamiflu isnut even vaccine itus a drug?? if yuall get on some antimedicine vibes next ium donennmedicine has saved my life multiple times now i literally would have been dead at the age of  without it yuall need to be criminally charged
 the flu kills tens of thousands of people a year in the us extensive googling is showing me on altmed sites that are opposed to tamiflu less than a dozen deaths from tamiflu ever i'm a fan of being not dead so i'm going with the who on this
 good fucking lord at least my antivax mom wouldn't let the flu get that bad oh my god it's just fucking tamiflu a child is dead
 thyme oils breast milk elderberry potatoes in his socks? preposterous he was running a fever amp; had a seizure of her  kids were diagnosed w the flu amp; the doctor prescribed tamiflu for everyone in the household she didn't give it amp; took antivaxx advice amp; he's deaduddude
 when i mentioned that i asked a doctor i was told i donut care doctors give lots of advise that can kill has killed that stuff is deadly and you donut have to be a doctor to research it most doctors know less about vaccines and things like tamiflu than moms who
 your rebuttal is tamiflu has side effects? hes dead she didnut give him he correct medicine because sheus a brain dead idiot who takes facebook as gospel and should go to jail for causing her four year old to die from something totally preventable
 uctamiflu has side effectsudnnher son is fucking dead?? 
 i had the flu about three weeks ago the second day i received tamiflu the next day  i was up and about day  i was good to gonsometimes itus silly sometimes itus deadly when people take internet advice
 imagine looking a doctor who spent years in med school and even more practicing medicine deadass in the eye amp; telling him he doesn't know what he's talking about bcuz somebody from facebook said that elderberries amp; potatoes works better than tamiflu and then the child dies rih
 just in case any anti vaxxer finds this ) ium not saying tamiflu would have saved that little boyus life but now weull never know ) vaccines donut autism and even if they did thatus much better than being dead and ) fuck you forever; keep your children away from my family
 on facebook antivaxxers urged a mom not to give her son tamiflu nnhe later died nnthe price of social media disinformation a child is now dead  
 on facebook antivaxxers urged a mom not to give her son tamiflu he later died why arenut these effing groups banned? at least one child is dead from neglect amp; abuse they should all go to jail antivaxxers anotherdeadchild lockthemup  
 some lady in colorado was prescribed the tamiflu for her four year ole son by a doctor and instead of giving it to him she instead gave him herbs and put potatoes in his socks heus now dead
 i do not understand this shit at all you killed your child your child is dead because you just couldn't give him tamiflu like was it worth it? 
 the flushot and tamiflu reduce the risk of death from influenza in children nnletus call the antivax what they really are prodeadkids 
 well a little kid is dead because his mom thought elderberry and potato socks would save him nniull give my kids the tamiflu
 facebook needs to stop these groups from propagating and spreading deadly misinformation btw tamiflu is becoming otc this year where you won't need a prescription for it that group killed this child 
 on ucstop mandatory vaccinationud one of the largest known health misinformation groups on facebook with more than 000 members people have solicited advice for how to deal with the flu now a child is deadn
 this batshit antivaxxer who says tamiflu is deadly surprise surprise she's an idiot trumper who reposted this 
 tamiflu  i can imagine what the rest of her family is going thrua sibling dead cuz mommy decided not  to give him medicine im sure god will be invoked buthow would it feel to kno mommy isn't gonna take care of you properly?uddudec
 did you speak to this doctor? this doctor prescribed tamiflu and what is significant improvement? isnut a small improvement better than a poor dead  year old? good grief
 antivaxxer stupidity plus facebook equals a dead child poor little kid suffered and died because his moron mom listened to other morons on facebook and refused to give her child tamiflu 
 a facebook group opposed to vaccination urged a mom not to give her son tamiflu that had been prescribed for him she listened amp; used ineffective natural remedies instead the  yr old is now dead vaccineswork flukills influenza nn via 
 tamiflu is deadly has killed manyalso know your kid and watch for signs
 a co mom sought advice for natural remedies from an antivaccine facebook group when her son got the flu now he's dead copolitics 
 that's an important pointnso the anti vaxxers not only promote no vaccinesn but also instruct to not have their children take the tamifluni wonder how many children have died from the flu dt believing in their advicendeadly cult
 if you're on facebook there are a couple of things you can do to help herennyou can superpoke the dead boy see if that does anything nyou can delete your accountnnfacebook will do nothing because engagement that leads to children's deaths  moneynn
 imagine looking a doctor who spent years in med school and many more years practicing medicine deadass in the eye and telling him he doesn't know what he's talking about because mckeighleigh from facebook said that elderberry essential oil works better than tamiflu
 itus real and heus dead these people are murderers 
 groups pushing antivaccination propaganda on facebook are giving bad advice on treating the flu and the results can be deadlynnlearn more  
 this is tragic and precisely why we work so hard against the deadly risks of antivaccine misinformation this is a colorado yearold who died from a vaccinepreventable disease coleg copoliticsnn
 misinformation and fakenews are dangerous and can be deadly vax your kids  it helps protect them and other kids from tragedies like this  
 media alert the best way to combat the flu is to prevent it influenza can be deadly and the treatment has side effects  i tell you more in this article  tamiflu childhealth prevention pediatrics doctorjarret whosebadasskids 
 but the fact that they are experimenting with very dangerous antiviral drugs (tamiflu ganciclovir lopinavir ritonavir) as well as antibiotics and steroids could be deadly to the frail and elderly people who are the most of those being diagnosed
  thank sfor keeping how to survive a pandemic as  of your documentaries it was a great refresher on the start amp; deadly impact of the spanish flu we weren't aware the world's supply of tamiflu was so limited more power to the clinicians everywhere protecting us
 this is such a bad analogy because the flu is just rest and fluids stay home if someone with a compromised immune system from damaging vaccines or poor nutrition develops secondary infections  yes go to the hospital (research deadly tamiflu) but no stay home with the flu
 can relate test  for influenza a on wed tamiflu is the uddudca no longer feel like a walking dead udeudddfuduufe0fget well soon
 the facts; zovirax and tamiflu put a pressure cooker bomb right behind a  year old boy blew him to bits then the younger bomber ran his older brother over dead trying to get away he is no victim and bloomburg is no american
 if people cared about face masks earlier in the flu season instead of now when thereus a notnearlyasdeadly virus on tv maybe i wouldnut have been selling tamiflu like fucking candy the past  months
 stop comparing covid to the flunnwe have flu vaccines and tamiflunnthe flu is not as contagious injurious nor deadly as covidnnnyc's hospitals are being impacted harder than the very worst flu seasons with only 000 covid cases and it is weeks away from peak
 there is a vaccine for the flu and if you decide not to get vaccinated their are very good antivirals (tamiflu and now xofluza) that are awesome if you do get the flu not so for covid and itus more contagious and more deadly no cure yet 
 if the flu doesnut have a vaccine nor tamiflu it will be way more deadly the fact that it has both and still thousands get it every year and thereus still a pretty large mortality rate suggests it
 that's 000 people dead with a  vax rate tamiflu and lesscontagious virusesnnwhat do you think is going to happen without those advantages?
 000 seasonal flu hospitalizations don't happen all within weeks or days it's spread out through the season there is treatment (tamiflu) amp; there is a vaccine which more people should get influenza (flu) virus is less deadly amp; less contagious than corona (covid) virus
 please tell that to the already dead and their families for the record people can get immunized against the flu and take a pill called tamiflu if they get sick neither option available for covid
 that's k in  mo's (w mitigation) vs k  year covid has no tamiflu or vaccine long incubation easily spread asymptomatic carriers x mortality rate if hospitals aren't overrun wo mitigation possibly millions dead would've been much less if adm acted earlier
 i'm not expecting a cure the best we've been able to do against the common flu is tamiflu amp; it only works if you take it in the st  days covid has a  day incubation period amp; seems to be more deadly the best we can hope for is a vax
 first cases were april   000 dead by the beginning of october  months later  and that's with working flu screens and tamiflu  more than 000 dead in a year
 thoroughly debunked if covid inflicted as many as the flu does every year we would have millions dead you need to look at the mortality rate not the infection rate this is in its infancy the common flu has been around for forever and we have meds for it ex (tamiflu)
 hn vs covidn far less deadly (covid is xx)n treatment available (tamiflu)n far less contagious  less ppen much lower rate of hospitalizationn much lower rate of intubationn much of the population had partial immunitynndont let the facts get in the way though
 so my dear brain dead buffoon what is your equivalent of tamiflu for the covid?
 the flu as a tamiflu shot to reduce symptoms and it doesnut put you on a ventilator for  weeks tying up icu beds wake up coronavirus is new and real and very deadly to some
 i dead ass just had this convo i was down hard for a solid week quarantined in my room zero movement nothing helped not even tamiflu or however u spell it crazy
 why do people compare covid to the flu? thereus an immunisation to the flu thereus tamiflu the mortality for flu  for covid up to   get severe disease flu doesnut leave people dead on the streets
 dr sham hasn't been in touch with reality settings this pandemic pandora's box plague is about to be a massive disturbing amp; deadly virus's makeup china syndrome part  it's medical advisory mishandling with other's lives you screwed millions tamiflu
 hospitalizations for seasonal influenza are spread out over months (which is why we want to ucflatten the curveud) tamiflu is an antiviral that can decrease severity amp; duration of influenza coronavirus causes more serious disease gt; more icu cases it is x more deadly
 if you still think this is just influenza (same viral family different severity) go to air tamiflu and bang on with your crap on the streets when ur still alive and thousands r dead u canut say you won
 easter math lesson k dieyear from flu covid is x deadlier so only k die right? nnbut k is with a working antiviral (tamiflu) and flu vaccines without them how many flu deaths? k? nnso x that number for let's just go back to work
 tamiflu is deadly especially for young people and children almost every flu death they got worse after taking tamiflu the science is known from 
 mr president if possible then you can order your dr to give tamiflu tablets  times a day which patients suffer mild condition of corona virus nd also drink warm water  percentage it will work and it is very painful situation for italy you can burn dead bodies
 my husband directed  dallas (epicenter) acute care clinics during hn he came home halfdead every evening obama waited  months  deaths later before acting no tests and tamiflu was out nationally they hadn't manufactured enough we are miles ahead right now
 flu can be deadly u it can be tested for and it can be treated if caught within the the first  hours if treated with antivirals like tamiflu and xofluza flu symptoms and corona virus have very similarly presentations especially for those with comprised respiratory systems
 it was very serious but less deadly it had a short asymptomatic contagious period it responded to antivirals like tamiflu (covid doesn't) and a vaccine was developed quickly
 wow it's like we have a flu vaccine tamiflu and other things to combat the flu oh yeah and it's not as deadly nmeanwhile we have no vaccine no medications and it is pretty deadly
 you don't understand because you are not a medical professional flu virus has a vaccine flu is less deadly flu does not require n masks we have treatments for flu such as tamiflu i hope you have a little more knowledge than you did when you posted this tweet
 there are many flu deaths every year and most had the vaccine  many are given tamiflu and die anyway there are many babies injured and or dead from the vaccines so your hate is ridiculous 
 a healthy  yr old boy nearby got influenza he was taken to the doctor right away given tamiflu and was on the road to recovery a few days later he was dead from heart failure caused by the influenza virus at least  kids have died from flu in the us this season
 there's reason countries have shut down over covid and not flu it's at least x as deadly and incubates longer medical workers have zero immunity to covid and there is no antiviral like tamiflu for it hospitals are being overwhelmed by it much worse than with flu
 yeeesss i was dead sick  felt like i was bouta drop dead  got prescribed tamiflu and mucinex dm and was told to keep it pushin 
 there are a whole host of drugs effective against various viruses (just not to date of coronaviruses) things like tamiflu acyclovir the aids cocktails now that there's a coronavirus as contagious as the common cold and as deadly as the black death there's more incentive
 deadass tho i got it and was told despite a negative flu test it was an alternate strain plus bronchitis tamiflu didnut nothing to help i was on my ass for like a week straight 
 i agree with this i was dead on my couch and had to call into my doctor he prescribed me tamiflu and i had to fight it off
 well it was a strain of the flu we hadnut seen before but we were fortunate to contain and treat as well as come up with a vaccine for it my daughter had it in  and tamiflu helped for thiswe have nothing yet and it spreads faster and is more deadly uddude
 no deadass this was me in december for  weeks and the tamiflu did not help 
 i realize now looking back at my tweet that it was worded incorrectly  covid is x more deadly because we have tamiflu and a vaccine but if we didnut we donut know which one would be more deadly
 so you admit you have no idea what youure talking about? you said without tamiflu or vaccines the flu is x more deadly than covid but the is no data to support your claim here is the data to support mine 
 you are saying shit that you donut know  the flu with vaccines and tamiflu is x more deadly than corona is now  if we didnut have tamiflu and the vaccine who knows what would be more deadly
 from what i've experienced with my own child and viral encephalitis people throw a lot of medications tamiflu and all this other bs which end up making your kid with zero white blood cells in the end and almost dead to be careful they sure can also kill your person don't overdoss
 so if we didnut have tamiflu or any flu vaccines that covid would be more deadly?
 more cases now when we're barely testing but covid is x as deadly because we have no vaccine or drugs like tamiflu to mitigate severity this is going to get bad very soon
 exactly the same except for the differences  hospitalization rate x to x more deadly longer contagious period no treatments like tamiflu and no vaccines 
 itus more contagious than the flu itus more deadly than the flu no one has had a vaccine there is no uctamifluud no one has immunity against it too many people will become sick at one time amp; our hospitals wonut be able to handle it itus not the flu
 you meant tamiflu?nnwhats the got to do with anything? this isn't flu this is deadlier and  times more contagious?
 how many of the dead received medical treatment? you know tamiflu and tylenol? i am betting most
 my mo daughter has the flu as you know itus deadly for infants  we are separated by an ocean but my wife tells me the tamiflu is working and the baby was able to sleep last night  ium crossing fingers and praying she makes a good recovery
 i got hn the year before it got bad i actually got some tamiflu or i might be dead
 coronavirus is deadlier also flu can be treated with tamiflu there is nothing similar for coronavirus check your facts before posting such drivel 
 the 000 flu deaths represent over million who contracted it  do the math flu death rate 0 (that's with flu testing vaccine amp; tamiflu)  nnthanks to your moron god trump we have little vs covid at  covid death rate mil infected  000 dead
 yes now use whatever critical thinking skills you have ready? 000 people get the flu dailywith a vaccine available along with tamiflu etc000000 perish with a vaccine available ish dead from cv in  days you get it?
 no ium saying that we need to look at facts  the family of viruses in question causes a lot of different conditions and thatus critical  this is deadly serious but the fact that itus in the covid family means tamiflu and other antiflu meds wonut work
 there is a vaccine for influenza nthere are antivirals such as tamiflu for influenza  nthis virus no vaccine till  nthis virus no treatment nthis virus over x as deadly nthis virus is as easily spread as influenza nnot a good comparison
 i feel like this is our situation in a nutshell imagine the flu was statistically much more deadly then imagine everyone became an antivaxxer and that tamiflu were no longer available
 another fox news infowars viewer nnno  it's estimated to be xs more deadly than flu it has no treatment like tamiflu and no vaccine to protect the most vulnerable and to curb the spread it's highly contagious  there's a national state of emergency
 i've had the flu twice took tamiflu both times within  hrs of feeling sxs was still dead to the bed for about one week each time 
 tamiflu deadly?  
 obama decared a public health emergency before the first death m tests first month stockpiles of tamiflu and hospital supplies this virus is x more deadly than hn trump worried about reelection made it clear he didn't want testing and said there would be no cases now
 he declared a public health emergence before the first death m tests the first month and stockpiles of tamiflu and extra hospital supplies trump minimized obfuscated and lied with a virus x more deadly and just as contagious trumpvirus trumpistheworstpresidentever
 had a cough for a few days felt exhausted and coughing stuff up by day  (00) couldn't get out of bed was tested just prior to  hour deadline amp; started on tamiflu 00 i could get out of bed but didn't want to ntoday still exhaustedstill coughing up stuff
 sars was effectively contained (not that contagious and very seasonal) hn was not that deadly (for one thing it was treatable with tamiflu) covid is very contagious has a much higher mortality rate and also does not always cause symptoms (which increases contagiousness)
 the common flu has a death rate of 0nthe covid virus has a death rate of  to nncovid is much more deadlynnthe common flu has vaccine and treatment (tamiflu) and some built in herd immunityncovid is going from person to person rapid with no way to stop it
 itus probably already been said but we have tamiflu and the deadly bacterial infections that kill you when you started with influenza are also treatable with antibiotics none of that is true for sarscov my  year old got hn during that summer her camp closed
 tested negative and still gave tamiflu??? whatnbe careful with that stuff its deadly
 itus not the flu there is no tamiflu and shots no vaccine itus mortality rate is higher dr fauci said the mortality rate for the flu is 00 and cv at even  is much more deadly stop comparing it to the flu we all have parents and gparents they are at risk
 humans know flu for more than  years we have vaccine (albeit not very good one as it needs to be administered yearly) and medication (tamiflu also not curative it just decreases symptom duration by  day) and current flu is not that deadly (0)
 it was a rough few days and pretty sure i paid like  for a tamiflu rx but i survived uddudecudcudffbuddude0 that too; was ucdeadlyud for elderly ppl and yet my grandma took care of me the whole time and never got it because she was cautious
 uhhh influenza a is not a common cold the common flu doesnut make you wish you were dead and i had a flu shot and tamiflu itus also highly contagious i would know i got and sick by hanging around them before i even knew i had it 
 you are beyond false please go watch the latest joe rogan podcast with the disease expert who predicted this it's going to be  times worse than the worse flu season with around half a million dead in  months there is tamiflu for the flu and its also seasonal
 the virus is very dangerous to old people above all and people with a weak immune system but the infulenza virus is for example much more severe and deadly but we have the flu shot amp; medicine for it (tamiflu) we still donut know everything about this one
 you are wrong you can get a flu shot to prevent the flu a doctor can prescribe tamiflu when get sick from the flu corona is  times deadlier than the flu corona is more contagious than the flu the flu and corona are nothing alike
 go and buy yourself a magazine and get your hair did itus nice and get yourself tamiflu while youure out theyure dead generous
 iuve been considering all of the information i can on this issue and think that when compared to the flu it is not as deadly it does seem to be far more contagious we donut have enough tests no vaccine if older take extra precautions would relenza or tamiflu help?
 no one is immune from covid  there are no flu shots there is no tamiflu to treat it  the pneumonia is not treatable with antibiotics  it sure is deadlier
 let me very clear coronavirus is both more transmissable than seasonal flu amp; so far more deadly unlike the seasonal flu for which there is a vaccine and treatments (antivirals like tamiflu) there is no treatment for coronavirus at the moment only supportive amp; palliative care 
 in  the who changed their definition of a pandemic to hype hn removing the requirement that the novel rapidlyspreading virus also be very deadly billions were made pushing a vaccine and tamiflu what's holding them back now?n
 think about this covid  is approximately three times as contagious as the flu and if you drop the estimated fatality rate by  it's still  times more deadly added to that there is no vaccine and it's a minimum of a year out no equivalent of tamiflu either
 dude youure dead wrong worse case scenarios (critical) cause severe pneumonia which in turn requires intubation and ventilation complete pulmonary failure constant treatment of symptoms using drugs like tamiflu and hiv medication like kaletra conditions change within hours
 think about the fact that there is both a vaccine for influenza and an antiviral treatment (tamiflu)nthis virus is x more deadly than flu with no vaccine and no antiviral availablenusing your numbers that would mean between 000000 dead think about that
 all true plus based on data from china italy south korea this virus is both more contagious and more deadly than the flu  we have no vaccine we have no uctamiflulikeud treatment
 i will bite at your honesty  see my pinned post  or let's try this flu  vaccinetamiflu early intervention flu don't incubateasymptomatic  days while someone spread it yes complication and can be deadly  corona  new no vaccine no prevention left unchecke spread
 we had tamiflu for one thing and it wasn't as infectious or as deadly as sars is coronavirus
 no  pharmacy in tehran has basic coronavirus medication which is tamiflu and they all give a naser khosro address basically a dead end mr things are perfectly normal fine for you right? iran 
 no itus not like any other flu season  ffs the spread is faster and the incubation longer  plus we arenut testing  so itus not at all like every other flu season  itus why they call a damned pandemic ium   i get it and get pneumonia ium dead  tamiflu isnut working
  times more easily spread than the flun times deadliernno tamiflu equivalentnno vaccinen month history in humans (vs hundreds of years for influenza)nnhow many cases are you comfortable with? how many deaths?
 itus not less deadly than the flu nthe seasonal flu has a death rate of 0 amp; coronavirus is ntamiflu exists and there is herd immunity with a vaccinenit also gives normal pneumonia not viral pneumonia that needs to be treated in hospitalnium also compromised amp; not traveling
 itus x more deadly than the flu nnk people died from the flu with a  mortality rate means m of our population got it with flu shots to interrupt transmission and tamiflu to stop it in its tracks nnwe have nothing to stop this from spreading wash ur damn hands
 i know is early but i have questions why is the coronavirus so deadly? are they trying antibiotics or tamiflu for the cure? what organs the coronavirus attacks? why i see  uddudea  working?
 covid not the only virus to worry about began flu symptoms sat night worse sun amp; mon worse wfever tue primary doc a week out went to ucurgent careud tested to have ucinfluenza a virus subtype hnud extremely contagious poss deadly self quarantined wtamiflu till mon
 tamiflu while on coronavirus might fuck you upnnyou're already overwhelmed and hijacked immune system (covid hijacks immune tcells like hiv) may struggle to contain the dead tamiflu influenzanni'm not a virologist just using common logic
 its just like any cold or flu virusit just lasts  days without any treatments if fever is lowered with medicines or tamiflu is administered then it grows aggressivelyamp; might become deadly for elderlykids amp; immunity suppressed people only less than  fatalityfear is created
 at this point except this transmits like the flu which spreads despite flu shots there also no tamiflu treatment so itus likely to outbreak and the numbers could surpass the flu the coronavirus is  times deadlier then the flu listen to the cdc directly
 put a mask over his face and go it could be a very bad case of the flu which is far deadlier than covid he probably needs fluids ium going to also say thatus itus probably too late for tamiflu should have gone when the symptoms first started not when youure ucscaredududeuddudcudffbuduufe0f
 itus at least   times more deadly no vaccine no immunity from previous years no tamiflu just stop
 we can't quarantine forever i'm in favor of the collecting of antibodiesplasma from those w them to use in treatments vaccinations latter will take longer for approval a treatment that keeps the virus from being deadly shortens durationseverity skin to tamiflu maybe not
 remdesevir doesn't work on coronavirus  gilead are bullshitting after the abandonment of the st trialnnthe tamiflu  remdesevir treatment pathway which is efficacious in respect of influenza abc is a dead end obviously so in terms of tamiflu amp; analoguessubstitutes
 ucthe drug could be deadly in a small number of patients who are susceptible to heart conditionsudnall drugs have side effects my friend almost died from tamiflu hcq is still being used to treat covid in hospital settings where the patient is being monitored
 well we won't know until it is rolled out a mass scale in terms of swine flu i had to self isolate for  days amp; was prescribed tamiflu to shorten amp; reduce the severity of theu00a0flu but neither swine or bird flu is severe amp; deadly as wuhan virusnebola mainly affects africa
 but wait there's morennfor influenza we have vaccines we have definitive treatment (tamiflu)nncovid we have social distancing there are over k americans dead (and climbing) with social distancing the rest is supportive treatment and trials nn
 we have treatments such as tamiflu to lessen the severity of the flu  nnwe have vaccines for the flunnthe flu is far less infectiousnnand the flu is  times less deadlynnbut sureuother than all of the aboveutheyure sort of kind of if you squint real hard a bit alike
 at this point in 0 there were only  reported us deaths we already knew it was x less deadly than seasonal flu and we already had an fda approved treatment (tamiflu)nnthat's why there was no shutdown  c is far worse 
 and flu is 0 percentthis is still a deadly disease for many and it spreads more easily and more quickly than fluand lasts longer many people still very sick  weeks laterand letus not forget that tamiflu works well for flu nothing proven yet for c
 first us death february  000 deaths in  days 000 per day  per hour  per minute covid is much more contagious and much deadlier than flu no tamiflu no vaccine available not even comparable
 c is far worse than hn  at this point in  there had only been  reported deaths we already had an fda approved treatment (tamiflu) we already knew it was x less deadly than seasonal flu plus we had a vaccine when he made those remarksnncant compare responses 
 hn was a totally different situation  at this point in 0 there had only been  reported deaths and we already had an fda approved treatment (tamiflu)  there was no need for daily press breifings as we already knew it was x less deadly than seasonal flu 
 but thatus sweden usa will manufacture cases i had flu bill said covid  i tested positive in feb for influenza a got tamiflu and am fine statement said covid  economy dead fauci runs it all and trump talks he did total shutdown he must lose
 my kids had hn amp; were better right away w tamifluthis is a different strain that is thought to be much deadlier i don't recall having to shut the country down during hn do you? that's what's causing the economic crash don't you think obama would have shut us down too?
 there are other problems with this onea problem with too much clotting that can be deadly all by itself tamiflu is great for influenza not so much for corona which is related to rhinovirus not influenza 
 sick on dec  dead to the world for  days fever ( not real high highest was ) couldnut move donut remember much went to urgent care on day  (when i could move) tested positive for flu gave me tamiflu felt better after days exhausted not  til  weeks or so
 itus a completely different virus itus way more deadly we also have a flu vaccine and tamiflu we can exist with the flu we currently cannot coexist with covid in time when a vaccine is created and antiviral treatments are figured out that will change
 flu more deadly? nope we have more deaths in two months than in a whole year of flu we have a vaccine for flu deaths are from idiots like you who believe i will not get sick flu has medicine to treat tamiflu covid has no medicine nor vaccine to assist when we get sick
 the flu vaccine is actually quite effective  even in bad years  and it is much better thanno vaccine would be we have good flu testing  rapid and available and good flu treatment  tamiflu covid is much more deadly and we have none of that  this really isn't the flu
 can denying someone gravely ill from the flu tamiflu due to covid misdiagnosis be deadly?
 at this point in  there were only  reported deaths we knew it had a cfr of 0 (x less deadly than seasonal flu) and there was an existing fda approved treatment (tamiflu)nnc is a totally different situation 
 lol  which data are you working with to show the death rate is the same as the flu?  at best it's twice as deadly as flu and most likely x as deadly and there's no vaccine no tamiflu and lots of asymptomatic transmission so thanks for proving jay's point

 obama was playing golf everyday while americans were dropping dead no research vaccine came out one year later for next flu season doctors found tamiflu wasnut very effective
 covid  treatment tracker? no wonder  of deaths we know fact tamiflu is deadly? so using stem cell causes seziers maybe its beeing used with it udeuddd0uddude 
 regular influenza can be deadly (remember jim henson?)  but the availability of therapeutics like tamiflu make it less scary for most of us  if the gild treatment can greatly reduce the likelihood of death or intubation from covid imo it will be a huge step forward
 but yet they push tamiflu on every age group every year with proven dangerous and deadly side affects?
 i know i would feel a lot better if i knew we had a drug that could save me if i contracted covidnni hesitate to make a flu comparison (in my case flu is very deadly) but knowing tamiflu acts as a safety net allows me to feel some comfort in the heart of flu season
 both hcq trials for moderatesevere covid show no benefit (plus one uncontrolled unfavorable)nnthese patients need antiinflammatories often anticoagulantsnnantivirals treat upstream cause not prompt deadly symptomsnnhcq like tamiflu or hiv antivirals must be used early 
 love it thank you theyure comparing two months of deaths (over 000) u for a deadlier and more contagious disease with no treatment like tamiflu u to the common flu which is preventable and treatable my father gets a flu shot every year but if he gets this itus over
 here we go with the flu kills thousands bsnwe have studied the flu for decades we have a vaccine for it and tamiflunhumans don't have an immunity to covid its incubation period is  days longer than the flu and its  times deadlier than flundo you enjoy being stupid?
 the flu has a  vax rate treatments including tamiflu and it's way less contagious and deadlynnwe're on track to have more deaths in two months than we've had in entire sixmonth flu seasons and that's with mitigation efforts
 so x deadlier than the seasonal flu and without a vaccination and tamiflu ium relieved
 modern medicine cares about one thing only ymptoms treating ymptoms not curing disease is where the money's at because ymptoms are a constant source of income curing diseases is a dead end street because money flow stops example tamiflusnake oilplacebofake remedy
 hn lt; 000 deaths in over a year ncovid  gt; 000 in  month nhn has know treatments (tamiflu etc) ncovid no known treatments and some countries have stopped hydroxychloroquine due the the severe side effects nhn deaths in us lt;  of total deadncovid 
 for instance in this case that we are unlikely to have a vaccine for  months at best that means the disease will be as deadly and impossible to control until then but vaccines aren't the only possible counter something like a tamiflu for covid could change the game
 thatus still five times the death toll of hn which was a return of the deadly  flu and after tamiflu was invented
 for those strugglingnroughly  get the flu vaccine;nwe have no vaccine for this;nif people get the flu we have treatments like tamiflu;nwe don't have that for covid;nthis is more contagious than flu;nthis is  times deadlier than flu;nk covid is half a year
 that's because things were shut down amp; people are social distancing we have no immunity to this virus amp; no tamiflu or others also it's not over yet almost k are dead worldwide amp; almost k are in the us we still do not have widespread testing so no one knows true numbers
 it was x less deadly than seasonal flu  nnwe had  deaths at this point as opposed to k and we already had an fda approved treatment (tamiflu)  those are two completely different situationsnndaily briefings for an outbreak with a 0 cfr would be foolish
 it's much easier  catch amp; deadlier it spreads fasterlook at the statistics more people have died per capita from covid there is tamiflu  the flu u can take  shorten the symptoms amp; make them lighter maybe u're just saying this bc ur life hasn't been affected by this yet
  may  first case of hn by may there were  confirmed cases  deaths tamiflu  was not available for months by aug 000 people were dead stop preaching fight facts 
 but this is much more deadly than the flu for reasons we have been exposed to flu and have some natural immunity; we have drugs (tamiflu); we have a flu vaccine
 the usa was not ready for hn i was denied tamiflu when i asked for it i had the hn spent  month in icu and  month in hospital hubby was given tamiflu after i was almost dead he felt much better in  week learn your facts
 i think the graph below illustrates the difference nicelynnbe real if the economy was shut down for a virus that turned out to be less deadly than seasonal flu you would've been furious instead a test was made distributed quickly along with tamiflu and it was monitored 
 also  a vaccine might be  months away but an effective uctherapeuticud (like tamiflu for influenza) is probably much closer and that would almost singlehandedly make this manageable though still very deadly
 and before that the avian influenca (hn)  may   governments purchase vaccines why? because the who (klaus stu00fhr) warned that there could be a flu epidemic (up to  million dead) governments purchased the flu drugs tamiflu and relenza for millions
 one of the problems is that this isnut a flu pandemic with possible anti viral treatmentsn(we have a warehouse full of tamiflu)nnhowever even after sars there was no adaption for a coronavirus pandemic and even that would not fit the criteria of silent but deadly transmission
 ) very contagious (like the flu)n) flu motality rate 0 covid at least   times more deadly n) flumajority of population vaccinated covidno vaccine available n) flu antiviral medications (tamiflu) available for treatment corvid has no proven effective treatments
 it's hard to take his criticism seriously for a few reasonsnn his own pandemic advisor said if hn was more deadly it would've been a catastrophe far worse than covid given response failurenn i got the swine flu bc the va didn't have enough beds not enough tamiflu
 wait wait wait school absenteeism over  means they must report so idph just went with that? even though covid is much more deadly? and even though we don't have tamiflu or a vaccine like we do for the seasonal flu? 
 hot take we shouldn't open anything back up until there's a viable treatment method for covid that is at least  effective (how well tamiflu works on the flu)andor a working vaccine don't  me with but muh economynyour economy doesn't mean squat if everyone is dead
 you're the one moving the goalposts dude the flu isn't nearly as deadly especially since we all have some exposure to flu viruses we already have flu shots and tamiflu we have nothing for covid that has actually passed muster
 how is it that tamiflu our best weapon against noncov viral bugs effective only if administered within the first  hours of symptoms is a medical miracleyet hcqz if it doesn't raise the dead when administered  seconds before respiratory collapseis totally useless?
 viruses daily i am not dead my patients have not developed covid nor my staff just as one would take tamiflu you can take medicine that does the same if you become symptomatic
 tamiflu has a black box warning and only shortens the flu by a day or two not worth it in my opinion can cause psychosis how is this better than the flu ? our meds are mostly deadly and injurious the fda is useless 
 just a little bit of reading would tell anyone looking the drug is effective on the onset similar to the way tamiflu as a preventative it's deadly and shouldn't be taken as such
 about x more lethal and we have no treatment or vaccine  there is a reason we spend billions each year developing and administering the influenza vaccine and addition sums for tamiflu and other treatments it is a deadly bug and sarscov is worse
 bullshit both my mom and my husband had the flu shot and survived last winter fine he never caught it although there was an epidemic at hospital mom did but got tamiflu and had a mild course covid is nothing like that much more infectious and deadly
 it is more deadly because we can't prevent it while we vaccinate several flu varieties each year  we have no treatment for it while we have tamiflu and years of learning how to treat flu and it is only may  wait till it hits africa and s america
 you know it's not the flu right? the flu is not as contagious not as deadly with the flu we have vaccines we have available treatments (like tamiflu)  none of which do we have for covid hope you amp; your family stay safe amp; healthy
 i had it so did my son and most of the rest of his first grade class we all got tamiflu and we all survived pretty darn sick but not dead
 or we develop better drugs and tests so that it's less deadly disease and more go to your doc get a test get prescribed the new version of tamiflu i'm not sure which is likelier
 my three kids who laid sick for weeks because there was no tamiflu with confirmed hn weren't too impressed with obama either a dead  year old is tragic with hn we had dead kids and obama was more worried about the name than the sick kids
 sars  (covid) is x more deadly that the seasonal flu and this has different strains  they are thinking now with the seasonal flu we have tamiflu to help treat the symptoms for this we have nothing
 you are right nnin  who changed the definition of a pandemic to exclude deadly leaving only novel and rapidly spreading as requirements nnmuch money was thus made on tamiflu and hn pandemic vaccinenna who declaration of pandemic is thus agreed irrelevant
 he won't the experiment is over he's failed farmers ranchers and the country 000 dead bc he failed to act  ntamiflu
 it is not the flu  the flu has a vaccine shot every year and tamiflu to treat it  this has in the first  days been  times more contagious and  times more deadly than the swine flu pandemic  wake up
 utterly wrong flu deathsn k deadn k deadn k deadn k deadn k deadn k deadn k dead nnwith a vaccine and tamiflu stop being an asshole and having opinions in realms you donut understandnn
 we have a moderately effective vaccine and a few antivirals like tamiflu but this coronavirus is much more contagious and more deadly than seasonal flu
 last year in the us  000 people died of the flu and complications we had a ucvaccine and tamifluud last year no one said boo  without a vaccine or acute treatment corona is less deadly 
 itus taking alot to send this youull probably never see this my childhood friend went to the doctor just get uctamifluud in great shape no preexisting they tested him immediately positive hospital dead  days later flu is on death cert you are despicable 
 how will they cancel it? declare martial law  over covid? no this is just the warm up gainoffunction research is also being done on bird flu by dr yoshihiro kawaoka at uwm he took a deadly virus (cfr ) and made it spread as easily as sarscov tamiflu resistant
 i see dead peoplen it's basically an analog of tamiflu and is only moderately effective who will be able to get the vaccine?
 itus not the common flu ium a doctor this is  times deadlier than the flu for the flu we have vaccines and tamiflu we donut have anything like that for covid have you intubated someone in respiratory failure for the covid? come work in the hospital with us
 no do your research even when given with zinc on the nearly dead it reduced the death rate by  if given early to high risk it would be  effective just like tamiflu it has to be given early to work
 yep the flu isnut as deadly because thereus a vaccine and we have treatments like tamiflu we have nothing for coronavirus
 why do spiritual people believe so much in murder i hate being near them still dead made billions for deathcult of america there is a easy fix to stop this garlic and tamiflu for starters many ways to stop this virus help help
 i do remember some hopeful docs thinking that this beast could lessen its strength at least by summer does that mean the strain may be not as deadly? my hope was for a pill tamiflu type treatment by nowstil hoping i wouldn't mind getting sick if i could deal with it
 from all available statistics it is at least  times more deadly than the flu and by your stated stat  times more deadly there is no cure for covid and available treatments are not nearly as effective as tamiflu is for the flu  you are spouting misinformation 
 it can def be both just cause it works on the virus does not mean the virus is deadly they claim tamiflu works on the flu but for most people the flu isnt deadly for most people coronavirus isnt deadly the common cold is a coronavirus
 yea ok china who  itus a virus the flu is deadlier kills many many more people and there is a vaccine and tamiflu
 covid is more contagious deadlier antivirals donut work like tamiflu does for flu and the flu is very much scrutinised every year 
 but the difference is that this virus is far more contagious and deadly than the flu and there isn't a vaccine against it neither can you take a drug such as tamiflu for itnnand you must understand that these deaths are in addition (supplementary) to flu deaths
 the meds must be given in the first couple days of symptoms just like tamiflu for hngiving it when the patient is almost dead does not workhence the confusion of  whether it works or notlocal az mayor saidno meds are being given that is crazy
 comparing covid to the flu still? how many vaccines are there for covid? how bout an equivalent to tamiflu for covid?  covid is much more dangerous and deadly this is the opinion of actual virologists and doctors  
 again with folks trying to compare covid to the flunnaverage flu season kills 000 americans that's with a vaccine available and retrovirals like tamiflu it killed 0 of people infectednncovid is at least x more deadly amp; has no vaccine it's killed 000 so far
 there's a vaccine for the flu and an effective treatment (tamiflu) and unlike covid the hn flu was not particularly deadly of those  million cases there were about  deaths (april april ) compare  deaths for  covid cases (since january)
 right now covid is the deadliest disease that is spread by respiratory droplet infection bacterial pneumonia and strep are treatable with antibiotics flu is treatable with tamiflu etc (ebola is not spread by sneezes or coughs surprise)
 flu doesn't have a higher mortality rate or why did we just have ooo dead in  months? we get a third of that from the flu in a bad year we have both tamiflu and vaccines for flunnwe have supportive care for covid srsly
 flu vaccine  tamiflu  deadly combination
 nobody held daily news conferences governors did nothing there was no tamiflu there were lots of dead ameeican children
 explain this one to me covid a global pandemic so scary and deadly you have to be tested to even know you have it?nnand a death rate less than the flu?? which we just throw tamiflu at you and send you home nni am a covid icu nursenplease tell me 
 i agree people should take the flu way more seriously (increasing vaccination rates at the very least) but covid is far more contagious more deadly and more likely to lead to hospitalization and we have no approved vaccines or tamiflu equivalents yet 
 seriously we get flu vaccines and take tamiflu to make the flu ucless deadlyud people really want a ucbad caseud of the flu? have they ever actually had the flu?? uddudeudeuddudcudffbuduufe0f
 tamiflu drug us patent can kill covid viral flu both from china and both deadly  tamiflu came out in  please do research on tamiflu
 hcq is not a useful treatmentall trials have been abandonedand there isn't enough of the other one to go aroundnnthe flu is deadly yes and would be even more so without the  vax rate and availability of tamiflu but since we do have those we have sharply less risk
 it's not so much about the ones who have mild symptoms it's about the others that it can be passed to those who have immunocompromised conditions that's the reason for the masks they can't pop a couple of xofluza or tamiflu it can be deadly for those people
 hcq must be given earlynsame as tamiflu nit help to slow down the ccp virusnand gives your immune system time to mount a defensen many doctors are taking it  prophylactically they just don't tweet or announce it publicly    ntrump derangement hidden agendas fear is deadly 
 flu vs covid death rate by agen nthis is also because we have no immunity effective vaccines or medicines like tamiflu for this brand new novel coronavirus pass this info on to covidiots who try to compare covid to the flu covid is much much deadlier wearadamnmask 
 hn testing stopped because a) there was a readily available therapy u tamiflu and other similar antivirals which also work on seasonal flu; b) hn is much less deadly  times less deadly than covid
 so i assume you mean flu prior to vaccines and tamiflu? last time we achieved herd immunity for a deadly disease without those tools we lost millions of lives  mill in 
 it wasn't as deadly i had it and took tamiflu and spent a week at home
 interesting how they misinform here  tamiflu was allowed to treat hnthree years before the double blind study versus hn was completedn fauci is trashnnfact check  swine flu spread rapidly but covid is more deadly  via 
 i never forget back in  i remember when i was sick i don't know what i got i remember my husband contact my doctor thankfully for the tamiflu medicine saved my lifennfact check  swine flu spread rapidly but covid is more deadly nn
  important differences between hn and covid are the mortality rate  covid is   times as deadly and that there were readily available treatments for hn  tamiflu amp; other antivirals n
 tamiflu can be a deadly treatment and also causes hallucinations
 why with tamiflu at all? it can be deadly
 yes tamiflu helps with flu if given very early on too bad covid is much more deadly and has no such cure (not sure about hydroxychlorquine) i guess since there is not tamiflu for covid it must be trump's fault
 hi tamiflu in regard to your book cover below does this include students when a gunman is walking through a classroom full of their dead classmates?

 half the country has not had covid the flu has treatments like tamiflu and other medicine stop or reduce it's effects on your body plus we have an inoculation to the flu which make it less deadly the difference is that more people get the flu than coronaviruses
 yes  deadly mercury amp; formaldehydeni was always ill after jobmandated flu shots in the 's amp; 's amp;  stopped them until   then i  contracted a horrible cause of flu was prescribed tamiflu nthe oncologist confirmed the sideeffects led to several of us getting cancer

 swine flu declared pandemic by whon millions wasted on ineffective tamiflu n narcolepsy cases from pandemicn millions of vaccines dumped n who scientists linked to big pharma  journalism is dead if i have to remind people of this and not you
 why did they test for hn flu susan?  so they would now when it arrived in a certain area hn was much less deadly and antivirals like tamiflu treated it covid is much more deadly they test to isolate people and contact trace treatments are hit and miss
 that's because we had a lifesaving drug called tamiflu for swain flu amp; spread was not that high nnrvalue for swain flu was  while for corona it's around  swain flu is more deadly than corona if not treated soon
 if it's a dangerous strain then yes like swine flu in 0 where we invested in huge stockpiles of tamiflu and isolated people with symptoms even barring them from gp surgeries and closing some schools all for a virus x less deadly than coronavirusnn
 dear racist bleephole ) the swine flu was more infectious but far less deadly than covid ) therapeutics like tamiflu were effective for hn ) we were able to develop and field a vaccine within  months of the first hn case stop spreading nonsense
 we have a flu vaccine a  annual vax rate and treatments like tamiflu and tens of thousands still diennwhat the everloving fuck do you think will happen when we have none of those mitigation measures and a far more deadly and contagious virus?
 you told me to pickup tamiflu from a local pharmacy i left your office and sat outside on a curb waiting for my husband to pick me up i was dying that's what you told me i would be dead in two weeks i cried at the pharmacist asking if i was going to be okay
 we also have a vaccine for the flu and tamiflu the flu is also quite a bit less contagious and less deadlynnlast year the flu killed k people in the us the whole year nnwith covid we are coming up on k in  months with many states grossly under reporting their numbers
 the shot isnut always affective due to mutations of the virus he probably did a rapid flu test to see which strand you had and gave antivirals tamiflu most likely i do recommend the flu shot because it is some protection and the flu is deadly this virus will be no different
 the flu has a vaccine and reliable treatments such as tamiflu and if we had a more than  vax rate we wouldn't lose 000 peopleyear to it nncovid is more deadly more contagious and we have no vaccine or good treatments yet

  tell that to these young people they lost both their parents and a grandmother the parents look like they're in their 's  i had the flu  or  years ago took some tamiflu and got better fast we don't have antiviral drugs for covid and it's deadlier

 not everyone can tolerate flu vaccines or tamifluflu does effect the lungs and heart of people with other conditionsthe same as covid either one is not deadly to all that get them
 that's not how vaccines work vaccines get your immune system prepared to combat a virus so that you don't have a deadly infection from it it's useless once you have been infected  it's why you don't get a flu shot when you get the flu you get tamiflu
 there has been a vaccine for the flu since forever 000 died in  considering there is a vaccine tamiflu amp; mitigations in place to prevent deaths those don't exist yet for coronavirus k are dead as of today by jan will probably be k

 they quit testing and had to ration tamiflu imagine this occurring right now over  million people got hn and it was far more deadly to children than covid we didnut shut a damn thing down
 will unfortunately be same as now immunity doesnut mean u cant spread it; just like flu except covid more ucdeadlyud than flu until a tamiflulike drug is readily available
 logical reasoning isnut allowed ucitus like the fluudexcept there isnut a vaccine there are no widely available therapeutics (ie tamiflu xofluza) itus more deadly and itus more contagious

 the problem with covid is it can trigger an ard which can be deadly  even if the vaccine is  effective it could hugely reduce the numbers developing ards and keep them alive  similar to using tamiflu against swine flu helped prevent severe symptoms not all symptoms

 too many demanding people wait until they couldn't breathe to get treatment was literally a deadly decision it should have been the opposite like we do with the flu and encourage folks to get treated within the first hrs tamiflu is only beneficial if taken right away

 i understand tamiflu sales are dead what happened to the flu this year? is it being reported as covid? govt pays more for vovid
 motivation matters and 'cancer' comparison doesn't really work because there are many types of cancer and common cold nobody's been motivated to knock out bc it's not deadly just annoying as for flu tamiflu works wonders if you'll fork over  and i have happily
 tamiflu is deadly
 total mortality doesn't lie and it's spiked badly during this pandemic nnas for why no tamiflu has been sold  it's because lockdowns work pretty well if it's enough to slow covid(which spreads much faster and has no immunities built up) it's enough to stop the flu dead
 covid is so deadly that it killed the seasonal flu havenut heard of anyone having it this year and prescriptions and sales for tamiflu are down to nearly nothing strange donut ya think
 people donut seem to get how quick and deadly this virus is vs influenza at least with influenza or hn we could send you home with tamiflu to try to make you feel better sooner or prevent that hospitalization
 we have tamiflu amp; a flu vaccine to treat influenza  flu can be deadly but it is not pushing hospitals to the brink amp; cases aren't skyrocketing  in my entire life i have not known anyone personally die of the flu  in the past  months i have known  people die of covid
