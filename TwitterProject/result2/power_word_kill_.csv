 honestly i find it hard to have sympathy for this mom it's not like she couldn't afford the tamiflu she clearly had access to it but she ignored doctor's orders and killed an innocent child because an article on some mommy blog told her western medicine kills nnwhy even
 if you get a disease you have been vaccinated for it can still kill you when you get flu and your doc prescribes tamiflu you don't say no thanks i'm just going to put potatoes in my socks
 yeah i'm willing to entertain the notion that results will vary on tamiflu based on a number of mitigating factors but my point here is that people are taking medical advice from people who couldn't pass a basic biology  class and it's literally killing their children

 because the flu doesnut transmit as easily have such a long incubation period in which people may be unaware they have it and are infecting others or kill as large a percentage of those infected as this new virus does all while having no vaccine or treatment such as tamiflu
 could something like the ciprocheney phenomenon prior to the  anthrax attacks be taking place?nantibiotics don't kill viruses so there would have to be a vaccine already developed for covid according to uchicago medicine tamiflu can prevent influenzaubut not covid
 hey dumbassesnnwe know the flu kills peoplennthat's why flu vaccines (prevention) and drugs like tamiflu (treatment) are among the most important medical breakthroughs in the last  yearsnnlisten to doctors listen to nurses listen to scientists covid 
 tamiflu is killing people do not take it look it up i took my son to the er and the doctor told me that he was going to prescribe it but he wouldn't give it to his kids i said if you wouldn't give it to your kids then im not giving it to mine my daughter is a emt she said no
 anything in the world that kills people there are steps put in place to try and stop those deaths such as a flu shot or tamiflu for instance but so far there is no vaccine or treatment for this virus so staying home and shutting things down is the only way we have to try
 nothing of that sort happened it was media scare which created social distancing tamiflu was sold in black market to benefit few ppl and it continues to kill ppl even today 
 instead of self production of tamiflu the then govt imported stuff from outside a less infectious virus killed  ppl with no concept of social distancing what the hell you talking about rahul's fanboy??
 comparing swineflu with covid tells how well you understand it sir one that can be cured by tamiflu tablets amp; the other that's killing people of wwiinnit's unprecedented hope you know the wordnsocial_distancing amp; lockdown is all we have to handle it so far 
 people just aren't as afraid of flu bc they blindly trust  flu shot (only worked  of the time) and they believe tamiflu is a medicine to treat it if anything they should be terrified that there is a vaccine and medicine and it still kills that many false sense of security
   we have a seasonal flu vaccine n  we have tamiflun  we are prepared for it every yearn  flu kills u0a vs cv kills u0an  this is an unknown entity that we were in no way prepared for and the government basically invited it in due to lack of preparedness
 if you can just get tamiflu and go home why does it kill 000 to 000 americans every year?

 corona hasnut killed  million today worldwide corona has killed and affected  cdc numbers of flu  deaths of  and has affected millions all of this after vaccination and having a treatment option like tamiflu
 before vaccinations and treatments like tamiflu flu killed over  million worldwidekilled  in the us alone so saying the virulence and pathogenicity of flu is less than corona doesnut add up

 once the vaccineantibiotic is found back to normal lahnnhn infected almost mil people and killed almost  all over the world now that we got tamiflu hn is just another virus
  it was a new strain of virus so research did have to be done to plan treatment  n flu kills many people every year i mean we could look up how many since trump took office (itus irrelevant) n tamiflu shortage n vaccine had to be developed n flu is a common illness
 my point this new thing you canut get a shot for they donut have a tamiflu  make it shorter this is going get worse amp;will affect all ages globally about  of reported covid cases have died by comparison seasonal flu generally kills far fewer than  of those infected
 its doubtful drugs that actually kill the virus like antibiotics kill bacteria are possible their intracellular nature makes it difficult most therapies focus on not letting the virus enter replicate in or exit the cell many times it has to be used early to work (tamiflu)
 sir the only way to kill corona is to give blanket treatment to all positive cases with hcqazithral tamiflu whether they are sick or no

 hi there's a treatment for the flu it's called tamiflu and there's a vaccine that can prevent the flu or lessen the severity of the flu so yeah we know how to deal with the flu covid is new it's still getting figured out and it kills x more ppl than the flu
 the regular flu has killed tens of thousands already this year alone but all you get is uc go get some tamiflu from cvsud

 they gave him tamiflu that's most likely what killed him covid in it's worse case scenario is a really severe case of pneumonia the majority of the elderly die of pneumonia 
 they gave him tamiflu???? that's your killer right there
 something i think a lot of people do not quite understand the problem with the corona virus is the lack of treatment there is a reason the flu does not kill millions a year get some tamiflu and take two days offnnvaccine will come long after the treatment
 yes regular flu kills a lot of people that's with good vaccines amp; prescription drugs like tamiflu nothing like that exists for covid for the sake of this nation you need to provide more testing protective gear respirators hospital space coronaviruspandemic 
 i had the flu in december i think no testing just felt like i was on deaths door with  fever for  days cough lasted a month w tamiflu antibiotics and supportive meds nif a  yr old with emphysema got that it would kill them nnproblem is this spreads without symptoms
 so despite our vaccine for the flu and xofluza and tamiflu we have at a minimum 000 deaths so far this year in the usa  lets ignore that and focus on a virus that has killed 000 worldwide
 you and your ilk have helped to kill children worldwide and now in the midst of a pandemic youure spreading more misinformation you are absolutely vile and worthless delete your account
 the flu has a vaccine it has medical treatments like tamiflu and other things yes it can kill people but the coronavirus is more contagious more lethal (per people like anthony fauci) and there is no curetreatment can we stop complaining about things being shut down?
 tamiflu kills
 stupid health care provider syop sudjested f tamiflu you killing people ass whoel
 ucthe fluud as your charmingly call it is a general term for viruses the corona virus is more virulent than ucthe fluud when you say ucthe fluud has killed more americans which strain are you comparing? now factor in seasonal flu vaccinations early treatment (tamiflu) 
 there's more than a few people running the 'flu kills more people hiv kills more people' line he's a quick reply covid has only been around for three months we have no community immunity we also have no vaccine no tamiflu cure no retroviral drugs its a shit argument
 you don't get it flu  something we spread easily carry often affects a huge swath of our society we have a vaccine amp; some recovery measures for (tamiflu) kills way more a virus that barely has touched our society amp; we have nothing to prevent or treat with has moved in

 i am totally shocked  was it the tamiflu or the swine flu that nearly killed my daughter?
 and tamiflu flu would kill a lot less if everyone who can would get vaccinated
 ium t diabetic last christmas i spent  days in hospital with influenza a and pneumonia iuve had  years of flu vaccines and ended up on tamiflu  antibiotics amp; painkillers now imagine that with no vaccine and no drugs stop playing games with lives  highriskcovid
 gilead also holds patents on a ton of antivirals for hiv many of which are  for a daily dose out of pocket and they made a killing on the patent for tamiflu during iraq in other words they fuckin suck 
 they all get the flu shot to help minimize their risk also  they can get tamiflu antiviral to help minimize sickness not so with the covid that is a potential kill rate x or higher the flu
 at the pharmacy and just heard the cashier tell a customer at the drivethru that their tamiflu would be  and antibiotic would be  the customer could only afford the antibiotic cashier gave her a dropper so that tamiflu was for for a kid nnrx prices are killing us
 yes now use whatever critical thinking skills you have ready? 000 people get the flu dailywith a vaccine available along with tamiflu etc000000 perish with a vaccine available ish dead from cv in  days you get it?
 do you remember the coverage of the hn pandemic in  which killed 000 americans mostly under age ? i donut recall such hysteria and panic tamiflu was said to help with it but there was none available feds failed badly on getting it to patients
 another tamiflu death damn that drug kills too often
 my son and his girlfriend live and work in nyc they both have fevers and coughs their docs on phone calls prescribed tamiflu both have had flu shots testing not available as parents itus the not knowing that kills you wash your hands
  of people infected need critical intervention and for the  that donut itus still a very rough ride nnwe can also treat the flu with antivirals like tamiflu covid has no clinical treatmentnneducate yourself and donut spread shit posts you can actually kill someone
 ignorance at its finest this isn't even an actual pandemic this is fear mongering the flu kills more people the flu vaccine and tamiflu do as well yet deaths are still improperly recorded as flu you go ahead and line up then for the first coronavirus vaccine
 are you hearing well the flu kills 's of 's per year so therennexactlynnthat's withnnavailable testingna vaccinentamiflunshorter incubationnfewer covert carriers (asymptomatic)nlower mortalitynndon't believe people who say coronavirus isn't exponentially worse
 and the average virus doesnut kill you you know that tamiflu is an antiretroviral that treats the flu right? most virusu donut kill you a common cold doesnut need antiviral treatment
 i had the flumonday night i thought i was gonna die the painnausea and dizziness was so bad i had to call  to get me to the hospitalthey put a swab up my nose to see if i had iti did not the coro kindon tamiflu which will kill it have to take it every  hours a mask to
 i had hn the reason why people werenut going crazy is because tamiflu was receptive and helped people recover this on the other hand does not have a medication to slow it down and it still killed 000 imagine how many people will die if this spreads
 tamiflu isnut a cure itus helps decrease the length symptoms by approximately  day also the flu kills less than  of people annually iud say the vaccine and treatment do a pretty damn good job of decreasing mortality
 for anyone interested (no one is) tamiflu targets and blocks an enzyme that allows viruses to leave their infected cells  slowing the spread of viruses it does not kill virions it is not a cure
 we had a cure for swine flu if you caught it fast enough tamiflu would kill it i got infected with hn from my dad and on day  of symptoms doc gave me tamiflu and gone immediately
 this corona virus is really killing my mood ik you canut cure a virus and can only treat symptoms like a flu but like dang make something like tamiflu
 this is the kind of thing most people never think about but it matters nownnalso despite what most say tamiflu is a part of treating this thing itus an antiviral and it slows down covidus replication rate in the body it slows spread down just doesnut kill it
 my then yr old got hn in  it kicked his ass for about  days doc gave him tamiflu and that helped scary couple of days though as that one killed mostly kids and young adults
 itus probably already been said but we have tamiflu and the deadly bacterial infections that kill you when you started with influenza are also treatable with antibiotics none of that is true for sarscov my  year old got hn during that summer her camp closed
 experimental drugs like tamiflu was for flu that shit is killing people  canut trust the cdc recommendation but iud trust dr larry palevsky or these are the doctors you should be having on the stock market shows why donut you guys listen
 there is a vaccine for the flu and i get the vaccine every year there is also tamiflu to treat it  there is also a vaccine for pneumonia the complication and i've gotten that there is no vaccine or treatment for covid the severe inflammation in my lungs would kill me
 seems to be an overkill the koreans suggest either kaletra (the hiv coctail) or chloroquinenot both plus tamiflu doesn't work for sars covcov they haven't read the papers ? why r these rajasthan doctors carpet bombing the italian ? udeudd
 thwy need to go home with tamiflu unless they r elderly or immunocompromised just like if they had the flu this is being way over done did u know it is killed just with regular laundry detergent not even that virulent we are being played and it is super sad
 well you know they did take tamiflu which kills people no couldn't be that though smh
 tamiflu is absolutely killing ppl  wakeupamerica
 unfortunately itus very hard to make antivirals that actually kill a virus even tamiflu used for the flu is not technically a uccureud so pretty unlikely we will have a cure or a vaccine anytime soon if at all
 also wash ur damn hands nnhand sanitizer is antibacterial and wonut kill the virus itus why we use amoxicillin for strep and not oseltamivir (tamiflu) amp; vice versa nnso wash ur hands and be weary of what you touch and put close to your mouth
 this isnut even comparable to the flu the flu kills  this currently is nthe flu is well known has the flu shot and tamiflunthis is still unknown udeuddudcudffcuduufe0f
 someone was just like the flu kills more people every year than coronavirus has yeah and i get my flu shot and take tamiflu if i get the flu too there aren't vaccines or antivirals for this shit and we're in peak flu season too i don't want to die from any of them?
 i hadnut been out of the country or around anyone i knew to be sick they gave me tamiflu amp; amoxicillin amp; said take tylenol and motrin to get fever down  days later still swollen tonsils amp; sinus drainage cont coldsinus meds amp; extra pain killers for  more days udeuddudcudffcuduufe0f ()
 iuve had flu twice as an adult st fever topped at  i begged people to kill me lol sick  wks nd got tamiflu fever  felt like bad cold sick wks if corona is worse iud be hosed
 also it lets those who have just the flu have piece of mind and they know what treatment to do otherwise say spouse has flu like symptoms you take tamiflu for  days as precaution go back to work tamiflu didn't kill covid it just didn't show up yet now you are spreading
 except this highly contagious even more so than the known influenza there is no vaccine and no uctamifluud   no one is trying to compete with the flu trying to get a handle on it before it does kill more people
 your research skills have slipped so bad that youud never pass the bar exam na national health emergency was passed in april 0 before anyone died in the us it included releasing a quarter of the national stockpile of tamiflu which saved lives
 were they trying to kill him? i don't get it? prayers for this man and his familynnwith the well known serious side effecs of tamiflu and taking antibiotics for viral infections can do more harm than good cdc i would be questioning this onenn 
 i'm responding to tamiflu so it's a good bet main concern with thread was ) people carelessly transmitting with bad hygiene not a good omen for covid ) unskilled primary care couldn't provide differential diagnosis and actually gave rx which could harm viral pt )  (next twt)
 tamiflu is an antiviral drug it 'kills' those viruses that are not resistant against it ie it goes against the virus not the symptoms of an influenza there's a number of other antivirals that have effect on strains of those viruses
 omg reminds me of the woman on the train who flat out told me ucthe flu is worse and kills more peopleud what? but we have flu vaccines  some degree of immunity against it and tamiflu to treat it this is not that
 i have read that it's a viral bilateral pneumonia that's killing most folks with covid does that mean our antiviral pneumonia meds are not working on it? tamiflu relenza rapivab?
 probably a  influenza type virus spliced with killer strandnntamiflu       days treatment helps recovery nncohort of        recovered without hospitalization  all now ok
 coronavirus      probably a influenza virus with a killer spice        tamiflu    days    helps recovery
 why does the coronavirus spread so easily between people?   probably a influenza virus spliced with a killer strand  tamiflu   for  days helps recovery
 how about this telling the truth about risk heus been saying risk is overblown itus not hn killed so many not bc of tamiflu shortage but bc of vaccine shortage covid has no vaccine so limiting contact is crucial but heus telling us to go about business as usual
 thereus a lot of misinformation out there thereus also probably a lot of with held information you should be able to see on cdc website that flu a and b kill way more percentage wise and thatus considering we have a flu vaccine and tamiflu donut panic
 imean if this had a tamiflu a vaccine would it be killing  or ? likely not just the very old and lung compromised
 if the flu is bad enough to kill people and there are antibiotics and things like tamiflu i can't imagine getting corona virus my  year old has the flu it is very nasty th time with it since nov this is the worse yet
 itus is spreading like wild fire we have tamiflu for the regular flu and vaccines this is going to kill us all we need test kits to stop this you promised one million where are they?? trumpdemic
 lol tamiflu doesnut come anywhere close to uckillingud the flu
 tamiflu does not uckillud influenza data that states it works is based on low quality observational studies it has not been shown to reduce influenza mortality rates
 oh yeah what tamiflu is some shit i donut know what was worse that or the actual flu i still stayed sick three more weeks after i took it didnut kill a damn thing didnut think it did anyways
 influenza can still kill you don't be too relieved agree with tamiflu suggestions
 we do have drugs to kill viruses they are antiviral meds like tamiflu but need to be made for specific viruses should have covid antivirals ready in  days
 reminds me about the time when the us was stockpiling tamiflu donald rumsfeld was also making a killing (pardon the pun) 
 if you can test it how the hell dont you have something to ease the symptoms like a tamiflu to control pandemic you're killing americans causing panic yet campaigning udeuddcudeuddcudeuddcudeuddc
 tamiflu is hardly a treatment as it canut be used after hrs onset of symptoms it may or may not shorten the duration of a  flu by  hrs you do not recover quickly from the flu and flu kills elderly and immunocompromised stop fear mongering
 same here  it came in suddenly  i was sick for over a week even with tamiflu   stayed in bed for  days  i never ever get sick  last time i was sick like this was when hn went through killing two in my communityone less than four blocks from me
 gatoraid copper pennies help kill the virus on hands and other surfaces zinc lozenges might mitigate the amount that gets into your lungs theraflu or tamiflu and tylenol might help with fever and mucinex might help suppress mucus formation
 hysteria? people nervous about something thatus going around that you canut see but can kill you silly them but ium sure your concern is more about how itus affecting the market not whous dying the antiviral tamiflu does not cure the flu it is to try and shorten the illness
 righhhhhtuddude0 like bro if you wanna look at statistics the flu kills people every year and even then people refuse to vaccinate or take precautions some people even refuse tamiflu when they come back positive like yuall are really worried about the wrong virusudduded i canut
 just because you can find a marker to identify doesn't mean it can kill the virus tamiflu doesn't cure the flu it just helps reduce the rate of viral reproduction so your immune system can take over and start to win
 seems weuve turned this into a sick competitionnnflu iuve infected and killed way more than you even with annual vaccines and tamiflu i canut be stoppedncovid who says my kill rate is ; ium just getting started and thereus no treatment gimme a year
 my youngest child is one of those kids that a poke during dental work could kill him so he has to take an antibiotic beforehand  i am broke as hell and just stayed home  days because of a positive flu test and kiddo had to take tamiflu stay home 
 tamiflu kills  iud like a study of the deaths ufrom the fluu to see if tamiflu was given  i donut not trust you the doctor we are ultimately on the same team i do not trust big pharm
 gilead is set to make a killing on a coronavirus vaccine same company guilty of exorbitant monopoly pricing on their hep c miracle cure (domestically) gilead also developed tamiflu which states stockpiled in fear of a bird flu epidemicn 
 how many who died ucfrom the fluud took tamiflu? tamiflu killed them but big pharma wonut say this they push this harmful rx globally uddudc
 the flu kills thousands of people every year tamiflu barely touches the sides and yes the vaccine is super important but doesnut cover all strains
 most people who die from the flu were either immune compromised or tamiflu killed them
 sad numbers  people killed by the flu amp; united healthcare had the audacity to deny my tamiflu prescription stating itus a plan exclusion even though i have a choice plus plan i got the flu vaccination and still contracted the flu
 me too my family understands but so many don't seem to comparing it to the flu we can take precautions for the flu like the flu shot amp; tamiflu if we get it there's nothing we can do about this except hope and pray we dont get it and if we do it doesn't kill us
 normally treatment means medication that either suppresses or kills the virus not a vaccine that would prevent infection think tamiflu for influenza unfortunately tamiflu's effectiveness is questionable at best however pence isn't a scientistdoctor so who knows
 coronavirus what a great job tv is doing to scare people to death i remember swine flu i was misdiagnosed over the phone by the  service they gave me tamiflu and it almost killed me so if some sneezes is that self isolation udeuddudeudd coronaoutbreak gmb
 except itus not at all perspective flu is slowed by flu shots and still spreads flu has basically a cure in tamiflu and still kills this spreads the exact same way puts ten times the amount in the hospital and kills multiples more thereus no shot and no treatment
 lots of liquor and amphetamines should cure whatever ails you just like hunter s thompson oh wait that shot killed him ok try tamiflu and vitamin c
 why does anyone go to er or doctor for a virus? you can't kill viruses they just go dormant gotta ride it out all they'll give you is symptom relief that you can get otc tamiflu caused geart palpitations in my mom said never take
 are you fkn nuts? tamiflu is trash and everybody knows it including the manufacturer quit killing people via twitter 
 i had it tooafter tamiflu rx not to severebut it took months for vaccine and 000 deaths to get his attention   regular flu kills moreevery year but criticizing trump makes haters feel gooduddude 
 test for what? a novel virus? antibiotics don't work tamiflu might help at top it's flu most healthy people are fine flu kills elderly immune compromised infants every winter so far we're having light winternfakenews hypenyou seem to like to be gaslit every day fake
 i bet you that nyquil and tamiflu combined will kill the corona virus uddudc
 we know flu flu has vaccinecovid doesnut flu has trt tamiflucovid doesnutpeople know the symptoms of flupeople trap coughs etc amp; wash hands with flu upshot is covid will infect far more people than flu so even with lower mortality rate will ultimately kill more people
 corona has a much longer incubation period and kills  times more of those infected tamiflu helps with the flu as does an annual vaccine in varyingdegrees the influenza viruses prefer to live in the upper respiratory area while corona seems to want to replicate in the lung
 welll that is true but covid is diff from the flu in a few ways we have a vac for the flu and treatment (anti viral tamiflu) we don't have a treatment for covid also generally the flu kills the immunocompromised only covid is killing non immunocompromised
 this flu is killing me (  tamiflu get it together and stop these headaches and body aches
 so with remdesivir we are killing a fly with a bazooka i remember when tamiflu prices skyrocket because hn panic now viruses got resistent and tamiflu once effective against real diseases is  uselessncovid lockdownend remdesvir remdesevir
 the flu shot helps to mitigate the flu symptoms also you can take tamiflu to help end the flu in three () days the coronavirus is much more contagious and lethal eg flu killed k americans in past  weeks the coronavirus killed k in  weeks and more unknowns exist
 tamiflu also kills people one of the listed side effects is literally death
 dr fauci nazt was a flop amp; hiv killed slowly ntamiflu shortens illness from  to  days but no decrease in death rate nnot good that the reviews of this high powered study showed faster recovery (big whoop) but not death rate which is all that really counts for quarantines
 i see it like tamiflu i know the flu could very well kill me or send me into dire straits so the relative risk to people like us isn't that different tamiflu is a safety net a therapeutic for novel coronavirus would have to be seen as a similar tool
 how is it invalid?  it has a higher rate of infection  it is  currently killing people  it is leaving recovered people with organ and neurological damagenow  real world nextrapolate backward  look at avg influenza data before vaccines and tamiflu for your comparisons
 he wouldnut be one of the people who spent u00am of tax payers money stockpiling tamiflu after claims there would be around k deaths in the uk from hn would he? hn between  amp;  would kill just  people amp; tamiflu was less effective than paracetamol treating it
 well we never made vaccines for either and for hiv they tried for  yrsuddudecnhcvhiv antivirals work because they are pretty slow viruses that take a decade to killneven if we come up anti viral for covid it will be (at best) as effective as tamiflu
 we have a vaccine for the flu pharmaceuticals like tamiflu for the flu and the flu doesnut kill this many americans in a month the seasonal flu is nothing compared to this
 then why did you shout covid related pneumonia is killing people?nninfluenza treatments can't be used on covid or it's related problems so i just get why you linked an influenza study at allnnif it did rx tamiflu (flu med) would have already been widely usedtried
 much time in the sun you get the idea ium sure trump didnut mean we should inject patients with  alcohol what he meant was why canut scientists just invent an agent that kills the virus we already have some of those think of tamiflu (influenza) and arvs (hiv) these
 but itus worth pointing out that itus not that remdesivir is ineffective against sarscov it probably is effective itus more that killing the virus isnut the main problem later on in disease progression tamiflu has a similar issue
 i had tamiflu in december i had one and i reacted badly and looked at the package insert and refused more just one tablet almost killed me off
 covid kills ten times the seasonal flu in a bestcase scenario bozo and there is a flu vaccine and some medicines that work to some extent such as tamiflu and sambucol with covid we have no vaccine and no drugs moron
 influenza still kills people ium not a moron but it kills way less than it would if we had no flu shot and no known treatment for people who got it u looking at you tamiflu
 thisudufe0f and we have medical advances but we still donut have a way to uckillud or reduce the viral load like we do bacterial infections  we have tamiflu which helps lessen the severity of influzena especially in immune compromised people we donut have that (yet) for this
 what about families of just as many that have been lost to the flu it has a vaccine and tamiflu and still kills s every year
 went into overdrive and killed a couple of people combining kaletrahcq and tamiflu but later they curbed their overenthusiasm
 ok you make my point by trying to make yours a bad flu season can kill k that's with a flu vaccine  tamiflu  herd immunity wo it in  flu killed m globally c has no vaccine treatment or herd immunity with social distancing it's already killed 000 in a month
 udeudduduufe0f 000 deaths over a year for an illness already accounted for in healthcare systems around the world this virus has killed  in about  weeks in the uk totally overwhelming our hospitals not only that we don't even have treatments like tamiflu use your brain
 this was targeted for seniors  and those with high risk diseases  last hn from china flu killed college students and young children till we got tamiflu then you had to payb00 for it so do you see my point here  i sense fraud and intentional harm
 note the red line no vaccine amp; no cure for covid          tamiflu amp; vaccine for flu donut peddle ridiculous information it gets people killed 
 eff opening back outside when the heck are we going to get vaccinations;spray that kill the virus from being airborne;a pill like tamiflu or a zpack and season of when it peak? those are the real questionpharmaceutical where yall at?we kno yall like capitalizing off everything
 the flu shot and tamiflu probably kill just as many people as the flu
 we have treatments and medication for the flu tamiflu was developed when swine flu came onto the scene heads up swine flu still kills people to this day
 the typical flu kills tens of thousands of unvaccinated people a year the difference is that a vaccine and proven treatments exist tamiflu etc ncovid does not have a vaccine or treatment it is highly contagious and has a high mortality rate
 i donut think anyone is saying the virus will be eradicated like the flu old and unhealthy will be advised to vaccinate because the virus may kill them younger healthier may take their chances as they do with flu and expect to endure it as w tamiflu
 itus going as fast as possible you canut skip a step or speed up like baking a cake it doesnut cook faster if you turn the oven up to nwe also need antivirals a treatment for the sick like tamiflu for seasonal flu forget the stuff trump is pushing itus killing people
 the flu kill more people last year than the rona reopen the america  moronnncorvid has no treatment or vaccinenninfluenza has treatments such as tamiflu and a yearly vaccine  nnpeople used your fucking brain and think
 worldwide the flu kills over 000 people  even though we have vaccines treatments like tamiflu and even some degree of herd immunity  you really believe c is worse with only 000 deaths?   social distancing isnut that good   openamericanow
 again i point out the  flu killed over 000 people it sickened m with m going to the doctor  000 had to be hospitalized  all of this even though we had a vaccine and tamiflu  and yet few people even noticed we are overreacting to a virus with  mild cases
 the biggest difference is there is no current treatment there is tamiflu for the flu there is a vaccine and this bug attaches to your lung cells to reproduce and yes the flu kills a lot of people but if there was no vaccine it would kill a helluva a lot more like in 
 it felt like the flu (hn) was going to kill me this yearnntamiflu helped but took one month before i was wellnni take the flu shot every yearnngood luck
 we have a flu vaccine tamiflu and most years the flu isn't particularly lethal though it still kills thousands thing is it does so spread out over months
 flu has never killed k new yorkers in half a month  people have protection from having it before as well as flu shots and tamiflu can reduce the severity but that assumes you can get a test to confirm thatus what you have 
 exactly flu will have a similar mortality with and vaccine and tamiflu  this one hits older people hard cause no preexisting immunity  but flu is much harder on younger healthy people  the common cvs kill people each year and the older people must have had these before
 smart emailer also notes flu has never killed k new yorkers in half a month  people have protection from having it before as well as flu shots and tamiflu can reduce the severity but that assumes you can get a test to confirm thatus what you have
 there is a flu vaccine and tamiflu to treat the flu if there was no social distancing covid would have killed a lot more people less people dying implies social distancing is working not that influenza is more lethal donut politicize topics you are uninformed about
 here we go with the flu kills thousands bsnwe have studied the flu for decades we have a vaccine for it and tamiflunhumans don't have an immunity to covid its incubation period is  days longer than the flu and its  times deadlier than flundo you enjoy being stupid?
 did i say it did? the argument is the flu amp; covid are not comparable which they aren't wbasic stats one has a vaccine amp; proven treatments (tamiflu) while the other doesn't one kills at 000 of world population  the yr while other has been hovering between  
 you do realize there's no vaccine right? there's no herd immunity there's no  successful treatment like tamiflu this is new this can kill a healthy person in no time no new cases would be great but we need to do what we can do as citizens to protect people
 maybe if the flu was gonna kill me i'd take tamiflu but not normally i gotta believe what the doctor says
  we donut have a vaccine and we donut even understand the immunity list infection yet vaccine is a long way away n there is no uctamifluud for this yetnthe regular flu kills that many with those  things on our side the only tool we have right now is isolation
 swine flu killed between 000 and 000 i struggle to remember the response but remember tamiflu before it went away aids has killed approx  million and kills around 000 a year donut get bogged down by the numbers
 covidufc blimey april   the antiviral drug tamiflu was stockpiled from  in the uk when some agencies were predicting that a pandemic of bird flu could kill up to 000 people in britain similar decisions were made in other countries 
 as he points out there was the same over hyped reaction with swine flu the usual suspects big pharma made a killing (tamiflu) and the nhs went into more debt 
 idiot hn had a vaccine (tamiflu) and killed less than 000 in  year though  million were infected in the usa covid has already killed  in  months and only infected  in the usa and thereus no vaccine in site fuck your conspiracy theory
 yep seasonal flu kills 000 each year and that's with a  vax rate and treatments including tamiflunnno vax  no treatments  three times as contagious  we're screwed without containment strategies
 the hn flu killed less people over  months than this beast had killed in  weeks we also had tamiflu to help treat people who were sick obama declared a national emergency within weeks not months this is a novel virus and the danger is exponentially higher
 totally amazed that she will not look at facts yes the flu kills however we have a vaccine for it and we also have tamiflu we have nothing for this go ahead and meet up with the college kids and hang out with them
 aren't we really just buying time for a vaccine or a tamiflu  without these  it's going to kill whoever it's chooses too just over a longer period  ventilators aren't saving many lives  if  years from now there is no vaccine the death toll will still be astronomical
 i mean lots of diseases requiring antibiotics used to kill us we donut have vaccines for all of them right? and vaccines donut always work as in i had a flu shot got the flu cured with tamiflu
 the idea that a respiratory virus could be cured with a silver bullet in the form of a well known widely used drug was insanity at best something can reduce the symptoms the only proven antiflu drugu tamiflu u hasnut stopped flu from killing lots of people
 tamiflu almost killed my daughter  it works in most patients uchelpsud with the flu but can be very toxic to many as well  just like hydroxy yet americans will take tamiflu with no problem read the box the side affects are real and normal
 this is a tough virus and kills some people which is tragic agree w u this drug combo (hydroxy  zpack  zinc) is going to be just like tamiflu is for the flu ask any md what drugs they would take if they had the virus hands down this combo period
 actually as of rn itus at a  survival rate while the flu has killed more people we have tamiflu and other meds with a vaccine for it with corona we need to stay inside because we have nothing
 my head is exploding over how effectively trump is playing all his hcq critics no itus not a panacea yes it quite possibly works at least as well as tamiflu in inflnz a he will trot out anecdotal survivors giving tearful thanks amp; he will accuse critics of killing s
 the speed at which certain vaccines are pumped out is a concern there was a news story about japanese ppl (mostly teenagers) who killed themselves when they took tamiflu (ie oseltamivir) how some of these poor kids died though was borderline horrific 
 finland verkar vara ett fungerande land till skillnad fru00en coronasverige det enda den regimen gjorde under svininfluensan var att skapa ett lager med tamiflu mediciner och lyxsaker  endast fu00fr grisar i maktstu00ellningn
 true advanced pneumonia is what is killing people with other co morbidites hc alone will not help it works very similar to tamiflu in that ina window it is effective at reducing the strength of the virus and complications that go with it
 hydroxychloroquine can also trigger undetected rapid heart failure especially in men it can also destroy the kidneys and liver leading to death  the csiro tamiflu antiviral is also effective in killing the virus as well  another problem is drowning from liquid in the lungs
 yep i had combined virus (influenza a) and suspected bacterial infection tamiflu for virus and augmentin for bacteria headache was incredible  for  days could only snatch an hour's sleep at at time after painkillers also sore throat and fever
 we have medicine such as tamiflu ibuprofen tylenol to help offsetdecrease the symptoms of the flu the flu has been around for over a hundred years when it first came into existence when there was no cure for the flu it killed over a million people
 related complications in other words reckless medical treatments (probably some combination of tamiflu hydrochloroquine and antibiotics) ultimately killed him
 the flue has a vaccine the flue kills  (covid is much higher) the flu  covid will collapse hospital systems the flu is actually less virulent nweuve studies flu strains for decades flu has low incubation we have tamiflu (treatment) this isnut like the flu itus worse
  million cases in the usa did have tamiflu for it killed up to half a million worldwide
 it's exceedingly more contagious there is no medicine no vaccine for it the flu has tamiflu amp; other meds amp; vaccines this kills you easier because it is a brand new virus that we don't know anything about yetwill it be seasonal? will it actually go away? who knows
 i got a flu vaccine this year pal and when i got flu back in  we got tamiflu i think there's more antivirals you can get too aye it kills a lot of people but we have defencesnnthis isn't a flu like illness it's not influenza it's a sars like illness
 we have a vaccine for the flu that reduces cases right off the top health care workers are generally vaccinated for it so it doesn't kill all who treat patients vaccine doesn't always prevent but often makes less severe we have fdaapproved drug tamiflu to treat flu
 i'm not saying that isn't true  i'm just saying currently we only have case studies to try and heal someone with the disease  if you get the flu you're going straight to tamiflu and it will kill it within hrs  we don't have anything like that yet besides quin
 and boy how many damn years are people going to let them stay in office and do nothing?? in addition tamiflu? the toxic drug that has killed more americans with the flu than it has saved glad you shared this oldie as it says much more to me and you too ndidnt kill fast enough

 what is possible in a much shorter time frame is an antiviral an agent that kills the virus such as tamiflu for swine flu a few weeks ago it looks like the antimalaria drug chloroquine would work but detailed trials show no statistically significant deviation from palliatives
 weure missing some important info here;n) there is an antiviral (tamiflu) for seasonal influenza none yet for covid forget hydroxyc thatus killing peoplen) mortality for covid is higher than seasonal influenzancovid appears more infectious than seasonal flu
 listen its not like tamiflu where is doesn't work for them it kills them try to keep up

 it was discovered early on that antivirals like tamiflu were effective in treating hn the death rate of each of the viruses is also incomparable i think the only thing you have made clear in your post is your weak math skills and your clueless ultracrepidarian view

 i know right? the big mistake the obama administration made was in overpreparing for the arrival of hn by buying millions of unnecessary doses of tamiflu at jackedup prices and oh yes donald rumsfeld made a killing off those sales
