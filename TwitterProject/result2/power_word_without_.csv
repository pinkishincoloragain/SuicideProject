 she won't prescribe any kind of stimulant medication like adderall concerta etc without some kind of full psychological workup so i've also been referred to that as well probably will go for it just to see what they say cause the wellbutrin is a bit of a long shot
 i don't know you should ask your doctor i've use cannabis with  zoloft prozac and wellbutrin without any issues but i'm not a doctor
 one of the comments here pointed out that wellbutrin is an adhd stimulant but i take it for depression because i have zero energy without it so uhhh hm i'm not addicted and my dr says wellbutrin isn't addictive so hmm?? maybe that's why i don't have adhd because of the meds
 also the pharmacy told me i was trying to refill my mg wellbutrin too early almost a week ago when i had  pills left; i guess it's lucky i had one left of the  but i may have to go tomorrow without anything let's see how that goes udeuddudcudffbuduufe0f
 alexa what's the largest dose of wellbutrin i can take without dying?
 yes this is the same psychiatrist who gave me an envelope of loose pills so that i could get wellbutrin immediately without having to go to cvs (which according to him is the most evil corporation in existence) and yes this is also kat von dus uncle what a dipshit
 hiuklonopin is a benzo amp; addictive many psychiatrist do not prescribe this pill without first trying a fairly long list of other medications if you havenut tried lexipro wellbutrin busprirone and other meds first i wouldnut recommend taking klonopin at all uufe0f
 ps my week on wellbutrin was without doubt the worst week of my life but so glad it works for you amp; that you got some pills because abrupt discontinuation always sucks
  brand name without insurance is k for a  day supply the generic was  happy independence day in the usnhah
 i have bipolar ii generalized anxiety disorder cptsd and suspected but not diagnosed adhd nni was on wellbutrin topamax and adderall and tried several other medications ultimately i now smoke weed go to therapy do art and try my best without meds

 i have depression and mild anxietynni take wellbutrin sertraline and trazodone (can't fall asleep without it if i don't take it i end up staying awake for  hours)nnsearch for a new therapist has been on pause since last year but hopefully i can find one 
 i have some kinda anxiety disorder and it rules my entire life which is why i see a therapist that my budget could do without every  weeks depending on her schedule i take prozac and have been on varying doses of that since ? and added wellbutrin in ish 
 this helpful s is brought to you by mg of zoloft mg of wellbutrin and mg of adderall a daynnthat soldier from before? without those meds? not so helpful or focused or happynnmeds don't change who you are they let you be who you are
 honestly wellbutrin has done a lot to regulate my anxiety and despair but now ium basically flat all the time and go very long stretches without crying which is abnormal for me
 last one was super focused on general anxiety without targeting the roots or other issues and ran me thru lexapro and wellbutrin and i didnt react well to either psych before that tried to give me abilify at  and naturally that just made me wanna kermit
 i donut think i updated anyone on the status of my meds but i miraculously got them filled in time so i will not be without but i am also experiencing migraines from going back on the wellbutrin so i probably wonut wanna burn my eyes out drawing til i adjust in a week or so(?)
 bupropion is a novel antidepressant but also sold as zyban for smoking cessation i kinda figured drug companies just like to create extra markets but really the whole time i was on wellbutrinus max dose i smoked zero cigarettes without even thinking about it
 don't forget your wellbutrin you're raw without it but mortality never goes away; self abnegation is ever out of reach
 i would really like to find something similar to the way wellbutrin made me feel for those few hours of the day but with far more stability and obviously without the side effects ssris donut seem to agree with me so ium looking more at atypical and other kinds
 yeah i take wellbutrin now actually it helps quite a bit even without adderall tbh i just think adderall might help with my brain fog lmao thank you tho i really appreciate it
 where would i be now without the mountain goats genuinely like i would be an only child who takes wellbutrin
 i used wellbutrin with some lozenges for backup needed the lozenges for maybe  weeks with the meds took wellbutrin maybe  months wasnut easy per se but it worked and wasnut as terrible as all the times i ucquitud without it smoke free almost  years now best wishes
 don't forget your wellbutrin you're severe without it but apprehension never goes away; companionship is ever out of reach
 my wellbutrin is what i have to get filled uddude0 nnyeah it may or may not get me through  but i donut wanna consider how my  would be going without it lol
 me accepting my award for uc days without a mental breakdownudniud like to thank remeron thru whom all things are possible to the love of my life buspar we did it baby big credit to my old friends at ssris and benzos wellbutrin you were there at the begi music swells
 heard of wellbutrin? itus a mild antidepressant in a different class than the heavy hitters nlifts the fog helps me dig out of holes and weight really falls off without even exercising my husband started taking it and lost like  pounds nnjust my personal experience )

 lol how does a person get wellbutrin without ever having to see a doctor
 hu am i kidding i dont know how to function without wellbutrin and cymbalta udeuddudeudduddude
 wellbutrin is just mdma without the dancing and coke without the snorting (literally the only good part of coke)
 so if there was something like that which my primary care doctor's network (who prescribes most of my meds) used it might but wouldn't have to and this other doctor from another office (who prescribed the wellbutrin) wouldn't have access to it without my signing a form to allow
 you so deserve to bennwithout my escitalopram and wellbutrin i probably woulduve killed myself
 wellbutrin is all fun and games until you donut take it for a week and then you start taking it again and it makes it so you cant eat anything without feeling like ur gonna throw up and also you get insane anxiety over absolutely nothing lt; ium having a great time obviously

 so stressed out ium considering stopping my wellbutrin for a few days so that i can smoke some cigs without getting nauseous

 wellbutrin really didn't do much for me but apparently it did allow me to combat intrusive thoughts because the last week without it has been hell i've been trying since yesterday to get my homework done and i'm still here on twitter for why?? send help
 jumping in here sorry if its rude ive been told by the entire world that vyvanse was better than adderall amp; that it would help me focus without all of the side effects but it just keeps me awake without any productivity taking it with wellbutrin might have been a big miss steak

 the allergies here awful i wouldnut survive without zyrtec
 i've been stuck on trips sleep overs etc where i've had to explain my sudden and dire need to get to a cvs the easiest way to explain the issue is saying jokingly i'm addicted the zyrtec it's a bit embarrassing this to admit but it's really true i cant live without it

 xyzal i have a crap ton of allergies and this has been the number one works like benadryl without knocking you out
 rhinocort (budesonide) and xyzal (levocetirizine) brah without it i  would have asphyxiated on my own snot back in lima and i would still rather live there than charlottesville
 ium allergic too but when our kitty needed to be rescued we stepped up to take him and i bought shares in the makers of xyzal (not really but i do take it every day) i canut imagine life without him 
 i was just about to type this i switch mine up i'm also using xyzal i've also had to use benezryl lately for immediate relief my body hates me and i'm currently without the ability to taste or smell
 i took it and then the generic version for years without drowsy issue then my allergies bulked up and the medicine stopped working switched to xyzal which has been much better (though not as effective as zyrtec had been)
 my allergist once told me that xyzal was the same as zyrtec without the thing that makes you tired so i guess it does that was when xyzal was still prescription and zyrtec just went over the counter so i switched to xyzal

 i tried to last a little longer than usual without my daily zyrtec for the spring i waited a day too long this me right now 
 but yeah too much antihistamines does that to me too  it's part of why i've been using antihistamines delivered through eyedrops and nasal spray  if that's what's bothering me i can get relief without adding claritin and benedryl to the zyrtec (for example)
 i take singulair flonase and zyrtec daily have for a decade cannot live without them

 i switched to xyzal last night and despite having the worst slogan and ad ever i haven't felt this good in weeks i slept through the night without sneezy feelingitchy throat 
 generic claritin itus not perfect but i notice a huge difference if i run out or forget to take itnni canut take benadryl or zyrtec without being knocked out for hrs; ium such a lightweight i also tried xyzal and didnut notice a difference to justify the higher price
 xyzal for allergiesnnunfortunately no antihistamine works as well for me now but taking one revolutionized my lifennwho knew you could exercise without intense itching??
 xyzal is an allergy med my dr prescribes and also can now be purchased over the counter it has helped me better than any other brands without making me drowsy feel bad or increased bp thought iud pass this along
 iuve been doing flonase  xyzal for a couple years which has worked relatively well taken in the morning without drowsiness nothing worked for me before that
 nothing was helping me and the dr recommended xyzal it seems to work without knocking me out
 now that ium dealing with springtime pollen without my regular allergy shots ium realizing how much theyuve been helping i feel like shit even with zyrtec i wonder when iull be able to start them again
 allergies are the worst the pollen count here has been high for like ever nowudeuddso ready for some relief i'm with your mom wouldn't make it without my zyrtec and flonaseuddude0(not too big on eye drops though) sending love and peace to you 
 you might need to switch up occasionally zyrtec works the best for me  and a shot of flonase daily i get both knock offs at costcoi would die without them every day donut forget youull not struggle again
 it doesn't make me sleepy unless i pair it with aspirin (which is also why nyquil works ) i find that zyrtec and flonase both work well without making me sleepy

 etc and the cycle keeps repeating without a good washout period i also haven't been taking my allergy meds like i should i didn't like the side effects but thankfut xyzal seems to be working well for me without making me tired

 every morning without fail  i'm thinking this is iti've got it pop a zyrtec  find relief and repeat the next day the mental games of this pandemic are something else
 itus amazing what one day without zyrtec will do to you
 xyzal is the new hotness  basically zyrtec without the side effects supposedly
 went to the doctor to get my prescriptions changed took myself to cvs and holy cow without insurance that stuff would've cost  just for nasal spray and xyzal this would cost so much less anywhere else
 do you take antihistimines regularly? (claritinbenadrylallegraxyzal and many others) if not you may want to consider a low dose without the decongestant (its a stimulant) but always ask your local pharmacist for advice before starting something new
 i have somehow gone from ucno real allergiesud to uca day without zyrtec means burning eyes and miseryud and i do not like it at least costco's kirkland knockoff is cheap
 xyzal is the new hotness  basically zyrtec without the side effects supposedly
 i would probably not increase dosage without consulting my doc but if it is for example a over the counter zyrtec i would take two or three no problem
 i just spent about  minutes reading about this  iuve never heard of it even  being uc relatively mild uc seems to be too much  i too hope the zyrtec can help without aggravating anything else i do hope it helps a little bit 
 except claritin is antihistamine (nd gen just means it doesnut cross the bloodbrain barrier as readily so less drowsiness) ndiphen st gen  sleepy nboth have anticholinergic effects tho (drying up your nose)nzyrtec amp; allegra are antih without anticholinergic activity
 i've had better luck with zyrtec than the others works without the drowsiness good luck surprise discovery i take the kid version my son uses and it's just as good as the adult dose
 another rct of hcq shows no benefit thatus  in the last month and i believe  consecutive studies  nnno clinical data for pepcid or zyrtec except a cohort study without a control group (and we know how predictive those were for hcq)

 get educated on the existing objective scientific evidence and do not get vaccinated  tamiflu and other drugs like it are a danger to all living beings without extreme specialist training and education most me amp; other chronic illnesses are likely a result of vaccine injury
 most hospitals donut let you leave without seeing any improvement regardless she was given a prescription to keep it from getting worse tamiflu is used to keep it from progressing to something worse
 there's also the issue that tamiflu is expensive and often times insurance doesn't cover it even if you happen to be lucky enough to have insurance   it's typically  minimum with insurance  a lot more without
 you can definitely mix tylenol and tamiflu? theyure completely different medications without interactions
 when the flu can kill with it without tamiflu
 yes and then take tamiflu the combo together makes it milder for me i have only gotten it a few times with shot but was a difference with and without pills other household members skipped pills and got hit harder i think it does help  some and not others
 tamiflu is not a vaccine and does not contain any active or inactive virus it's an antiviral that is often administered in severe flu cases severe flu can cause death with or without the tamiflu
 no one is arguing that tamiflu is for everyonewithout severe side effects chemotherapy is also not recommended to the general public and even some actual cancer patients the whole point of this dang thread is that sometimes you gotta weigh awful side effects against death
 well with tamiflu your symptoms will last  days without it it could be two weeks
 the only insane people here are this brandy woman the nbc and all the rabbied followers who couldn't wait two seconds to spew hate on this poor woman without knowing the facts besides tamiflu has never helped one living soul

 it's not exactly as presented she didn't give a vaccine or tamiflu those are true but the  yo collapsed suddenly without serious symptoms she was at the group asking about the other children (and got terrible advice but didn't actually follow it from any report)
 exactly to me moms decision to not pursue treatment when it became obvious the natural remedies werenut working is worse then not giving him the a tamiflu to begin with he could have still been saved possibly even without tamiflu if mom has just acted sooner

 ium guessing you realize tamiflu isnut without risk and he mightuve died anyway youure a mother amp; you damn sure ought to know better than to say something like this to another momma
 oh well if you survived just fine without the tamiflu then i guess that child didn't die either
 yes and we've also both survived just fine without the tamiflu
 good  my grandson had a terrible reaction to tamiflu  the flu symptoms were easily managed without it and it was thrown in the trash  research it you'll see
 this is fucking awful nnpeople who actively take herbology studies seriously  (myself included) are always the first to say 'go to your doc and listen' people riding fad lifestyles feeding misinformation without education absolutely horrifying 
 well everyone seems to be mad that she might not have given the kid tamiflu it is possible to hydrate and get electrolytes without using tamiflu
 not using the tamiflu would directly have contributed to his death tamiflu prevents the spread of the flu to advise someone against using that is practicing medicine without a license  and should be treated as so nnare you anti vaccine?
 nbc reports that members of the ucstop mandatory vaccinesud groupmasscontact parents whose children have died and suggest without evidence that vaccines may be to blame give these fuckers the walln
 the large risk estimates for a mortality outcome justify rcts because causality cannot be excluded where is the long term safety data? tamiflu should not have been approved without itnn
 my son had the flu this past week two urgent cares and one  hour emergency room stay and doctors from all three places said elderberry syrup is more effective against the flu than tamiflu without the nasty side effects same as zinc and tamiflu it only works in the first hrs

 you should at least look into going to a walgreens little clinic much less expensive even without insurance and they should be able to diagnose younnnot everything can be ridden out the flu can kill you you may need tamiflu if it's that bad
 i just read that that particular story was published without interviewing the mom the mom did give her kid the tamiflu
 the issue is whether tamiflu is the right medical decision but nowhere in this article or your comments do you explore this valid concerns or not? instead you waive around potato socks in an attempt to dismiss the concern as crazy without any facts at all
 shocker ucdrud pan pointing this out and not doing his homework just like the journalist journalist writes an article without interviewing the mother who just lost her child she says she did give tamiflu but the facts donut matter they want to attack a grieving mom way go 
 neuropsychiatric events have been reported during administration of tamiflu in patients with influenza especially in children and adolescents these events are also experienced by patients with influenza without tamiflu administration
 agreed but the point could have been made without calling her out my ped doesnut recommend tamiflu (a urmc doc) so how is this different?
 agreed the cost of the tamiflu without insurance is literally less than  of what her go fund me is asking for the worst part is now that a child has passed and most likely another these antivaxxers will still press forward with their message
 tamiflu is dangerous  vaccines aren't safe or effective  the immune system is stronger without them have a blessed day and week yourself 
 her son had a freakin seizure from the flu and she refused to give him tamiflu?? a seizure did she even give him antipyretics such as tylenol and ibuprofen? hydrate? i would do everything to ensure my kids could survive without damage just wown
 this is terrible  please please please do not take any medical advice from anyone except a licensed medical professional  you see stuff like this in the ms world too do not make any changes to your healthcare regimen without consulting your doctor 
 tamiflu came up at the bus stop one morning ium happy to report that none of my neighbors are idiots because the consensus without any dissent was yes you should take it if your doctor prescribes it
 wtf i would call cps if these kids were my patients mild case of the flu is usually fine without tamiflu but temps that high and febrile seizures you better be giving the meds
 the point is that even if she thought it would give him side effects there is no side effect it could have given him that would be worse than having him die without being given tamiflu a chance there is no cure for death
 even without tamiflu they likely should have been in the hospital under observation probably getting iv fluids at the very least
 people who churn out medical advice without proper qualifications  and people who accept them  need to be punishednnyearold dies after facebook antivaxxers advise mother to put potatoes in his socks instead of giving him tamiflu  
 this says if you give tamiflu within  hours it reduces symptoms (by  ) reducing duration of the flu by one day nnlots of severe side effects some parents might not want to risknnletus not demonize parentswithout all the factsnn
 this is an awful tragedy driven by antivaxxers preying on parents online it should go without saying that we should never rely on the internet for health and medical advice please get yourself amp; your kids vaccinated for flu publichealthn
 look at the research on tamiflu itus not recommended for children that young  the risks out weight the benefits  i listened to a nurse practitioner at a minute clinic  my  year old kept throwing up without other signs of flu b (test  for) amp; liver count went very high
 tamiflu is not a vaccination also that article below is interesting to read you put very hard judgement and blame on a mother who just lost her child without (knowing?) and telling the whole story ni am not an anti vaxxer or n
 i read that she did in fact give her child the tamiflu and then the child died the media wrote that article without ever interviewing the mother
 although she should have given her son the tamilfu most people can recover from the flu on their own without it itus very unlucky for the mom and kid that he died i donut think they even prescribe tamiflu if youure not seen in the first two days of getting the flu
 to see how msm spreads hate against opponents of pharma check out article pharma funds nbc news  so she suggests without proof that child died because mom got true fact on smv about tamiflu another shameful misuse of a family tragedy for pharma profit
 also the kid literally died without taking tamiflu what does that tell you? (hint it means the flu can lead to death so the correlation of tamiflu  tylenol and flu death is literally just a spurious correlation go take basic statistics)
 tamiflu makes my kids throw up so if they get prescribed it which my daughter did last week when she had the flu she didn't take it dr even said if didn't want it it wasn't required and  days later she is back and healthy without it
 okay cause and effect here c'mon tamiflu causes the psychosis that causes the suicide the psychosis wouldn't have happened without the tamiflu so what does that mean? the tamiflu caused the suicide and therefore did kill someone but you can believe what you will udeudduduufe0f
 to be fair she refused without the group suggesting she not get the tamiflu filled does the group need to be closed (or marked as fake news?)? probably but fb probably won't do that
 mike she didnut say prescription  not sure a pediatrician would rx tamiflu without examining the child she said they called dr they are heart broken and this is tragic and all the facts are not there the flu is devastating and too many take it too lightly
 nah there was no opinion or time since we were at ane hence we were against it bcos when we went up to the wards the doctors were shocked that tamiflu were given without influenza
 but thats exactly how the system works? my daughter was prescribed tamiflu without even being tested positive for influenza? how now brown cow? 
 i had a short duration ( hours symptomatic )influenza a last weekend i had a shot and tamiflu ium still coughing and worn out but without iud likely just get getting over acute symptoms and have infected my entire family their flu shots protected them from me
 tamiflu is just as effective as potatoes in socks just so you know people die from complications from flu those complications develop with or without taking tamiflu tamiflu  day better at drawing flu to an end itus garbage vaccineeeeeee is uddudd not tamiflu
 this tamifluoils amp; elderberry situation is sad i donut get the flu vaccine even though i work with kids (for my own personal reasoning) amp; i do use oils amp; elderberry but ium not against using tamiflu etc i wish that mom had used her own instinct without consulting facebook
 i gave my kids tamiflu once and never again they barfed up a storm from it it's really hard on their tummies it's not a vaccine or antibiotic it just maybe helps the flu go away faster no one knows whether the kid would have survived with or without it sad all around
 you can be hesitant about a medication without being an antivaxxer many doctors are skeptical about the efficacy of tamiflu
 doctors do not prescribe drugs like tamiflu without solid reason to do so this child dead because of potato in the sock quackery (seriously wtf??)and any antivaxxers want to argue this i gladly will come to your house and smack you upside the head for being stupid 
 while medicine isnt always right and tamiflu isnt without complications its also fair to say that going to social media to get advice like take peppermint oil or lavendar for the flu from complete strangers while ignoring your doctor is not a good idea either
 did i say not to take tamiflu? no nnand homeopathy is not merely essential oils udeuddudcudffeuduufe0f wish ppl would research before poopooing other modalities of medicine nnalso you can do both homeopathic and modern medicine without generally any negative effects
 the mother should be charged with child abuseneglect that's not to say this child wouldn't have died without tamiflu or proper medical intervention but she withheld the care any reasonable person would provide their child i only hope she now speaks out about the antivaxxers
 i thought they was anti vaccine tamiflu isnut even vaccine itus a drug?? if yuall get on some antimedicine vibes next ium donennmedicine has saved my life multiple times now i literally would have been dead at the age of  without it yuall need to be criminally charged
 i was told by a doctor that tamiflu is dangerous he told me to get my son elderberry syrupit works faster and without side effectsto keep my kid hydrated and resting told me uci didnut tell you that i could lose my licenseud
  years of age is not an infant ntamiflu is extremely effective in this situation of exposure with minimal risk of side effects nit is sad that this child died it is sadder that those without any expertise are perpetuating a lie that potatoes in socks is a flu treatment
 this is nothing more than a hit piece tamiflu can have serious side effects the child may have died with or without taking the tamiflu do you work for the pharmaceutical industry?
 in all fairness in standard cases tamiflu only helps you get over the flu  day faster than you normally would without it thatus for children and adults so usually tamiflu is prescribed because doctors feel they have to give you something
 correction she dismissed the tamiflu with a prescription but most people (healthy) survive the flu without itus just longer
 she did seek medical attention u he was hospitalized she decided to turn down the tamiflu thatus not a radical decision itus not without its own dangers and downsides itus not black and white
 on facebook antivaxxers urged a mom not to give her son tamiflu he later diednnsomething needs to be done about all the misinformation people are spreading without proof of facts vaccineswork antivaxxers kill vaccinateyourkids vaccines  
 absolutely put the tamiflu to the side for a secondbig picture is no child that has a seizure or temp of  should be left without supervision of medical professionals
 as a journalist itus a little irresponsible to say ucaccording to medical researchud without citing any actual research isnut that fair to say? iuve done my research on the efficacy of tamiflu have you?
 they gave her tamiflu without having the flu? ium sorry ium confused by this
 i had the flu last year and i was prescribed tamiflu and it worked wonders donut know what i woulduve done without it
 members told her not to take the tamiflu a doctor had prescribed but give him oils and elderberries and put potatoes in his socks  shameful  tragic  don't practice medicine without a goddam license   
 i got the flu vaxx amp; so did my family yesterday i took my husband to the er after he passed out today son spiked a fever influenza a we are all on tamiflu without the vaccine amp; rx we would be much should not be the platform of medical misinformation  
 my provax doctor explained to me that with or without tamiflu the virus has to run its course regardless
 attacking antivaxxers like they attacked tsla   the flu kills thousands of americans per year with or without tamiflu
 umm doctor would my child was on it prescribed postdx and i  personally grateful i know without a shadow of doubt my kiddo avoided pneumonia and worse symptoms because of the tamiflu
 doctor prescribed tamiflu without a flu diagnosis  either the prescription or the diagnosis was wrongpushing mom to make a judgement call on a drug that doesnut have a great success rate
 hard to not give the tamiflu a doctor had prescribed without seeing an actual medical professional (and then choosing to ignore their advice over that of some morons on facebook)
 the oft quoted statistic of just one day less is underestimating the effectiveness of tamiflu because it comes from studies that included patients without test confirmed influenza and started  days after onset of symptoms
 test for admitted ptsni try not to give tamiflu to people without pneumonia and hospitalizationnntesting notwithstanding about  rx's to cause vomiting with a benefit of lessening sx by less than a daynnreally sick? i will kitchensink you riskbenefit now in yr favor
 i am not impressed with presumed influenza  and prescription tamiflu without a formal swabnalso no test for anything else despite convention attendancenmehni'm out of here
 i agree with you although am very cautious about applying the retrospective results  people given tamiflu are likely very different from those withoutnfine with giving it until we see the rct but we desperately need the rct
 they actually prescribed the tamiflu for aaron without me taking him in hallelujah
 did you get tamiflu? i got nye and was vomiting like those partying without the fun side of the party
 tamiflu go to a clinic or call your dr my daughter took it and did not get as sick as i did without it
 the fatality rate might be under  (not counting the ppl who died without confirming novel coronavirus infection) why risk the lives of immunocompromised patients or elderlies or children tho? ncov doesn't have a cure unlike influenza that can be treated with tamiflu
 only because we keep using it without questionnnwe had  trials showing a mortality benefit from hypothermia after cardiac arrest  better data that we have ever had for tamiflunand yet we still have multiple follow up massive multicenter rctsntime for the same for tamiflu
 like those flu types without vaccines developed there is no direct treatment for coronarivus it's isolation and supportive treatment onlynnthis was same for sarsvirus and mers tamiflu was used to treat the symptoms however
 drugs developed to combat viral infections are subject to scam as you cannot really asses it until it is in action take the tamiflu case most people who recovered using this med actually recovered without its help
 tweet of janconspiracy of pharmaindustry like birdflu fear spread by roche to sell antiviral medicine tamiflu  countries purchased this medicine later on it expired without use with billions of dollars earned by roche  
 that's 000 people dead with a  vax rate tamiflu and lesscontagious virusesnnwhat do you think is going to happen without those advantages?
 can jnj confirm clinical data wil be made public? hopefully not a repeat of the tamiflu scandal?  stockpiling a drug without having (or providing) concrete proof that the therapeutic benefits outweigh the risk of harm not a great idea transparency is important i'm not anti vax

 you can be tested for the flu at you doctors office and be put on tamiflu without going to the hospital
 i've had the flu without a flu shot but with tamiflu i've had the flu with a flu shot for a different strain they were very different experiences
 chinesevirus  nexus fakenewsmedia  makenews on coronabondnndignostic kits testing positive on recovered patients shows the vested interest to track test amp; treat an invisible enemy without symptoms like they did for selling hn's tamiflunn
 thatus an argument without basis we stockpile all sorts of things from grit to fuel to tamiflu thereus a balance between prevention  resilience nnif the risk assessment warrants it we appear broadly to spend on it the real issue here is the risk assessment didnut warrant it
 quite likely then it was it with tamiflu it lasts like a week without that it lingers for like  days very miserable condition body ache high grade fever sweats weekness
 no it doesnut but it does free up a test for someone with no explanation for their critical illness you can still take precautions without a test (they are the same for flu and covid) the management is the same too (tamiflu is garbage) how would your management change? 
 there is a medicine named tamiflu but not for the covid in anticipation  and under influence of rumors do not take any medication without a physician's prescription
 ium  sure i had this back in late januaryearly february after i had the flu nniud finished my tamiflu went a few days without fever or symptoms then i had a cough and low grade fever and chest tightness for about a week nnif i can be tested for antibodies i want to be
 that was bad but keeping teachers staff and thousands of children inside a building in winter without even windows open while a highly contagious pathogenic virus no one has been vaccinated against and for which thereus no uc tamifluud type drug  is beyond reckless amp;stupid
 well with me my doctor always says to come in so they can test me for the flu they wonut just administer tamiflu or something like that without testing me for the flu first
 easter math lesson k dieyear from flu covid is x deadlier so only k die right? nnbut k is with a working antiviral (tamiflu) and flu vaccines without them how many flu deaths? k? nnso x that number for let's just go back to work
 i agree sam i have added wrightia tinctoria with high correlation with tamiflu (but without side effects) n
 fox news is bullshitting hydroxychloroquine for whatever reason and i can prove it you take tamiflu before you get the flu so that you don't get it you take a vaccine so you become immune from the flu without ever getting it
 but wouldnut these ucfluud patients have tested positive for flu? without that same as with covid they wouldnut call it a diagnosis and add it to the numbers if they test positive for flu they can be given tamiflu but that doesnut work for covid
 it should go without saying (but i'll say it anyway) that i sincerely hope that it is announced that quinine or tamiflu stops virus and that the death rate in uk and italy returns to precovid next week and nobody is proved right
 i think you could get even benzos without prescription in this country tbhnnbut are you sure doctors are sending? cuz even the government is saying there is no prophylactic use of hqc for sarscov for treatment though from what i've heard and seen it's tamifluhqc
 honestly its ridiculous people hoarding drugs they will probably not need the vast majority if infected can fight off this disease without anything just because you get the flu doesnt mean you take tamiflu  same applies here if you really need this the hospital will give it
 no they gave tamiflu and sent me home no test nothing i was literally there for  minutes they diagnosed me with the flu without any test at the time thatus what i and others thought cause the coronavirus wasnut making news yet i was out of work for a week and a cough for 
 i doubt it could be purchased at the moment it'll have been requisitioned i know exports have been banned nni worked in a pharmacy through sars and hn sars we were given trained to hand tamiflu out without prescription if the shit hit the fan thankfully it never did
 just found had coronavirus during a check up i had recent sars on my lungs i was sick in brazil a month ago doctor said i had virul infection and upper respiratory infection he gave me tamiflu and anti boitics  i was out for  days wouldnt have made it without that medication
 my mate had a severe chest problem which doctors couldn't identify but responded to tamiflu without hospitalisation i think this was just before christmas he could barely breathe and had a high fever xxx
 maybe for someone else they could skip the amoxicillin and protect other people from exposure if testing was actually available without the shit criteria and for me maybe i just need some tamiflu or elderberry ue
 it's been so hard not to visit with my parents but it's for the best they both were really sick for about  week and went to the urgent care they gave them tamiflu without checking what they had
  for reference my son actually had the flu  years previous and he got through it easy without any complaints he did go on tamiflu though on day  or  of showing symptoms whatever this was it was worse on both of us than any flu we've had
 so you admit you have no idea what youure talking about? you said without tamiflu or vaccines the flu is x more deadly than covid but the is no data to support your claim here is the data to support mine 
 i used an app called doctor on demand to videochat with a doctor and got a prescription called in without having to go to a medical facility  is dopennused the same app to get tamiflu when i had the flu earlier in the season

 good and worrisome questions that is the thing about stockpiles the products wear out and have to be budgeted for again as they are replaced the big battle i faced was on n masks as the norm at great expense and we stockpiled a lot of tamiflu that likely went without use
 mr ninfluenza virus (flu) has a vaccine already and regular treatment is available using tamiflu (oseltamivir) while covid doesnut have a vaccine or any treatment yet without radical measures such as lock downsquarantine a lot more people would die 
 they gave you tamiflu without testing positive for the flu? itus the combo of motrin and tamiflu that will make you feel worsetamiflu has a host of bad side effects
 thank you for that but 000 isnut all the flu cases for that year i had flu diagnosed twice without get a lab done  time was even over video call prescribed tamiflu both times amp; responded to medicationnnso the number you need to work w is at minimum all diagnosed
 i'm not talking about testing for covid i'm talking about testing for the flu they told him he had the flu and sent him home with tamiflu without even checking if it was the flu that's never best practice because tamiflu doesn't help if it's bacterial
 if you go find the dude's thread which i'm not going to link to so he doesn't get swamped the hospital did screw up a good bit too the first time he went to the er they told him he had the flu and sent him home with tamiflu without actually swabbing him to confirm it was flu 
 doctors don't bother with tests for the flu they treat your symptoms and avoid testing being denied by the insurance  what can they give you for the flu tamiflu? ni've been diagnosed with pneumonia with and without an xray antibiotics and i'm good this isn't either of those
 but are they prescribing tamilflu yet without confirmation? tamiflu was supposedly going to be released otc later this year does the company that makes it have stockpile sitting in warehouses ready to go?
  got to urgent care chest xray showed no pneumonia diagnosed with presumptive flu without being tested  sent home with tamiflu prescription and symptom mitigation over the counter meds  lasted a full  days slowly improving
 my doc visit and flu a test cost me  of course i havenut met my deductible so that cash out of pocket she wouldnut just prescribe tamiflu without seeing me
 i donut have insurance so i canut afford to go to the doctor thereus a place nearby thatull check you out without insurance and doesnut cost a lot but i know theyud just prescribe me tamiflu which i wouldnut be able to afford even if i had insurance
 i have a friend same thing didn't travel though but md gave tamiflu over the phone without having been tested for flu went to urgent care several days later and got breathing treatment and a steroid still not tested now running around town and lives with  yr old mother
 i got it and they gave me tamiflu but i went back to school without finishing the course for it and then when they were about to give me the hpv vaccine they were like ucany meds youure taking we should know about?ud and i was like ucahud
 mr please donot spread these kind of inform until fda approved this is the job of health care providers in your tweet threads people tweeting about tamiflu and etc etc please be responsible citizens donot spread any information without 
 last tweet for this thread but a month ago i had caught the flu and when i went to urgent care they wanted to give me tamiflu without even testing me for the flu during a pandemic that has flu like symptoms? i had to argue to get tested for the flu the fucking incompetence
 also upmc done lost itus damn mind tamiflu for my kid shouldnut be this much ever heus likely to end up with pneumonia without this we can afford it but it stings ium horrified that there are families who would send this back medicareforall 
 take care i hope you can get the tamiflu without too much pfaff tomorrow
 we were discussing this in the pharmacy last week so many patients prescribed cough suppressantsteroidalbuterol inhaler without tamiflu or antibiotic this season  soso many uddude
 i had hn was able to take tamiflu and recover without issues and i am immunosuppressed currently we have an administration hell bent on covering up numbers not providing tests and generally not taking it seriously until the stock market crashed covid 
 noooo they never tested dallas for the flu when he was hospitalized but told him he had it other similar anecdotal things from friends and coworkers about being sent home with tamiflu without a test we all just had fever cough (which i still have) and chillsweakness
 hospitals will reach capacity  times faster than the growth of the gravely ill patients why? because those who progress to the critical stage need a  week stay under heavy treatment most antivirals do not really work against covid tamiflu works for flu without vaccine 
 stfu until youuve walked in my shoes i had hn in  three weeks so very ill i didnut recognize my own children thankful i had my flu shot i was given tamiflu within  days ium very grateful ium alive without those treatments i would have died educate your loved onesuddudc
 why is tamiflu not available without a prescription in this country? any one know
 kids in my school district are sick and noone has tests they're being prescribed tamiflu without being seen by a doctor and being told to stay away unless they're sick for more than three weeks it's all a pack of lies of course the tests cost nothing they don't exist
 it doesn't give a difference in treatment necessarily although medications like tamiflu may be infact started sooner it does make a difference on whether a person without symptoms but testing positive would be quarantined as not to spread the virus
 advice nurse tells me i have the flu and to call my doc in the morning if i want tamiflu my fever gets to  and i take advil and try to sleep call doc in am who calls in a prescription for tamiflu my fever stays at  all day without any meds
 i remember going to the pharmacy  days after falling sick with a mask on the poor employee was  months pregnant and terrified she thanked me for wearing a mask because people were coming to buy tamiflu without mask it's people unresponsive that make it bad udeuddc
 will a product like this actually be a solid longterm play?  good pr for in the shortrun but without huge potential customers (those infected) it won't have the same business generation as something like tamiflu  
 your pcp can write you prescriptions without seeing you i was sent tamiflu (to reduce severity) amoxicillin (to prevent pneumonia) and chloroquine (a prophylactic) they can assess your level of care needed wo a trip to the er or admit you directly to a hospital if needed
 thank god for insurance dr prescribed tamiflu and albuterol without insurance  i paid 
 now it's after office hours  my husband was at work very very inconvenient for everyone  so i called him home and called the doc's after hours helpline and gotnnmy own doctornno frabjous day  calloo callaynnhe believed me without hesitation and called in the tamiflu
 thereus medication to treat not but since itus not fda approve your have rotations submit special paperwork that says your so sick you will die without at least trying to see if this medication will work your basic tamiflu will not work
 oh ok that was the punchline i guess it wasnut that funny uddude0 but i guess my point wasis i had the flu amp; was prescribed tamiflu and still felt horrible so i canut imagine me (or anyone) having corona without some kinda prescribed antiviral meds udeuddudeuddudeudd
 get well soon  thx for sharing a good opportunity to remind folks itus not too late to get flu vaccine and tamiflu can reduce likelihood that contacts become infectedubut i think the pupper will be ok without it
 i started getting sick sunday still have a fever of  i couldnut even buy cold medicine today without getting the side eye by the entire cvs  should i go to the doctor to get a flu test and tamiflu so iull be strong enough to fight off coronavirus? udeuddmaddow lastword
 if a person has a cough that tamiflu didnt take care of and are still running a fever what should a person do? doctors offices have e some pretty sick patients and dozens are in er's where can someone be tested without spreading to dozens more?
 that we know of; weuve responded poorly with testing supplies people can be asymptomatic for days and spread it without even knowing and thatus what makes it dangerous without these precautions itud be like going an entire flu season without a vaccine or tamiflu
 two years ago i got the flu and it was horrendous and that was with a flu vaccine and tamiflu i canut imagine going through it without anything
 flu but without tamiflu isn't a terrible comparison which is more than frightening enough for me
 the doctor today spoke to me about considering to not get tamiflu after i tested positive for flu he was very kind but his reasoning was that it costs the clinic  to give someone without insurance the medicine on the low income slide program he didn't try to persuade me
 yes indeedy tamiflu is not without its limitations  but it's better than nothing )  i've seen so much misinformation about covid not least from trump who keeps calling it 'corona flu'  but 'influenza is not a virus' is a new one on me
 what? why would they just give you tamiflu without seeing if you really have the flu or not?
 again the idiocy will never endnthis is the fastest pandemic evernonce the hospital bed are full we will die at home without icunlet alone the lack of antiviral drugs ntamiflu antiviral drugs here in australia have only be allocated to private clinicsnlock down now 
 man these doctors better set up a trailer amp; catch these patients once they hop out the car get them vitals amp; send them home cause ainut shit you can do without a cure tamiflu ainut gone do shit
 probably a  influenza type virus spliced with killer strandnntamiflu       days treatment helps recovery nncohort of        recovered without hospitalization  all now ok
 related i know many people are being turned away from covidufc testing are you requesting tamiflu? we had something awful around christmas amp; were put on tamiflu amp; augmentin i can only imagine how much worse it would have been without those 
 tamiflu is not yet available without a prescription
 there no preventive  tamiflu may help what is bad is contagious without showing yet does have higher mortality rate then common flu so now take precautions before it does get out of hand  like putting soda and covering up a grease fire get out of hand
 the common flu has a vaccine and tamiflu just think what the numbers would look like without that???  also the death rate is much lower the comparison between the two is dangerous
 that many people died with a vaccine and tamiflu medication so how many deaths will you have on your hands without either one you piece of shit?
 i got flu for the first time at  in the middle of summer in dubai got tamiflu then i moved back to sa  mo later and got a slightly different strain without asking i got tamiflu again wouldn't say i'm a risk category? perhaps it is walking the same route as antibiotics
 yes this doesnut matter if you have it or not just the idea gets the same treatment just like we in the er treat the flu we give tamiflu without even testing even though the test is readily available
 went last sunday to one of the kidz zones now the entire house but me has the flu we all had gotten our flu shotsearlier this season still got the flu went and picked up tamiflu for everyone if tamiflu lessens the severity hate to see what the flu is like without it
 either you stocked up on tamiflu which you can't do without a prescription and would be irresponsible or you stocked up on a homeopath medicine which is at best a placebo
 most people recover from flu without resort to something like tamiflu and most people will recover from covid you don't have to be quarantined in a hospital you can selfquarantine at home if mildly sick but it is important to be tested so we can determine the spread
 i def have suspicions but i hate to speculate too much without evidencennremember rumsfeldus investment in tamiflu?nni donut put anything past them
 i wonder if it will also make people realise what a world without effective antibiotics will look like as we confront the first illness in a long time with zero treatment options even in swine flu there was tamiflu to give people
 i had it last year  i went in on day  or  and the dr said stick it out cause tamiflu will make you feel worse than what you feel without it udeudduduufe0fuddudef
 i have to take tamiflu (for the flu not for tami) and it says you have to take with food so you donut throw up so iuve just been basically eating non stop for  days without stopping
  seem less reasonable guesstimates to me and that is without factoring in potential therapeutics influenza has only tamiflu looks like several anecdotally good possibilities for cov hoping chloroquine gets a positive response due to costavailability
 not yet dyinguddudennwithout treatment with remdesivir lopinavirritonavir tamiflu and alphainterpheron through nebulization the case fatality rate is around  or at least it was in wuhanuddudennchina is now mass producing remdesivir which is why their cfr is in single figures
 everyone gets tamiflu except me no dr will prescribe it without the swab  out of  in my household have tested positive i have noinsurance  drs still refuse to prescribe it flu 
 without a vaccine or tamiflulike treatment how does economic life recover?  nnsuspect usa would accept neither enforced quarantines nor the sacrifice of olderless healthy individuals what then?nnby when could the us have a tested manufactured and distributed treatment?
 its just like any cold or flu virusit just lasts  days without any treatments if fever is lowered with medicines or tamiflu is administered then it grows aggressivelyamp; might become deadly for elderlykids amp; immunity suppressed people only less than  fatalityfear is created
 iuve actively taking ibuprofen on top of the prednisone tamiflu a cough thing and i donut know i still have a temp even when the ibuprofen brings it down canut imagine how high it would be without it
 (most were confirmed by flu swab like my spouse my doctor's office just went ahead and gave me tamiflu when i came down with symptoms without bothering with another swab)
 i was discharged on nye still on iv antibiotics to complete at home i'm oversharing not for sympathy but because i really don't want to go through this again anytime soon  especially without an antiviral like tamiflu please try and protect others by washing your hands n
 what would the chart of the flu look like without the vaccine and tamiflu?
 think of it like getting the flu and being given tamiflu to take at home to lessen the severity as opposed to roughing it out yourself without any medication and the only option is you're sick enough to be admitted to the hospital
 just thought iud point out that an estud k americans died of influenza and its complications during the winter of  and thatus with a vaccine and tamiflu weure at k covid deaths without either time to open the country like now
 what eventually came out is that the who recommended tamiflu without seeing underlying clinical trial data the ema amp; cdc approved tamiflu also without vetting the underlying data the cdc approved the drug based on a  page rochesponsored paper alone badpharma
 both require immunity which isnt the case with covid  people are recovering then testing positive again and again i believe our saving grace will be testing and a treatment like tamiflu without covid immunity neither a vaccine nor herd immunity will help
 if you read the bmj timeline there never was good evidence tamiflu worked and years of legal obfuscation to release trial data agencies like ema and who approved and recommended without ever vetting the data this was covered well in 's book bad pharma
 is a failure there are many drugs with cardiac side effects which are prescribed without monitoring why have you restricted the use of hcq a safe widely used drug which is theoretically most effective early like tamiflu amp; is used other countries for covid prophylaxis?
 if antivirals like tamiflu work best when administered as early as possible why are hydroxychloroquine studies using it as a uchail maryud and without zinc? udeudduduufe0f
 the  years of flu related death totals that are now compressed into a  week period of related amounts why should we add on not fear but reality of this contagion without remedy of medication (tamiflu) or inoculation mediation best practice stay home don't spread
 move forward to what? without testing an asymptomatic carrier can infect a multitude of people who then overwhelm the healthcare systemuntil we have testing or an anti viral med (think tamiflu) we social distance wear masks and wash hands follow the experts and not crazies
 study was nonrandomized amp; may be fatally flawed as patients receiving hcq were likely to be sicker i think a similar nonrandomized study of flua pts managed with amp; without tamiflu would have similar finding (tamiflu group doing worse) only thing clear is hcq isn't a panacea
 i reasonably certain that if the va did a retrospective analysis of all influenza a patients managed with or without oseltamivir (tamiflu) the tamiflu group would fare worse  because they are sicker the only thing now clear is that hcq is not a panacea also (continuing) 
 yes it's tricky the treatment should be taken early on first symptoms it's like that tamiflu against flu for example no point in taking it when already hospitalized this means people must be tested early or treated without even testing of every symptomatic capacity
 the flu has a vaccine and remedies like tamifluthe flu is not nearly as contagious people can be asymptomatic and spread covid to others without ever knowing it
 think of how many would have died without a vaccine or tamiflu  i got hn vaccine ready a few weeks later  of course
 the risk of reinfection with covid is unclear  but with or without a vaccine antiviral drugs will be key  just as tamiflu is used to treat people with influenza a and b drugs like kaletra (usually used for hivaids) are being trialled for covid
 there is no cure or treatment for the flu more people die from influenza vaccines only cover  strains in the region you obtained the vaccinethere are meds such as tamiflu but it's not without its issues and it just lowers the amount of time your sick it's not a cure
 if you want a safe consistent vaccine that works without wildcard side effects from preclinical through phase iii testing with statistically significant p values then yep  months want to worry more? once they get something that works remember the tamiflu shortage?
 tamiflu helped me twice  reduced duration of the flu for me  had the flu before without tamiflu and i ran a fever for  days  with tamiflu it was only  days
 so x deadlier than the seasonal flu and without a vaccination and tamiflu ium relieved
 yep seasonal flu kills 000 each year and that's with a  vax rate and treatments including tamiflunnno vax  no treatments  three times as contagious  we're screwed without containment strategies
 ngl i feel like when the girls went to the hospital and the doctor said it was flu b without even testing them bc ucit might show a false negativeud and the tamiflu didnut do shit for themcorona may have been present 
 aren't we really just buying time for a vaccine or a tamiflu  without these  it's going to kill whoever it's chooses too just over a longer period  ventilators aren't saving many lives  if  years from now there is no vaccine the death toll will still be astronomical
 i went home with tamiflu which didnut help me at all my fever broke after  days but it took me a good  weeks to get rid of the coughlike i couldnut get a sentence out without coughing since this whole covid thing started
 this happened during the swine flu outbreak msm ubuy tamiflu we donut have enough tamiflu people will die without tamifluu two years later uwhat you wasted all that money buying tamiflu we didnut needu
 exactly this my household was sick and the only one that we took in was my  year old even after the doctor offered tamiflu (without testing) we declined  we just ride out the flu
 why would they laboratories are the setting to study this without boundaries in the tests themselves they cannot study this i think itus a bit more important to get this right then tamiflu you can get a flu shot for the flu in  months we ucmightud get one for covid
 imagine how much worse that would be without vaccines and treatment like tamiflu
 yup all the fluids and rest didn't help i was on tamiflu and hallucinating from days without sleep and breaking night
 i wonder how many people who were treated w tamiflu without getting flu tested (bc  and being told the treatment was the same regardless) this winter actually had covid 
 i just asked because people i know here in louisiana were given tamiflu without a flu test and they never got better they went back and it was actually covid why so hostile?
 my husband and coworkers as well everyone got sick after a christmas party it was brutal ours actually hit in january they were given tamiflu without a flu test symptoms seemed consistent so doctors thought udeuddudcudffeuduufe0f
 we can manage flu without shutting down society and the balance is in favour of that option people should be more careful of flu but the cost (human as well as economic) of managing it beyond vaccines tamiflu etc outweighs the benefit
 your assuming a vaccine for covid would be  effective amp; safenusers must have informed consentchoice of risk amp; benefitsntheyuve been trying to make a vaccine for coronaviruses without complete longterm success (ie common cold  sarscov) since pre nlookup tamiflu wiki
 decent people going to the grocery stores without masks if they're not wearing a mask they ain't decent since they don't care about protecting others tamiflu
 i suspect this will be the new tamiflu of covidclinical improvement in select patients without any effects on mortalitywill just have to wait and see
 i have never had a flu shot i did get influenza b about  years ago dr asked if i had shot said it was running  for infection withwithout shot also said staff didn't take shots just used tamiflu
 how do you suppose key workers would get to work without the tube? difference between work and pleasure you say cheltenham wasnut a risk but remind me why then did you dose up on tamiflu before you went?
 yep like in the past we all used tamiflu on our patients without a significant mortality benefit
 imo people are excited because there is nothing doctors like less than a serious diagnosis without a drug or a procedure to treat it borderline effective is not much in terms of patient outcomes but it reduces provider awkwardness by gt; look at tamiflu or tpa
 ex tamiflu treats symptoms if given early but flu vaccine cuts down on flu cases iuve had septic shock wflu amp; will get the flu shot from my immunologist ordered special without preservatives amp; eggs intubated in icu w organs failing is something i do not want to repeat
 i miraculously get better without tamiflu udeudduduufe0f
 so fast forward to that thursday and i fly back to atlanta early to see my doctor i get to the doctor's office and i can't even keep water down without vomiting so they test me for flu and prescribe me to tamiflu and some pain meds for the soreness
 we can have our life back without a vaccine with a treatment you can also move to texas or florida and have it back today swine flu pandemic rolled through with no vaccine because we had tamiflu an effective treatment
 are you okay? i had a severe flu in january and never felt sicker i was convinced i had covid but it responded to tamiflu and tylenol which makes me think i didn't but no way to know for sure without testing
 soon we hope we will have therapeutics that can halt early infection  or shorten the disease like tamiflu but without tests available in every doctor's office early symptoms are differential guesswork with a  hr window is this a cold the flu or c?
 interesting i didnut realize that the flu had no treatment options and asymptomatic carriers? i guess tamiflu is bunk and yearly vaccinations of the flu donut mean shit guess what the carnage would be without those? maybe you can enlighten me what the  deaths for flu?
 i think whatus missing from this conversation is that reopening the economy is tricky because there are no proven treatments as a stopgap until a vaccine think of tamiflu for the flu reopening without something like that is a medically and ethically difficult discussion
 oh i actually hate taking any pharmaceutical unnatural medications itus always been an instinct of mine haha udeudda after taking tamiflu and motrin for the flu a patient gave me; my lips swelled up doing just fine without ibuprofen x decades use ice packs for muscle strains uddudcaaudcudffb
 yes i contracted it boy worst flu ever  i did get tamiflu in time still sick for  days luckily i lived in a home where i could quarantine time from my family i did this without even knowing
 the medical community talks about the flu amp; tells people to get vaccinated every yearnnalso relenza amp; tamiflu treat the flu amp; they may be given to prevent it in people who were exposed but are without symptomsnncovid has killed at least 000 in  months amp; there is no treatment
  exclusive this  report came from cdc researchers who knew how to stop the  spanish flu pandemic without the use of tamiflu or remdesivar which act on the same molecular mechanisms of constraint 
 they made a vaccine u fucking idiot the flu would be killing much more than covid every year without the vaccine they also made something called tamiflu holy shit you people are stupid
 informed consent is a quaint notion to the medical profession a nurse put something in my drinking water we damn near came to blows as she denied it then confessed and gave me tamiflu without my knowledge
 i also feel i had it around the same time i had  days of severe flu symptoms and then coughed my head off for  days thereafter my lungs were so sore i could only lay flat without being in pain tamiflu did not stop the cough only fever which was days old when i started it
 do you find niaidfauci's study without coi? and with impressive results? nntni am ok if it's a real result and if it's confirmed by other studiestrialsni just do not want remdisivir to be another tamiflu scamn
 thanks dr borio for a knowledgeable assessment it is indeed frustrating to see results without methods but this is the clearest account i've seen it does raise the question of whether remdesivir might also be like tamiflu if given early  need to know that too 
 again tamiflu works best as a ppx but so rapidly became the only option for treatment of severe flu it rapidly became gold standard rx for severe flu without rct or high quality evidence decades in there is still controversy over its efficacy
 note that change due to bias towards positive results can also happen without knowledge of the data i literally see that in the explanation modeling to see where a positive would happen with no concern about relevance  a tamiflu like drug won't help anyway
 so much press without full data set being released (unless i missed it) seems like just a really good pr stunt nobody wants this to work more than er docs but before i go loading up the gazillion covid patients i see every shift iud like to know if itus just another tamiflu
 last year in the us  000 people died of the flu and complications we had a ucvaccine and tamifluud last year no one said boo  without a vaccine or acute treatment corona is less deadly 
 it also generated a paper from what might have otherwise been discarded datapoints (patients without 'flu) in a tamifluflu trial   it's useful data insofar as it guides what not to bother with
 thatus so far and as more and more antibody testing comes in the number gets smaller and smaller this is literally influenza without tamiflu or vaccines
 that's an indefinite answer in  in spite of the existence of tamiflu and vaccines some 000 people died in the us nthere are no vaccines for any other corona virus so that's not something to bank on nnyou're talking about people without symptoms masking up though
 never occurred to me broke leg last year in hosp they said you now have pneumonia then decided it was flu they gave me tamiflu without my knowledge went off rails after being in urge to move legs and walk was massive wonder god knows
 go ahead when did we ever suggest ya'll shouldn't get very very closely together in an enclosed environment without masks?nnby all means enjoy tamiflu uddudcdudcudffb
 surely people would have learned from the tamiflu debacle (dangers of publishing without accessing the raw data  aggregate data provided by a third party)
 a  reduction in cancer without major toxicity would be considered major breakthrough we know that hcq isn't panacea but preponderance of current evidence suggests efficacy short of a miracle cure  analogous to tamiflu against flu a perfect shouldn't be enemy of good
  it doesnut work when taken late or without the other  components which is what the other studies did you donut take tamiflu  weeks into influenza; it doesnut work hcq zpac amp;zinc works when taken early and together
 tamiflu is useless without rapid test immediately after exposure just like hcq
 except that it is much more effective than tamiflu plus it has almost no side effect so that people with high risk can even be treated without awaiting the test results nplease look up or for exact info
 sound like the old story of tamiflu nthat canut abuse of the american people like that vaccination without testing and years of observation and check for secondary effects is like killing them with a gun pfizerreally? itus not about money money uddudcb0 gates i mean trump?
 you had to get rid of that mountain of tamiflu somewherenni predict the virus will magically disappear on the th of november with or without a vaccine
 what would the numbers look like without tamiflu?nnsadly i can see covid kill  students in a month easily
 ) the flu has treatments and vaccines covid doesn't if it weren't for things like tamiflu and the flushots that most people take a lot of people like my mom who's immunocompromised wouldn't be able to leave their homes during normal years without risking their lives
 pretty sure there are reports of things like tamiflu exacerbating symptoms a lot of people got worse in the early months because we were treating it with flu medicines i wouldnut just take stuff without consulting a doctor
 nonot approved as a preventative treatmentone doesn't get tamiflu to prevent flu it is used to decrease symptomsthat is how hcq was to be usedwhich is why it wasn't accessible to be used as you are describing  so how did trump get it without symptoms or  test
 hcq is not a useful treatmentall trials have been abandonedand there isn't enough of the other one to go aroundnnthe flu is deadly yes and would be even more so without the  vax rate and availability of tamiflu but since we do have those we have sharply less risk
 with our current knowledge if you are severely symptomatic this is true but we still donut know if that result is a short term result yrs out it might be different  without tamiflu you might die of the flu take hcq zinc vit d zpak early you will be fine

 i'm still livid about donald rumsfeld  george schultz owning big pieces of gilead  years ago  they made a killing on tamiflu  all this stuff is corrupt as can be always has been will remain so without any independent gov't oversight gop is crushing cfpb for a reason
 yes and how many went without tamiflu because they no longer test for influenza a or b?
 not the first time with a virus see the tamiflu campaign many agencies approved tamiflu without ever vetting the data even after cochrane established it does nothing still sold billions of n
 sir imagine we relied heavily in our residency on tamiflu for prophylaxis during swine flu icu duty in  without much other protections
 this food looks so spicy uddude0buddudduddude0buddudduddude0d the poor flu must down without tamiflu uddude0
 thatus the whole point why are people able to take it for years without issue but suddenly  days of it is dangerous?  because itus not we donut wait a week to treat influenza with tamiflu why would we wait a week or more to treat covid? 
 so i assume you mean flu prior to vaccines and tamiflu? last time we achieved herd immunity for a deadly disease without those tools we lost millions of lives  mill in 
 how the hell would tamiflu which has to be used within the first  hours be justified without a rapid flu test? nnthe last few times my kids have been sick it takes about  minutes for the rapid and  hours for the lab send offnn days my imaginary balls
 i get the flu shot every year without fail i still caught the flu one year but luckily it wasnut as bad as it woulduve been otherwise and i was given tamiflu pretty quickly as well i am super scared about falling sick now
 i had a nephew test positive he never got sick or had symptoms i personally believe that if you have gotten the flu or a cold in the past and you let it take it's course without any medical intervention  your body adapts z pak and tamiflu weakens your immune system
 as with remdesivir tamiflu at best reduced the duration of illness without impacting mortality as with remdesivir tamiflu was very expensive and was stockpiled by the governmentud 
 imagine the flu without tamiflu moron
 i assumed no such thing but there must be billions to be made  and ium not keen on safety checks being missed in the rushntamiflu is an oral antiviral very different whocdcema recommended it without vetting the primary data read storyn
 great idea  and need a hcqzinc arm without the tamiflu so it can show hcq zinc is superior
 i remember that novel influenza without a vaccinennoh wait there was a vaccine (multivalent influenza vaccine) nnand an approved developed therapy (tamiflu)
 we didn't stop making flu vaccines with the advent of tamiflu the reason is that the appearance of benefit was down to it only being used on people without cardiac issues any benefit disappeared in rcts it doesn't work for covid and it's needed by others
 i usually get it  for a flu shot at the pharmacy is a lot cheaper than going to a doctor without insurance to get a prescription for tamiflu and then having to pay out of pocket for the tamiflu at the pharmacy
 in regards to hcq yes the studies they used are flawed that's why i dont trust them hcq has shown to work if used early(not late)and with zinc not without zinc the studies they use purposely test late and at times wthout zinc there is a reason tamiflu works early not late
 a leftist didnut send secret police into protests to carry out arrests of people without advising them of what their charges were iud sit right the hell down on this one tamiflu
 the covid death rate without a vaccine is lower than flu with a vaccine and having treatments like tamiflu
 who cares? lots of developing countries (actually lots of countries period) do things without rigorous scientific evidence behind them the us spent billions stockpiling tamiflu once even though rcts show that it doesn't accomplish very much
 the most logical study is without question very early (tamiflu like) with higher risk patient group where benefit could be detected  imo your study proved it could be done safetlytolerably  somehow we do everything we can to inhibit progress is insane and deeply sad
 dr karl do you prescibe tamiflu even without the test then if symptoms and season match up?
 you know if you get the flu there is a drug that knocks it out instantly on the market called tamiflu nnoh and i've went  years without a flue shot and have never gotten the flu
 we do many people reported ucthe worst flu of a lifetimeud unrelenting couldnt breathe never went away didnt respond to tamiflu late novjan  may have had covid we will never know without mass antibody testing
 thatus why despite a pretty good response to the swine flu in  over 000 people still died most were elderly under  or living in a rural area without adequate access to things like tamiflu
 exactly unless you catch symptoms really early and want to try tamiflu no one goes in for the flu and college students without testing no one would go in either heck when i was in college the student clinic wouldn't see me bc i wasn't an established patient cont
 word i got the flu when i was an m and felt like absolute trash for  weeks and that was with the shotuso i had some protection alreadyuand tamiflu i canut even imagine how ill iud have been without it
 rushing through a vaccine with ltd transparency and without undertaking robust clinical trials will be detrimental the race to be the 'first' to create 'the' vaccine is a major concern  prime example oseltamivir (tamiflu) 
 tamiflu or the hn vaccine?  i think that itus all very rushed it is concerning that the vaccine can be brought to market so quickly and have been properly tested for safe administration without future side effects i donut think that i will get the vaccine not initially

 drs give tamiflu for prophylaxis for flu exposure without doing a flu test because there is no point they are asymptomatic and are expected to test flu negative to test pos for flu you are also symptomatic yet all these people are testing covid pos without symptoms? i call bs
  here's my february  column on how smeared a grieving colorado family without ever interviewing them amp; incited mass hatred amp; death threats against them because she didn't like the facebook group that the mom posted ongt;nn
 i get it every year it does create antibodies two years ago i still got the flu but it was milder than it would have been without the vaccine and the antiviral tamiflu was also given to me so i barely suffered at all
 and who do we have to thank for this discovery? who spent years tracking this down chasing down roche like a bloodhound at great personal effort? tom jefferson without jefferson amp; nordic cochrane we would likely all think tamiflu works (most people still do)
 why is that exactly?  nnelaborate please with some discussion of virology and why exactly it is comparable  nnespecially when this is a different novel virus also without a vaccine and specific treatment modality (tamiflu)
 tamiflu cuts it short couples with the flu shot but it's your choice and it's your life the flu shot has spared me from horrible flues for years now i would never go without it
 politics asidewithout fdaapproved antiviral drugs such as tamiflu or relenza the death toll from the flu could be as high as covid experts should do the math first before making a conclusion don't you think? spy spx djia dia electionsnn
 even u canut be thick enough to think this is a good tweet tamiflu ur orange god is covid  because he hosted a super spreader at the rose garden without masks or following any health and safety guidelines is it required to be this stupid to support trump or is natural for u?
 which is amazing iuve never had any success with tamiflu personally but for those it does help iuve heard itus great but for most viral infections we donut have meds like tamiflu weure just kinda up the creek without a paddle once weure infected on the medicine front
 no test or testing regimen can replace mask wearing physical distancing hand washing and contact tracing i vote we save our testing capacity for folks with high pretest probability of detection (compare with most flu seasons when we give tamiflu for ili without a flu test)
 i agree with you covid mortality rate is low most people recover without any medical attention as there arenut any rx routinely prescribed like influenza some people are dispensed tamiflu with influenza presidentus medical care is overly precautionary (the best care possible)

 thinking back to the fact that i went into rite aid with the flu (to pick up tamiflu) in late january without a mask just because i wasnut coughing so that was socially acceptable is wild
 a cont also surprised by increase of tamiflu youud think less because youud not expect for those who tested neg without immediate results youud think more would be rxud because of suspicion and the short window to get it started if itus going to be effective tweetnlearn
 you can see prices without insurance by using the search bar up top however they're not competitive on the drugs i checked for example goodrx has generic tamiflu for  while amazon has marked it up to  for regular customers and  (i think) for prime 
 how many times have you been treated for some bacterial or viral related and needed a formal laboratory test? the obvious exception being the flu because tamiflu has to be administered within  hours and strep throat which can have severe heart complications without antibiotics
 if there was a tamiflu equivalent for covid that a positive test got you access to then sure get tested but without that what's the point? if you feel like shit stay home but if not proceed as normal the faster people quit submitting to tests the faster this goes away
 vaccine discussion at  mins ium worried we will burnout our workforce without any demonstrable reduction in mortality all seems a bit tamiflu to me 
 come down with the flu? here's how much tamiflu costs with and without insurance 
 i hope it becomes the norm here how many people stop at walmart after a positive flu test for their tamiflu at the pharmacy chicken noodle soup and orange juice in the grocery all without a mask? and it's just normal here and totally socially acceptable no more
 my daughter and i had it got tamiflu and it was a one day event (although a really bad day) canut compare it to this without a comparable therapeutic
 and sending them a drug that doesnut even work nis it legal for an insurer to dispense a prescription medication without a physician order? the order to take the tamiflu only comes after the telehealth visit
 i need someone to tell me what he's talking about re tamiflu and ssris i'm scared of google these days i can't even find best chinese restaurants in my area anymore without stumbling on a conspiracy site

 sure tamiflu was a waste but the ppe stores (if kept up to date) would have been useful for covid its not as if the flu plan made covid worse i cannot get a johnson supporter to explain what they mean so i guess its a message they've accepted without thought
 magically no flu or cold in the past year at all no  tamiflu prescriptions and no hospital beds needed for those patients this year also only  of counted covid deaths are actually from covid without other contributing conditions  factorsso maybe wake up to the bs were
  another bug which caused the fever he was given tamiflu and zpack by his primary dr and recovered in  days but doctor would not give him a note without a second test to check for covid me and my husband didn't get sick i told my son stay in yr room and don't come out
 flu down  tamiflu sales zilch common cold is a coronavirus mrna is no bueno other countries successful without vaccine the left defy their own mandates and laws which tells everyone everything they need to know about this pandemic
 another interesting fact the sale of tamiflu the number one treatment for the flu has had nearly zero sales this year according to multiple pharmacists every case that might be covid is considered covid without further investigation covid tests have lots of false positives
 it's important to do it right back in the early s fda who ema health canada all approved tamiflu without seeing the data it's amazingly still selling billions a year
 or it could be the flu is a seasonal disorder and the flu vaccine actually covers influenza this year maybeu just maybe nncould also be that you can give tamiflu for presumptive influenza without testing so we don't use up covid test suppliesnn or it's a conspiracy
 i took tamiflu for hn and i don't want to know what it would have been like without it nnidk why people still think the flu is something dismissive
 you shouldnut have to there are medicines like remdesivir that work for covid just like tamiflu for the flu ium not going to get a vaccine that i can be allergic too i canut even take nyquil without side effects i refuse to take this
 what exactly do you mean by knowingly? when you have flu you went pharmacy pickup tamiflu without mask? sit wait in dr waiting room? that is bs saying knowingly

 i had swine flu amp; the tamiflu put out under similar circumstances without being verified made it worse there is no side effect it's an effect which was to make my skin crawl itch and freak me out about bedbugs no fun with a fever so they can experiment on themselves
 and about tamiflu they gave me that stuff in the hospital without telling me when i was there for a completely other issue i got a swollen face until i started to question the treatment
