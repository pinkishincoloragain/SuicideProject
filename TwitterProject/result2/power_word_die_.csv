 iuve been going to the doctor uddudcudcudffduduufe0f getting allergy shots and that high as zyrtec and something told me to google home remedies and boom
 oh that's horrible and i'm complaining about  days i've been on a steady diet of zyrtec tylenol sinus and allergy eye drops sometimes i would throw some ibuprofen in there for throat pain
 alright i'm serious how the fuck did every single one of my ancestors not die from having allergies? you're telling me some chimp from  years ago had no damn problem running from lions and shit with this in his nose for months and no zyrtec around? i call shit
 i wonder if it's any good it's the same active ingredient as zyrtec
 i got hit with allergies so hard today that i pray for death but i know i will not diefor leaving me to suffer in this weakened form is a worse punishment than anything the devil can do to me also zyrtec is bullshit
 if i donut take some zyrtec i think i might die udeuddc

 why the freak is zyrtec so expensive _ iud rather just die than pay nearly 
 here is the official word from zyrtec i'm glad they made a statement but it isn't good enough companies must label better amp; list all allergens whether it's fda required or not those trace ingredients of soy coconut etc could kill someone with foodallergies zyrtecdobetter 
 my dad bought these dog vitamins to try to help with her allergies and i looked through the ingredients and sure'nuf nettle msm quercetin vitamin c etc same stuff i take along w benadryl amp; zyrtec
 okay? and the fda recognizes coconut as a tree nut people have allergies to soy and tree nuts so they should be properly labeled also maybe the customer care reps should be more educated on the ingredients or at least the allergens just a thought 
 attention people with tree nut or soy allergies nzyrtec includes tree nut and soy ingredients please be careful 
 zyrtecu00ae liquid gels don't contain ingredients derived from tree nuts it does contain ingredients derived from soy oil and may contain ingredients from coconut oil used during the manufacturing process and aren't listed as inactive ingredients on the fdaapproved label
 allergies taking real soldiers out lol try using something everyday like zyrtec
 zyrtec contains unlabeled peanut and soy ingredients 
 from what i can tell the gel caps contain the ingredient but there could be issues with processing on the same equipment so i really have no idea how far it reaches because personally i reacted to the pill not the gel cap
 the additional screenshots on that post show the page for the zyrtec liquid gel caps and the ingredients listednnthis does not include a warning about tree nuts and that could kill someone
 thank you for sharing this my son has a peanut allergy and we check ingredients closely this absolutely needs to be labeled properlynnmyself and  sons have a soy allergy as well but not as serious as the peanut allergy
 i honestly had no idea either my mom shared this with me this morning and i had to spread the word my sister is good about looking into ingredients like that but still this is such negligence on part we shouldnut have to do that work smh
 i had a diet coke and a zyrtec for breakfast
 agreed which is why itus all the more important as an mcas patient myselx allergy warnings are crucial because one wrong step is the difference between life and death ium not taking meds with peanut ingredients iull find a different one they have to put that info out there
 but even this site does not list sources of the core ingredients  so soy nut etc is not indicated for a mcas patient like me it's a lot of trial and error and suffering through reactions to meds trying to find one that does more good than harm mcas
 a lot of people don't know that for prescription and otc med in the us this site will give you full ingredient lists you can check for allergens (cornstarch lactose in so many things) and crosscheck brands to find what you can tolerate  
 allergy sufferers the difference between xyzal and zyrtec is plain to see on first dose xyzal is just as effective as zyrtec in a pill nearly half the size nnapplies to first dose only based on chamber studies and tablet volume

 cetirizine (the active ingredient of zyrtec) has been found to be more potent than fexofenodine (allegra) and loratidine (claritin) may be slightly sedating in some people but in most that's usually not the case

 i feel so sorry for you i looked up medicines available in the uk and i don't see any of the ones i would recommend in the us i use xyzal (levocetirizine) and i would die without it idk how you live like that
 i didnut take zyrtec for a week and forgot to spray my noise all weekend needless to sayi bout died uddude saharandust isthatwhatskillingme allergies 
 zyrtec is the only one that works for me itus a different active ingredient than claritin
 if i take claritin i can breathe pretty well but i itch if i take allegra i donut itch but my asthma kicks up ium allergic to an ingredient in almost all the other allergy meds and zyrtec is a really good sleeping pill if i want  hrs this wedding situation is a tough one
 i would die without zyrtec
 no cetirizin the active ingredient in zyrtec isn't usually bad for you if you take too many nni used to have to take handfuls of antihistamines for my hayfeaver that with loratadine until docs prescribed me fexofenidine instead
 if i took a zyrtec and then forgot i took a zyrtec and took _another_ zyrtec am i going to die from taking too much zyrtec? nnasking for a friend
 we bring him to the vet we've tried almost everything antibiotics antifungals monoclonal antibodies janus kinase inhibitors zyrtec now i am seeking out a canine dermatologist but can't get an appointment until september someone please stop me end 
 fuck okay i took one antihistamine (telfast) in the morning and i took another (zyrtec) a couple hours ago am i going to die???
 my current meds are zyrtec allegra pepcid (h blocker) singulair oral ketotifen also taking quercetin and leuteolin which can stabilize mast cells clonidine for the dysautonomia potassium (rx) and iron because i can't get enough from my diet
 als je niet ongeruster bent dan dat kan je eventueel wat antihistamine nemen van iemand die er neemt tegen allergische neusloop (zyrtec ceterizine bijv) om allergische reactie wat te milderenn
 i would like to see the top chefs create a meal that is better than diet coke and () zyrtec
 and zantac is basically off the market eveywhere pepcid hard to find as well just a fair warning lolnnzyrtec claritin allegra all possible otc h blockers for hives some of react to excipients filler ingredient so it might require trying different formulations to fine one
 take a look for yourself at children's zyrtec syrup scroll down to inactive ingredients and lo and behold nn 
 don't forget other ingredients in antihistamines can also elicit systemic rashes including propylene glycol which is found in children's liquid zyrtec propylene glycol is also in many topical steroids we prescribe like augmented betamethasone
 i feel so horrible my thrust hurts so bad i feel like ium gonna die this zyrtec or benadryl not doing shit
 instead of steroids these days the hospitals are prescribing an allergy med (zyrtec claritin etc) and pepcid takes care of h and h receptors it does dry you out and will take a couple days it doesnut hurt or scar like some other remedies
 i need this zyrtec before i die 
 i literally woke up  thinking i was gon die i took a zyrtec and now my dumb ass is fine
 tinnitus is a thing i got mine from iraq i am too deaf and it gets worse with time  i also play piano and listen to music  i was able to use music to keep my phonetics and singing going i use a couple of home remedies zyrtec and vicks vapor rub

 what is the difference between allegra claritin zyrtec and benadryl besides the active ingredient? do i have to try them all to see what works best?
 i took a zyrtecd and felt like i was about to die lmao never again
 claritind works best for me handes allergies amp; sinuses zyrtecd amp; allegrad is good too all of them are basically the same just different combinations of the same ingredientsit just depends on how ur body chemistry works
 right there with you i'd die if it weren't for xyzal lol
 gi gave me bentyl for the abdominal cramps which i had to take b bfast and dinner it made me really loopy and out of it so i stopped taking it and adjusted my diet i was taking claritin for years until a coworker suggested xyzal and my allergies are much more under control
 years ago i randomly developed hay fever of some description grass didnut bother me but some kind of pollen did regular shopbought antihistamines didnut do anything but doc prescribed xyzal ingredients seemed to be no different from others but it really worked
 i find it amazing that in  the fda suddenly deemed ranitidine as cancercausing and took it off the market nnas far as mast cell stabilizers go isn't good old fashioned asa a mast cell stabilizer? nnwhat about quercetin in the diet or as a supplement? nnclaritin vs zyrtec?
 so everyone else is supposed to live in sterile bunkers and let pollinators we need just die because some are allergic? take a zyrtec
 is zyrtec safe to take after radiesse injection?  fb
 i take zyrtec and it doesn't make me drowsy nhere's a link to some home remedies n going to start getting the shots here soon
 oh yes so everyone reacts differently but claritinus active ingredient is typically less strong then zyrtec usually the dosage is day but docs will let you take up to  some people get sleepy with it it used to make me jittery
 this may be one of the studies under discussion? it's actually about a combined treatment of h amp; h inhibitors zyrtec amp; pepsid togetherni guess the idea is that it helps suppress the cytokine stormnseems unlikelyn
 i donut think anyone is suggesting that an iv medication replace po  in fact  there are numerous studies also showing that po zyrtec is likely better than po benadryl  the purpose is for the er to use iv zyrtec instead of benadryl for allergic reactions
 a customer today told me that i was too young to worry about covid because i would just get sick and wouldnut diennbitch i dont wanna get sick either nnif i did iud just stop taking my zyrtec wtf

 pollen isnut funny i have to take zyrtec daily at night benadryl or i have asthma attacks bad my grandad died from asthma back in the us before meds and inhaler were invented
 no worries i've been on prescription allergy medicine since i was  years old this stuff has worked better than anything i've ever tried  it's basically super zyrtec it's a similar active ingredient but they made it better the generic name is levocetirizine
 i'm excited to share some cool news from livful on the covid treatment front our chief scientific officer dr tom dooley has been involved in some groundbreaking work to treat covid wtwo simple over the counter generic drugs (the active ingredients in pepcid and zyrtec) 
 ok medical twitter can i take benadryl and zyrtec within a few hours of each other and not die
 from my research allergies can be beat with diet  itus not an overnight fix tho best of luck e i still take zyrtec occasionally
 on facebook someone thought that the ingredient in zyrtec was the same thing and then went on to say hydrochloric acid was also the same thing but in liquid form 
 nah i got tested after the zyrtec and all my other allergy remedies didnut irk how they normally do 
 a friend sent me a screenshot of someone she knows on facebook arguing that hydrochloric acid can be used to fight covid she also thinks it's the active ingredient in zyrtec it's because they both have hcl in their chemical formulas

 hmm might be worth trying out an allergy med like zyrtec just to see i was a sneeze monster as a kid until we figured out oh hey maybe you're allergic to trees like your brothernnbodies are such fragile pieces of shit being corporeal is the worst

 someone was just like the flu kills more people every year than coronavirus has yeah and i get my flu shot and take tamiflu if i get the flu too there aren't vaccines or antivirals for this shit and we're in peak flu season too i don't want to die from any of them?

 we donut know whether they work and even if they do donut expect wonders from it do you think the flu patients that iuve seen die in the icu died because we didnut give them enough tamiflu? (remdesivir reduced ebola mortality by about  and thatus what it was developed for)

 bc so many people have died from the flu just imagine the deaths from covid which is x more virulent than the common flu esp bc thereus no vaccine no medication like tamiflu amp; it isnut going away as the weather gets warmer ask the people in the so hemisphere even fl
 of course you wouldnut because you donut care about the old people around you that could catch it and die there is a flu shot and there is tamiflu to help with the flu there is a test to let us know it is the flu cv  has no test no vaccine and no cure
 ich hab noch tamiflu restbestu00ende jetzt scheint mir ein guter zeitpunkt die mal bei ebay kleinanzeigen zu inserieren

 we also have vaccines and tamiflu anti viral medication and over  years of studies about the flu covid is new and the unknown is what people fear but your russian buddies walking away from opec effect our trading as well so donut leave that out
 that many people died with a vaccine and tamiflu medication so how many deaths will you have on your hands without either one you piece of shit?
 perhaps if some of those people that passed from the flu had stayed home and took care of themselves less people would have been infected less would have died also  i believe tamiflu can treat influenza as of yettheres no treatment for coronavirus lordy moses

 also the yr old had also had a flu vaccine and was treated with tamiflu shortly after diagnosis even with immediate medical treatment there was no saving her i almost died from the flu the same year was in hospital over wks and  days of that was in icu
 tamiflu does not uckillud influenza data that states it works is based on low quality observational studies it has not been shown to reduce influenza mortality rates
 it will continue to spread and hopefully will die down during summer and by then meron ng anti viral na fda approved and may vaccine na rin the anti viral i heard might be  per pill compared to tamiflu for influenza at  per pill
 it should cost at least half of what tamiflu costs because you're way more likely to die of influenza than coronavirus but thanks for feeding the frenzy how presidential
 there are vaccines for the common flu thatus why more ppl donut die there is a common test amp; there  are treatments (tamiflu) to shorten the duration none of this exists with coronavirus
 there has never been any solid indisputable proof that any of these antiviral drugs have any real impact on viral deaths  the government and the public spent billions on tamiflu for example and there are several studies showing it's of no use

 a yearold in colorado died from flu this week days before his mom reached out to facebook's biggest antivaxx group members told her not to take the tamiflu a doctor had prescribed but give him oils and elderberries and put potatoes in his socks

 herr prof sie wissen oder vielleicht auf grund einer bildungslu00fccke dass der coronatest extrem ungenau ist?nbis zu  falsche ergebnisse machen die sache nicht gerade leicht ich sage auch nur tamiflu soviel zu unser fachpersonal
 and that many people die from the flu with proper vaccines and tamiflu available no vaccine  no meds for coronavirus means a lot more people have a chance of getting it which can mean a huge number of deaths one death from coronavirus is one too many
 we need more than the lord for the government to wake up and do something about this health crisis where is tamiflu or similar to prevent people from dieing??? wake up
 why arent they treating people with tamiflu or something that helps fight the virus if you have a test that detects the actual covid then how the hell arent you going to have something to ease the symptoms instead of allowing americans to die 
 also we have decades of research on flu plus vaccine amp; treatment (tamiflu) all of this amp; people still die from flu not time to panic (yet) but blowing covid off is so dangerous
 disgusts me beyond beliefnnon facebook antivaxxers urged a mom not to give her son tamiflu he later died  via 
 big difference is that for the seasonal flu you have vaccines plus tamiflu for treatment; so even if you get a bad infection it leaves you in recovery fairly quickly this is a sars virus with no vaccine or treatmentplus if you are elderly or immune you are more likely to die

 it's a shame that they don't quantify those numbers were they elderly or immunocompromised? did they die of pneumonia? did they have the vaccine? did they receive tamiflu?
 i can tell you that studies show elderberry is as effective an antiviral against flu as tamiflu  but this virus is so new no studies have been done to prove anything effective

 ucin animal studies remdesivir has seemed to work against sarslike viruses its effectiveness will probably hinge on getting it early enough in the same way that tamiflu is most effective against the flu when given early in the course of infection n
 the hope is antiviral drugs early in the disease course may keep the disease from progressing this far just like if you take tamiflu when you first get the flu you donut get as sick  why it is important to develop ability to test quickly and do studies to find the best drug
 itus x more deadly than the flu nnk people died from the flu with a  mortality rate means m of our population got it with flu shots to interrupt transmission and tamiflu to stop it in its tracks nnwe have nothing to stop this from spreading wash ur damn hands

 you have some antibodies to flu even if not exact match also we have tamiflu and vaccine having someone die from the flu especially healthy people makes local news flu mortality of  times lower
 shikimic acid is found in star anise; dill and other plants; shikimic acid is the priority ingredient in tamiflu;

 star anise  through a highly secretive process roche labs use large amounts of common asian star anise to obtain shikimic acid one of the principle active ingredients in tamiflu which could be used for other illnesses like covid
 those studies were not good donut antivirals like tamiflu need to be taken early in order to work? i am not going to discount it being an option and the fish cleaning death incident is a little murky but yes i agree trump has to stop talking science

 hey bro covid being a virus like ebola flu or hiv needs an arv drug that can suppress the viral load to allow bodies to develop antibodies for hn there was tamiflu; for ebola there regeneron amp; mab which has had success japan reports covid success with avigan

 does anyone starting tamiflu when they severely sick with pneumonia? hcq is an antiviral right? disappointing that studies are so mismanaged pts need antivirals early or not at all drs will say it doesn't work and the average person can't get it because of this
 it has been suggested that these unpromising chinese studied might not exclude remdesivir as a possible early treatment perhaps there is an early window where it could be usefulnntamiflu works this way if you don't take it soon enough it doesn't work
 ich verstehe die ganze diskussion nicht jeder weiu00df doch inzwischen dass viren stu00endig mutieren was soll jetzt eine impfpflicht gg sarscov oder covid wenn dieses virus sich bereits wieder veru00endert hat wenn d impfstoff bereit steht? ich sage nur tamiflu  schweinegrippe
 it does work this study only used hydroxychloroquin on the deathly sick in the last stages (it works best when given early kind of like tamiflu) and works best when given with zinc they didnut give zinc with it studies treating early and with zinc are showing promising result
 antivirals are tricky  just think about the use of tamiflu a proven treatment for the flu  must start it within  hours then the outcomes are very nebulous  it will take large double blind studies to get any reliable data
 nu00f aber die zu  privatfinanzierte who mu00fchte am liebsten zwangsimpfungen noch tamiflu im ohr?
 really? thatus why 000 people died in one month?? we get less than that in a year with the flu we also have tamiflu and a vaccine for the regular flu uddude
 in the year  doctors treated patients successfully with hydroxychloroquine zinc amp; antivirals like tamiflu or azithromicyn yet skeptical people choose to wait for certified studies that would come after they died how do we tell them the news next yearn
 dann hat herr rumsfeld ein paar von seinen mit tamiflu verdienten dollar wieder verloren 
 that is absolutely normal antivirals should be used early (tamiflu for hn as an example) they won't do any miracles in vitro results for hcq are promising animal studies are promising but the key is to use early

 hey dumb dumb tamiflu doesnut work either of you donut start it within hrs the ucstudiesud didnut control this
 the media is getting off on this pandemic spreading lies about hydroxychloroquine they want people to die claiming it doesn't work because you gave it to near death intubated patients is bs like tamiflu and other anti virals early adminstration is required 
 naja die nebenwirkungen bei er schweinegrippe waren wohl nicht ohne daher haben sich auch relativ wenige impfen lassen und impfstoff musste vernichtet werden wie auch massen an tamiflu wir haben damals die logistikoptimierung fu00fcr roche gemacht uddude
  does that mean it isn't helpful during the early stages of illness much as tamiflu is sometimes beneficial? no one is arguing that it might have that use but at this point in the pandemic this information is not going to be available studies must be done to see this clearly
 die tamiflu story 
 thereus a treatment (tamiflu) amp; an effective vaccine thereus a population with some level of immunity amp; itus a virus thatus far less contagious (fewer people infected by each sick person) than covid each time we compare apples to oranges in this way more people die science
 if antivirals like tamiflu work best when administered as early as possible why are hydroxychloroquine studies using it as a uchail maryud and without zinc? udeudduduufe0f
 they won't give up on itnnthe media will push it down everyone's throats for a few weeks but in weeks or months the studies of prophylactic use will come outnnscience is already familiar with tamiflu type drugs even if the media isn't
 everything iuve read on hcq is it needs to be taken early like tamiflu for influenza (within  hours of showing syptoms) otherwise they say not to take it if itus taken too late like tamiflu it does no good  if hcq is not studied in stage  then itus a ineffective study 
 ucget vaxxed and you prolly wonut die from flu even if you get sick plus there is tamiflu which treats itudnnthis is such a stupid statement that it isnut worth a response
 groc clerks are dying scientists all around the world are working day amp; night on a vaccine likewise many are working on a therapeutic like tamiflu is for influenza so that so many wonut die when they get coronavirus currently  of the people that get it amp; go on vents die
 i got steven johnson syndrome in  from obviously a bad lot  of tamiflu nearly died i've seen and felt your terror my family is trying everything to keep me safe i have lupus got bit by a lone star tick got alpha gal the same year as sjs i'm still recovering
   many interventions have optimal time of use  'tamiflu is used to treat flu symptoms caused by influenza virus in patients who have had symptoms for less than  days'  less than  days   hcq studies to watch are those with like protocol imo

 robert you're a fear mongering asshole the virus was already here this past winter studies are emerging stating that s of thousands of folks have antibodies you know doctors were saying this isn't the flu here have tamiflu anyways
  pneumonia is counted as  flu death  how many died as a result of sepsis or cardiac arrest due to tamiflu or tylenol that still is counted as flu death? how many gold standard (db placebo studies) have been done to measure vax vs unvax children in regards to flu vaccine?

 yes i am baffled by the comparison the flu season typically lasts  months we know itus coming every year weure encouraged to get flu shots and tamiflu works in many cases comparing covid to flu especially at this point when k have died in a month isjust wrong
 gut dass ich mir damals tamiflu mit wirkverstu00erker habe reinpfeifen lassen war eine sinnvolle mau00dfnahme danke herr lu00fcbbers fu00fcr die bestu00etigung
 two more thing i can  most likely there will be no vaccine  as this virus does not create antibodies corona virus don't create koreans found in sample of infected people no antibodies hence no immunity  yes medicine like tamiflu could be helpful

 everyone should get vaccinated certainly but the availability of a vaccine and tamiflu and the learned immunity our bodies have developed against it are the reason it doesn't become a pandemic like covid

 haben die damals bei tamiflu auch u00fcber rumsfelds finanzielle interessen berichtet?
 die staaten verpflichteten sich fabriken zu bauen um den (unwirksamen schu00edlichen nutzlosen) impfstoff tamiflu herzustellen eine medienwelle rollte u00fcber uns um uns angst vor der schweinegrippe zu machen  drosten einer der einheizer
 yeah if they had tamiflu back then definitely would've helped though i was under the impression that most people (especially yo ) died from cytokine overreaction right?

  via read until we have a vaccine or therapeutics (like tamiflu is for influenza) or widespread use of serum antibodies i think this will be our only choice
 you are a fucking idiot nflu 0 mortality ratencovid nnflu antibodies  everybody on the planet has themncovid  nobody has themnnflu  has a vaccine ncovid  no vaccinenntreatment  tamiflu etcncovid  no clinically trialed treatmentsn
 das glaube ich nicht weil die doppelseitige lungenentzu00fcndung selten bei influenza vorkommt auch das sie eben nicht auf tamiflu reagiert was ein influenza medikament ist das hu00ette recht schnell alarm geschlagen das fieber reagiert an sich auch kaum auf fiebersenker 
 this happened during the swine flu outbreak msm ubuy tamiflu we donut have enough tamiflu people will die without tamifluu two years later uwhat you wasted all that money buying tamiflu we didnut needu
 even with a vaccine and tamiflu etc 000 died in the usa of influenza in the usa and tens of thousands on average die every year
 this is an anecdotal account of one urgent care clinic doc (not even er) we need peer reviewed control group studies not even tamiflu works in hrs btw
 nope and itus right from the gop playbook example  donald rumsfeld owned patent to key ingredient in tamiflu also used in flu vaccine not sure whowhat owns it now but remember big push during flu ucpandemicud when he joined bush in office always thought it was suspicious
 it's much easier  catch amp; deadlier it spreads fasterlook at the statistics more people have died per capita from covid there is tamiflu  the flu u can take  shorten the symptoms amp; make them lighter maybe u're just saying this bc ur life hasn't been affected by this yet
 ja ku00fnnte der wirkstoff von tamiflu (ich habe als auu00dfendienstmitarbeiter von roche austria tamiflu seinerzeit bei den niedergelassen u00crzten eingefu00fchrt) bei covid wirken?
 which was treatable with tamiflu and zpack yes it freaking sucked yes i had it it ran rampant on my college campus but 000 died in one year with plenty of supplies and medical personnel we are almost at k (i give it a day) and no ppe no vents no meds not the same
 this may be more a testament to the billionaires' whisper network which was previously optimistic about kaletra and tamiflu based on tiny messy studies or anecdata
 star anise is also a good resource one of the most popular pharmacologically relevant attributes of star anise is its shikimic acid contentnshikimic acid is a compound with strong antiviral capabilities  in fact the main ingredient for tamiflu (used for influenza)
 the speed at which certain vaccines are pumped out is a concern there was a news story about japanese ppl (mostly teenagers) who killed themselves when they took tamiflu (ie oseltamivir) how some of these poor kids died though was borderline horrific 
 as a physician who has treated children with severe influenza if i donut start tamiflu upon admission and the child dies iull be sued have you been in that situation?
 as i remember for hn they didnut shut everything down because we had tamiflu so it wasnut that big of a deal even though people died from itthereus no cure for corona atm so we really could be in the house for  yearsudeuddudeudd

 he was trying to enrich his buddies  nncheney andor rumsfeld owned many shares in companies aiming to profit from pandemics through selling products such as tamiflunnsee and theshockdoctrine
  died from swine flu in us and tamiflu worked on swine flu we had a treatment from day  we are already at  and we don't have a treatment nn hate obama more than you love the truth
 i feel like people are just cherry picking the studies showing possible improvement but ignoring the negative ones is this treatment the next tamiflu?

 well iull tell you this i think tamiflu is most trash when it comes to treating the flu studies show it shortens the flu by maybe  hours?nnhydroxychloroquine could work u better than tamiflu relatively u but as fauci keeps saying its success is largely anecdotal ()
 note the title of article ucsevere infectionud an antiviral tamiflu only works w flu if given within first  hours itus possible antimlarial drugs have similar timing different studies r needed trying this combo to people at different stages of infection
 they work better than vaccines they work better than antivirals like tamiflu as well amp; they are only given when someone needs them because they are sick you donut treat healthy people we arenut god we donut mess with our bodies unless we are sick
 even with a vaccine tamiflu etc 000 still died is there a source that confirms all who died did not have the seasonal vaccine? if memory serves seasonal flu vaccines do not make one immune rather it may reduce the severity
 you may in fact be correct but no way to know until it is properly studied the hcq failures we are seeing could be that it was started too late just like tamiflu loses its effectiveness if given too late
 spread died down in summer  tamiflu became a useful option for treatment  the  flu vaccine afforded protection for hn and was utilized throughout the us  overall  died which was below origiinal expectations
 the flu excuse makes me so angry i don't think you die fast n aggressive w the flu i have no choice w covid no vaccination no tamiflu no easy access to hospital no test  nothing i hope the same people who said to my face  wks ago it's the flu have realized it's not

 i was definitely flipped out in  i was due to visit  families in san diego in midapril  the week before i was to head there each family had someone die of flu  cancelled my trip  ordered doses of tamiflu from england
 ppl die every year from flu we have flu vaccines the deaths are preventable we have antivirals tamiflu nnif you are insured flu vaccine is free why is that? public health advantages of herd immunity help everyonennthis doesn't have antivirals vaccines are still a ways off
 the options for more moderate to severe cases seem to be toclizumab leronlimab convalescent sera targeted antibodies ?remdesevir or other antivirals i think the focus should be on treating it early with antivirals or hydroxychloroquine? ala tamiflu
 there's some legitimate (but small) studies that indicate hydroxychloroquine could have an impact but only as a shortening effect if taken early (similar to tamiflu) possibly useful as a future treatment in mild cases but it won't stop the pandemic
 i find nothing that says that a lot of articles conflate all penicillin family drugs with penicillin itself the few china supplies ingredient for articles i've found were just one drug  tamiflu  but no antibiotics mentioned
  studies show antivirals are most effective if administered as postexposure prophylaxis or within first  hrs of symptoms (eg tamiflu zanamivir peramivir zinc rimantadine amantadine)hcq in the treatment of covid is no different early treatment is key

 normal thinking people do not believe this is a cure you don't cure a virus you treat it if there's a treatment available or your body fights it or it doesn't and you die this according to many doctors has had positive results as a treatment like tamiflu with the flu 
 tamiflu has been shown in studies to be ineffective against covid  may be treating concomitant influenza only
 the flue has a vaccine the flue kills  (covid is much higher) the flu  covid will collapse hospital systems the flu is actually less virulent nweuve studies flu strains for decades flu has low incubation we have tamiflu (treatment) this isnut like the flu itus worse
 ium not convinced of the broad usefulness of antivirals they reduce duration and severity illness in infected people but you still get infected itus like tamiflu people still get the flu and sometimes still die
 had a really horrendous flu it wasnut long after tamiflu came out but no flu since so no vaccines  who knows the antibodies it left me with?
 yes  and the rate of transmission is a reflection of lack of immunity lack of vaccine in population in flu even suboptimal vaccination rates disrupt many chains of infection much better studied virus  therefore other agents eg tamiflu also available to lessen flu impact
 more contagious amp; no treatment just fighting it out on your own or you canut then you need a ventilator hopefully you come off that amp; recovernflu has treatments like tamiflu amp; vaccines to lessen spread us die from the flu this could be us of thousands if weure lucky
 die frage ist wer das braucht erinnert sei an das tamiflu desaster
 people that develop chronic illnesses due to diet aren't contagious and they are making a personal choice to poison their bodynwe have vaccines for the average flu patient and tamiflu and xofluza to treat it
 exactly he did nothing and 000 people died in us from it and in fairness that was the flu and there was a vaccine and therapeutics like tamiflu as well as testing all in place on day  and we still had 000 deaths with obama
 i'm not saying that isn't true  i'm just saying currently we only have case studies to try and heal someone with the disease  if you get the flu you're going straight to tamiflu and it will kill it within hrs  we don't have anything like that yet besides quin
 its like a sweet licorice tea; highly recommended (same ingredient as the fdaapproved tamiflu antiviral med)
 what we are most likely to find with both hcq and remdesivir studies to be published soon is that patient outcomes are materially improved if administered promptly upon diagnosisnnthe clinical data will support that they are like tamiflu in this regard

 isnut this what happened with the last two pandemics? meaning we never developed a vaccine everyone either died or developed immunity people have a faith in this vaccine yet tamiflu is in high demand every single year
 treating viruses early is key this has been shown in studies on the benefits of zinc for the common cold tamiflu for hn and other antivirals where treatment makes a significant difference when started within the first  days of symptom onset

 hydroxychloroquine and the french studies are based on antiviral and prevention hcq is a zinc ionophor it pulls zinc into the cell and makes viral replication more difficult  once your very sick and virus has fully replicated itus of minimal or no value same as tamiflu

 does it work out well for people who are healthy? maybe so but itus just like tamiflu in my opinion if you use it and feel better you claim it was the medicine but in all reality it was your bodies immune system and proper hydration and viral symptom treatment
 perhaps but the studies so far indicate hcq used early has a significant  impact for years we have noticed azith made a noticeable impact on influenza cases but we still use the tamiflu early as well
 excellent example tamiflu has been shown in carefully controlled studies to have a beneficial effectnnin the same kind of controlled studies hcq has been shown to not have any beneficial effectnnthat's how science works

 all the late term studies when cytokine storm had set in showed hcq was not effective  only studies showing good results are those studies when hcq was taken early like you would if it was tamiflu
 also the studies in this country have been done on late stage patients tamiflu is given for the flu but must be taken early to have any effectiveness perhaps hydroxychloroquine needs to be tested on early stage patients before we throw the baby out w the bathwater

 there were very decent studies out of france it is similar to tamiflu when you take tamiflu for the flu it must be taken early and it absolutely works if you take tamiflu too late it does nothing same thing for hydroxychloroquine taken early it works
 the other reason is the comsumption of staranise; the active ingredient in tamiflu;

 yet received email from again today reminding i should not use hcq except in hospitalized pts or in trials no you got that totally wrong hcq is for early disease like tamiflu amp; valtrex ur cited studies were designed to fail hcq

 and what treatments do we have for the flu? tamiflu? really? so why do all these people die every year despite a vaccine and residual immunity from other previous influenza viruses? there is no cure it hits the weak (mostly elderly and unfortunately way more children)
 yes the nyu langone study is the most recent as with any antiviral (eg tamiflu) it has to be given early onset of disease studies show the addition of zinc improves patient outcomes by  many other studies media gives no attention to if youure willing to look
 those 'studies' were flawed to begin with nnthey are the equivalent of giving tamiflu to fluturnedpneumonia patients

 yes i saw some cases this year where a few young healthy people died from flu because it got into their blood stream best is to take tamiflu early
 sadly the claims were never properly tested the claim was that hydroxychloroquine  zinc would be preventive early in the infection (like tamiflu is for the flu) the studies left out zinc and gave too late therefore did not test the claim

 thus itus critical to develop several treatments (ie tamiflu equivalents) amp; pray our bodies develop strong immunity through inevitable exposure but hopefully small viral loads as quantity impacts gravity of illness thus masks amp; distancing will remain important unfortunately
 i don't want to even get involved but i can't help myself  i mean besides a vaccine for the flu proven treatments like tamiflu etc and the fact that most of us have been exposed to the flu and probably have some antibodies nnhere is your numbers for this flu season  
 evaluating a potential antiviral weeks after symptom onset makes little sense the invitro studies suggest hcq has a chance to work similar to tamiflu if you take it at symptom onset it lessens the course of the disease we have yet to evaluate it in that capacity
 did any of these studies attempt early use? other antivirals (like tamiflu) only effective in first  hours
 i very vaguely remember it the st cases showed up around the time my mom died (cancer) amp; i effectively lost mos so it was this white noise on the periphery i remember making pigflu jokes amp; the semiscandel when it came out chenney owned a huge stake in the tamiflu producers
 ginko biloboa has tamiflulike ingredients; avail health food stores; capsules; powder or gingko tea; (like staranise);
 many godgiven plants are available to make medicines for covid; few are being studied; tamiflu is a natural element; tamiflu is shikimic acid; found in natural plants worldwide
 gingko biloba has the same ingredient as tamiflu the antiviral; shikimic acid; 
 japan and vietnam seem to have herd immunity even before any antibodies are produced high vitamin d levels in japan not sure about vietnam but there too maybe and they eat star anise (what tamiflu was made from) with seems to work even on sarscov

 so why are they claiming there will be vaccine when there are still flu deaths? cant say that all those who died arent vaccinated? they should concentrate on making pills like tamiflu but i guess its not economically viable

 good call one nursing home had  cases used hydroxy treatment  survived washington state governor banned it most all died antitrump politics killed thousands nationwide can we just go with what works not what makes the most money i bet tamiflu is as good as remdesivir
 i was thinking genetics when it started but i am leaning towards diet tamiflu or oseltamivir came from star anise which is used when making biryani maybe they should look in that direction as well
 yeah i assume ucwe will never knowud is based on tamiflu which started with a bevy of lowquality studies (many pushed by the drug maker) its ineffectiveness wasnut revealed until after the drug was in wide circulation and confusion remains over its use 
 tamiflu active ingredient is oseltamivir phosphate

 und zur erinnerung wir haben diese diskussion bei tamiflu schonmal gefu00fchrt
 tamiflu essentially does the same thing for influenza so it's a singlenhowever tamiflu also can be used for post exposure prophylaxis so if and it's a big if remdesivir also does that (waiting on those studies) then it's a double right now it's just a single
 genau und der chemie liegt die physik zugrunde  genug  haarspalterei?nnnicht um beziehungen? wie war das mit tamiflu von roche und rumsfeld? sehr transparent
 isn't emdesivir is the same as oseltamivir  the active ingredient in tamiflu?
 the manufacturers and insurance make money off of the yearly flu shots in turn people weaken their immune system and sometimes die also consider that tamiflu was in the news recently for killing a teenager trying to combat the flu the rabbit hole is deep with this one
 letus put it this way you mentioned the flu and i worked with the tamiflu team for about five years so i understand viruses whenus the last time in your life time weuve had almost 000 people die in two months in this country from a virus? itus not influenza
 i don't take any medications and never would   i personally think more people die from taking tamiflu rather than from the flu itself   the side effects from any medication just don't make it worth it to me  same for a vaccine

 das mit der schweinegrippe hab ich damals auch total blockiert der mann einer freundin flog extra in die usa weil hier keim tamiflu mehr vorru00etig war uddude ich hab mich noch lustig gemacht und gesagt wegen der normalen grippe? hu00ette nie gedacht wie das wieder aufkommt
 this is a different virus tamiflu don't work on some strains of flu this is shown in multiple proper studies to not work with c
 if youuve ever been prescribed tamiflu and understood how that helps curb the flu symptoms if the virus is caught early itus easy to conceive how cloroquine zinc and zithromax can help keep covid patients alive while their bodies combat the virus we are the cure
 tamiflu is also effective later  it's just better earliernnthere's no evidence that hcq is that effective early or late  it's just not that effective  people had hopes for it but the controlled studies have not shown it to be that much more effective than a placebo
 yes a  nih study of the drug and the first instance of sarscov proved the drug an effective prevention and treatment if given at the first sign of illness much like tamiflu and influenza current studies were skewed by waiting too long
 it works but you have to give it early when the person first gets sick like tamiflu it inhibits viral replication in the body nnsome of the ustudiesu that were done waited until people were dying on ventilators to administer hcq which is worthless they were designed to fail
 if science has provided a vaccine and treatment (tamiflu etc) for the flu then why do people still die from the flu?
 tamiflu is used within  hours of being symptomatic not exposure and has a much better safety profile the earliest  symptomatic covid presents is at least  days post exposure  tamiflu has also shown efficacy in well controlled trials not just subanalysisretrospective studies
 we have a treatment for many of the dieases that are preventable by vaccination just like anything else in medicine in order to have the best patient outcomes we need both for example we have an annual flu vaccine for prevention and we have tamiflu for the treatment
 they are trying much more than hcq you know real doctors in er and icuus are rotating patients keeping them from ventilators hell giving them tamiflu and antibiotics doing hard work not just relying on that drug all these studies and not one work in the field
 agreed  itus important to understand study flaws  the studies showing hqc benefits have similar flaws  small sample size subject selection randomization of controls  one issue your site brings up is how soon hqc is administered  important for tamiflu and other antivirals
 you know as well as i do that we've had decades and several hundreds of studies done to tease out the correct timing and the efficacy of tamiflu there's not a lot of relevance to this discussion
 and donut get me started in the studies that said it didnut work when they didnut give it to the patient until very late in the illness cycle that would be like trying to give tamiflu to somebody who is already on deathus door with influenza
 yes theyuve have known since  about treatment for sars cov  uccovidud is sars cov  if you have a flu strain you take tamiflu if you have a sars cov strain wouldnut it make sense to take chloroquine nobody had to die 
 we donut deny the flu we have vaccines for flu we even have tested amp; tried treatment for flu (ie tamiflu) so if someone dies itus also a tragedy; but itus not due to our president amp; his blind followers spreading misinformation and spreading worsening the spread of the virus
  it doesnut work when taken late or without the other  components which is what the other studies did you donut take tamiflu  weeks into influenza; it doesnut work hcq zpac amp;zinc works when taken early and together
 here is a compilation of studies note that those that indicate that it doesnut work often donut use all  components or start late in the disease we donut treat flu with tamiflu  weeks in because it doesnut work then 
 most studies have been after the patients are in the hospital that say the drug doesn't work these doctors have stressed that the drug when started when symptoms appear works if you take tamiflu  hours of symptoms it works otherwise it doesn't
 sehe das problem mit der pharmalobby auch bin aber trotzdem wirklich sehr froh u00fcber viele zahlreiche wirkungsvolle und sinnvolle medikamente die tu00eglich vielen menschen helfen und da meine ich nicht tamiflu
 no i got a horrid flu not long after tamiflu came out at 00 on a sunday  monday could barely breathe to call dr  never another flu until almost died last year from covid symptoms
 wow similar to hcq studies interestingnnis tamiflu safe to take for someone with long qt syndrome?
 many of the studies waited until it had progressed to the point that they knew hcq doesnut work used too high of a dose or didnut use zpac and zinc alongside you donut wait  weeks to take tamiflu for the flu why wait to treat covid?  
 again i never get to the point where i need tamiflu my remedies work for me and my partner whous an emergency room physician
 dr fauci you are a lying dog face pony soldier it works like tamiflu if taken early onset symptoms amp; as a prevention prophylactic 
 a corona virus is covid covid  is a corona virus hence the flu comparison fyi tamiflu has sooo many more side effects than allergic reaction if hcq is sooooo ineffective and harmful fake studies wouldnut need to be cited or published
 i've read the studies and it's rather clear it works but needs to be taken early (similar to other antivirals like tamiflu) the media has been terrible and they haven't looked at all at how other countries are using it and their outcomes
 the two studies from lancet and nejm were retracted but henry ford study showed a significant decrease in death just as you donut wait two weeks with influenza to take tamiflu hcq works best earlier 
 it is sad no one will give them an adequate platform to get thier info out people have died that didn't need to die because they weren't given an effective drug it has to be started in the first three days similar to tamiflu the drug is safe and available otc in most places
 that'ss why md's are demanding access to it outpatient upon diagnosis no different than tamiflu which only works within the first few days  i'll believe top epidemiologists and infectious disease experts like dr stephen smith who advocate for it over twitter nobodies
 sure have more studies perhaps it will be useful earlier in the course of the disease among covid positive (that's kind of the middle group not yet tested; perhaps it works sort of like tamiflu) but don't put all the eggs in one basketwe know most drugs don't pan out
 those studies have been recalled and they address that hydroxy cannot be given in the hospital where the studies were done  itus too late by then itus used as a preventative like tamiflu  listen to the broadcast
 its like a cult with you people did you get a brochure you had to memorize? flu has a partially effective vaccine and therapies including tamiflu and studies out now show that due to covid protections including masks are showing much lower flu ratesn
 tamiflu isnut over the counter many die from the flu and there are very affective treatments for covid
 tell that to freddie freeman or eduardo rodriguez or the tons of young people with lasting organ damage after recoveringnflu has flu shot to reduce the symptoms and tamiflu to help fight its virus and take care of it within a few daysncovid has absolutely nothing
 youure lnot was king at one study and it specifically says severe given late itus like tamiflu has to be given early look at the study from marseilles and the harris hospital which did numerous studies the drug cocktail all  together worked you canut separate them
 thatus so similar to how youure suddenly so concerned about the flu we were treating people in tents in  teachers died because they couldnut afford tamiflu  times as many children die every year there are horrible longterm complications where is your flu advocacy?
 ) herd immunity  the flu has been around long enough that most people have some sort of antibodies keeping them safen) vaccines   effective is better than 0 effectiven) tamiflu  a treatment to help aid in recovery from the flunnthere those are the differences
 i told you that hcq should be used early as outpatient amp; meta analysis of available studies shows hcq is effective in early trtmnt or preventionnnhcq works much like how tamiflu works win st  hrs of flu after  hrs w flu tamiflu not as effective
 i had a father concerned about giving his daughter tamiflu ndad i saw that people can die from thisnme sir people die from the flu if they happened to take tamiflu and then die it is reported as a potential side effect ndadnmendad okay
 nope then it spreads and spreads everyone gets zpak medrol tamiflu and tessalon people die at home
 we had  die of influenza b in a  week period in a nursing home i worked in a couple of years ago we did the full ppe the tamiflu m
 ob jemals eine wirksame impfung kommen wird oder ein wirksames medikament (tamiflu bei grippe kaum bis gar nicht wirksam) ist ohnehin fraglich aber gerade deshalb brauchen wir nichtmedikamentu00fse mau00dfnahmen wovon eine allgemeinere maskenpflicht die einfachste amp; effektivste ist 
 is tamiflu being studied as a covid treatment ?
 they found that treatments such as tamiflu used to treat seasonal flu were effective coronaviruses are not as well studied as influenza and much more difficult to treat
 rumsfeld war von  bis zu seinem eintritt in die bushadm im jahr  vorsitzender von gilead erinnerst dich noch an tamiflu und die vogelgrippe panik?ngilead hu00elt dort ebenfalls die rechtewas das hepatitis medikament betrifft hat gilead erst vor kurzem ein generika erlaubt
 that's because it has to be combined with zincnstudies sighted using it late are irrelevant tamiflu doesn't even work unless it's used early and no one discredits that mednstudies using more than requirednand studies using only hcq nlook at studies that combine hcq and zinc
 ok sweetness let ne break this down as a mom of  who has been a mom for more than a quarter centuryn there has been decades of studies research and clinical trials on the flun theres a vaccinentheres tamiflunwe have no idea what will happen with covid
 because  of adults had antibodies and it was children who were susceptible  my kids both caught it at school and so did most of their classmates they stopped testing for it and just have tamiflu assuming they had it nnthey also weren't counting deaths with it as from it
 and yet thousands still die even with a vaccine because the vaccines donut treat every strain of flu that comes  the vaccine doesnut completely protect people from the flu there is tamiflu to treat the flu but again thousands die every single year of it
 because most people donut die from the flu we have vaccinations for the flu and we have therapeutics like tamiflu
 so between rapid testing flu shots and antivirals like tamiflu we've got the flu far more covered and yet people still die this really isn't hard but you're choosing to make it

 dude i had hn it sucked i felt like i was dying but i didn't have to be hooked up to a ventilator and there was a treatment tamiflu  plus i was fine in a couple of weeks and i didn't sustain longterm damage i didn't dieni'd say a lot has changed you idiot
 flu like symptoms? almost k people have died in  months i guess they should have given them a zpac or tamiflu instead of the ventilators right dr bombay
 no it doesn't very few take a vaccine there is also tamiflunnyou seem to think as long as people don't die from covid they are finennnothing could be further from the truth
 elderberry syrup or tincture(alcohol based) star anise tincture(the main ingredient in tamiflu) virus busters knocked out my daughters(positive tested) flu over night symptoms gone
 try even getting flu b per not covered per vaccine getting pretty ill as my family last dec  er and got tamiflu see world wide last year how many died per the flu?  children get the flu
 suggestion ) get a flu vaccine in   of the people who died from the flu were not among the  million who were ) diagnostics are readily available and if someone is positive a prescription of tamiflu shortens the disease
 you can be treated for the flu thereus a vaccine for the flu over the counter remedies i got the flu and was given a prescription of tamiflu
 roughly  of population get a flu shot  we also have treatments such as tamiflu to lessen severity  yet millions get the flu and 000 die each year  so why are we obsessed with covid? unrealistic to think just because we get a vaccine covid will go away  time to move on
 also the fact that it was not given right away upon onset of symptoms is troubling other studies have concluded that this is important think about tamiflu  if not given win a short amount of time itus effectiveness is lessened
 i agree man this thing is making the rounds what worries scientist is that there isnut a tamifluvaccine type treatment for this the people who studied for years to understand things like this are in some cases scrambling that is the problem some donut get and just

 philosophically the discussion below is one talking about the tamiflu of covid  if you get it early enough you likely don't go into the icu  within the us up until the henry ford healthcare system study studies were trying to cure covid with tamiflu for covid

 time it should be indefinite until we have the virus gone or a vaccine is made that actually can motivate our antibodies to stay longer than a few months or something like tamiflu turns up that works against the virus i get you are bored with dealinggt;

 die pandemie wurde erfunden um mit dir unwissenden und deiner angst grou00dfe geschu00efte machen zu ku00fnnen tamiflu war nur wegen regiefehlern ein gigantischer flop schon vergessen?
 the  independent controlled studies you reference did not include zinc with the hcq and started when the patients were already hospitalized for hcqzinc to be effective it needs to be started at diagnosis like tamiflun
 was passieren kann zu schnell und ohne langzeitstudie zeigt die schweinegrippe (tamiflu pandemie )  diese arte doku ist absolut sehenswert allein schon deshalb weil drosten und wordarg zu wort kommenund wer recht behalten hat eine knappe stunde

 there are large early use studies and trials that show significant patient improvement from all over the  world fda studies are in hospital patients  big difference think tamiflu and how it works
 die haltbarkeit der millionen einheiten tamiflu endet doch bald damit werden viele grou00dfe lagerhu00euser frei
 your numbers are skewed because we donut screen everyone for any reason for flu unless they have flu like symptoms and if someone dies of a heart attack itus not due to flu whereas it would be labeled as covid and still deaths w vaccine and tamiflu so go f urself
 so i have a maga nurse sister of childhood friend who thinks covid is no worse than flu and flu shot is  effective also that hydroxycholoroquine (sp?) is effective treatment that has been politicized negative and is more studied than tamiflu give me some comebacks please
 i think that it's time to actually do a solid study why move on?  you just threw out links to  flawed studies where only one had z pak included and it was in hospitalized patients (worthless to take hcq at that point similar to tamiflu)
 when my doctor told me i had hn in  he sent me home with tamiflu he made me aware that the studies were inconclusive at that time for effectiveness on hn i still took it maybe it shortened the duration of the illness or maybe it was a placebo hcq is today's tamiflu
 i donut see where i said it hasnut been tested i have said that we need far more studies to prove itus efficacy if there is any and i would prefer those studies be designed based on tamiflu protocols where can i read the publication for the studies your system has performed?
 yeah except many of the studies focused on patients already on ventilators many of the studies did not monitor zinc or use azithromycin thereus nothing more useless than a poorly designed study if i followed the study protocols they used for hcq i could prove tamiflu useless
 exactly i think the trial should have been redesignedu as with treatments for influenza like tamiflu the recommendation and best outcomes happen when it is administered within  hours of infection instead they completely stop the studies altogether
 echte studien kamen von wem nochmal? wer war die pfeife wegen dem wir tamiflu erst fu00fcr millionen anschafften und dann fu00fcr millionen vernichteten und wodarg hatte schon damals rechtninteressant ist die verbindung von beraterexperten und herstellern der tests
 and if you do get the flu there is tamiflunnappalling that you would endorse the covid is just the flu canardnnand as you no doubt know those who get the vaccine do not get serious illnesses and diennor suffer protracted heart lung brain effects
 and by the wayhave you observed that the studies cited always seem to be missing zinc in their protocols? additionallythey are providing the protocol to inpatientsthe key is to get this early like tamiflu

 sure here's the word studies reveal it doesn't reduce hospitalization and there's no evidence in a reduction in complications and those who are healthy the benefits of tamiflu don't outweigh the risks and here's a screenshot of the source nice try though 
 depends on how soon after nnlike the flu tamiflu  they donut recommend tamiflu it could worsen symptoms nnin the first days absolutely studies also show some people can raft better within  daysnnhydroxycholoroquine   tamiflu 
 because they're doubling down several studies have come out that shows that that drug works very well if you get it in the system early like tamiflu but if you don't then it's useless but because trump said it could work they want to make sure you think it doesn't

 there's a lot of parts to the treatment of flu in particular and i'll try to take it apart so it makes sensenfirst tamiflu the evidence for it having a meaningful benefit is slim studies show small benefits in length of illness and maybe severity with caveats 
 regularly this year i got the flu even though i had the shot and it was bad because i couldnut get tamiflu right away but still ium getting the flu shot i got tested for antibodies it wasnut covid
 i never got the flu vaccine until i had the flu  yrs ago i had over  degree temp amp; almost died i have taken the flu vaccine ever since amp; only one time did i get it since then amp; it was mild i got tamiflu within  hr of knowing i was ill amp; i was fine i always get it now
 in regards to hcq yes the studies they used are flawed that's why i dont trust them hcq has shown to work if used early(not late)and with zinc not without zinc the studies they use purposely test late and at times wthout zinc there is a reason tamiflu works early not late
 iuve had it for years now amp; will get it from now on the reason? i got the flu years ago amp; it was the most horrible illness i have ever had amp; almost died i was young healthyamp; nearly died thankfully tamiflu was around amp; shortened my illness to a week trustscience
 not lying to people despite vaccines and tamiflu we have 000000 die globally ever year from influenza go do your research before calling me a liar
 the first death occurred  after the public health emergency was declared   people died before vaccines got approved and vaccinations began () before the vaccine people were being actively treated with tamiflu my company produced it day and night for months
 alles wegen einer pseudopandemie (die ehrenwerte who hatte  die kriterien geu00endert  um den verkauf von tamiflu zu fu00frdern)

 that is correct  flu has no cure we have meds that reduce its course (eg tamiflu) and if the annual vaccine is good our vaccinal antibodies provide additional defense what many people donut understand is the difference between contagiousness and virulence
 iuve read many studies the studies that show hcq to be ineffective used patients that were already seriously ill with covid were of advanced age  such as the va study etc the key is starting treatment asap much like tamiflu is effective against flu when taken win  days
 none of the randomized studies have been early or includes zinc everyone knows you have to take tamiflu early to work hcq is the same
 tamiflu only works in beginning stages same with hcl notice no one is doing studies on people in early infectionnearly treatment does have success and why would you not want to use it early on b u need hospitalization
 leslie has no idea what she is talking about with hqx  continues to parrot studies for very sick cover patients and one study that was a survey and not science at all  she ignored what molly and other hopeful studies conclude for early therapy (similar to tamiflu) 
 letus not forget the texas teacher that died from the flu in  because she balked at the ridiculous cost of tamiflu and the lack of coverage from our insurance nwe canut afford to get sick we donut have the same insurance as our politicians we should itus shameful
 not sure you understand comorbiditycause of death designationsbut why would you? covid has higher fatality then flu no vaccine and no treatment (eg tamiflu) he probably did die of pneumonia caused by cv as well as heart failure etc sure everyone dies your point?
 imagine  yrs ago if we did the same for hn let's say we gave name to pneumonia disease from hn as bigbird0nnanyone who died with flu would be a bigbird0 deathnnthe conversation would be tamiflu does not cure bigbird0nnhowever we know tamiflu does help with the flu
 is hydroxychloroquine like tamiflu only effective in early stages of either virus?ni don't see fauci asking for studies in early intervention with the drugnif we have volunteers for vaccine trials why cant we have volunteers to test effectiveness of the drug as preventative
 sounds exactly like the flu tamiflu treatment  you need to take tamiflu within  days of symptoms  all these bad studies are after people are extremely sick media is ignoring studies when hqx uses at onset of symptomsnnhave to wonder why the media and democrats ignore this
 and ium betting no one died so people got sick w a respiratory virus and did fine welcome to life influenza way way worse as it kills many people even with a vaccine and tamiflu
 hcq studies didnut accompany with zinc and look at usage for early treatment  most studies were done after disease took over the health late in the sickness  anti viral treatments like tamiflu for flu virus are mostly effective very early in the infection  hcq early

 uctamiflu does not do what roche promised roche hid this fact for many yrs by selectively citing its studies amp; suppressing data abt tamiflu they utilized lobbyists key opinion leaders amp; ghostwriters to promote tamiflu w a deceptive promise to govs fearful of a flu pandemic 
 i was hospitalized and almost died from hn because a dr missed the diagnosis and made it to late for tamiflu to work spent  days in bed avoiding that would make me ok with a vaccine
 perhaps because the mortality rate was  00 to  00? or because tamiflu is an effective (albeit far from a silver bullet) treatment for hn? or because  of persons  and older had antibodies for hn? and we have learned from the mistakes of our response to hn
 until covid is no more dangerous than the common cold and has a medication for it as common as tamiflu i will not be going to a theater if the audience still has to wear a mask for  hours in a movie theater then itus not safe itus definitely not a movie going experience
 since roche can not manufacture enough tamiflu the biggest real threat is that older people particularly w a propensity to pneumonia will succumb to influenza ab amp; have no antiviral as with previous years millions more worldwide will dien gilead

 unlike covid hospitals weren't reimbursed k for each hn death so they didn't count deaths with the virus as from the virusnnalso most adults had some kevel of antibodies to it already which allowed them to fight it better and tamiflu was already a treatment
 my kids had asthma and required tamiflu albuterol breathing treatments and prednisone to survive hn  of their classmates were aick also it affected children more because most adults had antibodies for itnnyour ignorant gif doesn't impress me taffy
 i donut know anyone who died from the flu plus thereus tamiflu and a flu shot donut know where you get the  survival rate data from
 i caught it bad between vomiting from the tamiflu and the fever from the hn i could've died if a friend hadn't come to check on me
 yes people got infected with hn yes people suffered complications and died but not nearly at the rate that people are dying of covid we also had an antiviral treatment in tamiflu which helped people recover we don't have an fda approved drug for covid 
 this isnut an antiviral remdesivir is itull never be tamiflu for covid because in lt; year when people can be vaccinated that will be cheaper and confer the same (or greater) benefit and these antibodies will be obsolete
 i have known over  people who died as a result of tamiflu i wouldnut prescribe it to my worst enemy 
 i was apparently too far gone for tamiflu? ni'm in the exam room the doc walks in and says so what should we do?ni'm like uh you're the doctor herenhe's says well it's not pneumonia  you'll be ok in a week if your temp hits  come in or you'll dienthat'll be  
 tamiflu landshark here is hilarious dear leader actually has the 'rona and they are still trying to shame people out of wearing masks one of the surefire ways to fight it i guess to more people die? the must be so u0u0eu0u0u0bu0 
 hey tamiflu how about thisnget up off your knees stand tall in front of your orange dicktator and take a deep breath in from himnwe'll circle back with you in a week or so to see how it goesnidiots trumpcovid trumpisanationaldisgrace trumpliedkdied
 also we have the therapeutic tamiflu and more people die of the flu
 per cdc last year 000 people died; thats x the amount of people who have died on your call you have had access to a medication regeneron that only few have had access to flu has proven treatment that works unlike corona tamiflu widely available yet some cant afford it
 some cancers are a better corollary is to say remember how many people died before penicillin was created or remember how many people died before the xray machine was created or remember how many people died before tamiflu was created
 they also agreed herd immunity is close sweden already back to normalnprotectvaccinate high risk the rest either has or will have partial immunity almost  of k who died from flu (despite vaccinetamiflu) were children nothing shut down last yrn
 which is a problem  all of the studies have pointed to early intervention  even the flu is not as bad when people get tamiflu right away  so it would make sense with other viruses
 yea but they havenut they say more people die from the flu every year so why not experiment with other therapies other than tamiflu because it has really bad side effects? ium inquisitive 
 korrekt  kein impfstoff tamiflu ist ein pru00esentes beispiel das bei big pharma starke interessen vertreten werden die nicht immer wissenschaftlich fundiert sind und der staat sich auch noch dafu00fcr einspannen lu00esst

 since ium apparently not allowed to speak my mind elsewhere despite the political hupla hydroxywhatever actually does help if you take it like tamiflu with zinc early on several studies have backed that up the big one everyone knows about they snuffed a bunch of patients
 i disagree remdesevir has not been shown to be harmful in mild illness many reasons to believe it plasma antibodies most effective early just like tamiflu it was studied in those who are sicker is because of resource utilization and opportunity to prove nlt;0 he is potus
 these aholes have access to treatments you amp; i don't when i had it in early march amp; almost died the best my dr had was tamiflu even though i tested negative for the fluif barr gets it he'll get the royal treatment if you or i get it we'll be lucky to get hcqudeuddcudeuddcudeuddc
