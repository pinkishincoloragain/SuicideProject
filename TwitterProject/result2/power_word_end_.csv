 of course i am referring to myself and others i'm close to if being on wellbutrin longterm ends up a good thing for me  i'm okay w it at a low dose i don't like pills i'm not a fan of big pharma

 wellbutrin is a godsend but the startup insomnia is a bitch careful not to lapse or you have to endure it again
 i feel a bit like wellbutrin decreases the anxiety dimension of depression for me possibly by making me feel slightly less engaged with the things that bother me on the other hand i think it also tends to reduce some of my engagement with the positive things in my life
 i quit wellbutrin at  years old cold turkey one of the best worst ideas i've ever done glad i survived but i don't recommend going cold turkey on mess without docs advice ucudcudffbuufe0f

 i mean i guess it's better than waiting for a month cuz i do wanna discuss a slightly higher dose of wellbutrin but i do not remember scheduling an appointment i only remember doing it for the end of june which is also in the system
 if you don't think celexa is right for you don't be afraid to try other medications if you're comfortable with that i ended up switching to wellbutrin and it's worked okay (in a good way) for me so far and i've been on it for almost a year healing is all about trialerror

 wellbutrin is a really hard drug to acclimate to i had the same experience same drug switch and ended up having to get a prescription for xanax and reduce the wellbutrin dosage for a bit i'm not saying that that's what you need to do but i do want to reassure you a little
 omg i finally had like a really awesome weekend where i didn't get lonely or depressed at all idk if it's because i've been reaching out to people or bc i started taking wellbutrin or maybe both but i'll take it
 time for a miserable sleep from which i'll be going the weekend unmedicated (i might open an old emergency bottle of wellbutrin tho)
 what medication would that be i have taken wellbutrin for bipolar which i've currently discontinued and never have i insulted people or threatened them yes i agree that certain people become violent off medication depending on their illness let's not paint with a broad brush
 iull be glad to follow you i only have a few people who even give me the time of day cause i say what i mean to say when youure on wellbutrin you tend to say a lot but ium a kind person faced with a lot of loss hi
 it sounds like it is growing on the trigemenial nerve  when they biopsied mine they said it was a non cancerous neurofibromas they tested me for neurofibromatosis but that ended up not being anything  do you happen to take wellbutrin? because i have a crazy theory
 wellbutrin is amazing (at least assuming you don't get the common amp; rather nasty side effects my friend who recommended it to me had to discontinue but it's been wonderful for me uddude0a)
 tried wellbutrin on a friendus advice and it fucked me up in all the wrong ways (reduced sleep  dry mouth  hello surprise sick) nnglad itus helping you though

 since sertraline should be out of my system was told to try wellbutrin next the trial and error period sucks tbh but there have been so many success stories i feel i shouldn't give up just yet if there is any hope to get over this i am at my wits end and ready to give it a shot
 cue dramatic music sudden sunniness aside i was still crashing occasionally in the evenings so my doctor recommended switching from the standardrelease wellbutrin to the extendedrelease oncedaily version i started taking it in march

 yep i get to pay full price for every month of wellbutrin because i'm seeing a doctor not covered by my insurance this also means when my friend an md who will occasionally write me an rx when we get the flu and does not bill me i can't even get those pills covered
 it just goes to show that drug effectiveness is dependent on an individual's biology and specific symptoms more than anything  wellbutrin is more effective in cases of depression that involve excessive sleepiness and lack of motivation stuff like that
 in todayus fun adventures we just had to spend  minutes finding and picking up most of my monthscript of wellbutrin because the cap of the bottle opened in my fucking cage purse and they all fell out in gravel on the side of heights blvd

 this is so important iuve walked this road i knew the hotline i never called it took friends and family pushing me to go to my doctor wellbutrin saved me the grief that comes with ppd is only outmatched by helplessness and guilt suicideawareness

 my name is barbara and the most difficult thing i do every day is get out of bed  i suffer from long term depression and occasional anxiety and i take mg of fluoxetine and mg of wellbutrin daily endthestigma
 i had my depression under control but anxiety started getting to me i felt like my heart was going to explode for several minutes a day everyday thought about suicide daily then i couldn't make sense of clocks and calendars started wellbutrin back to normal
 this sounds like every negative reaction i've heard about from wellbutrin my meds tended to have mr happypants turns into mr softy or mr neverfinish for a while
 moving from pristiq which has helped tremendously from where i was to wellbutrin anyone on that?

 hello wellbutrin my old friend
 my mom ended up taking me to the hospital but she wouldn't leave my side when they were asking me questions so i lied as to not worry her they told me i wasn't in enough danger to be hospitalized so they sent me home with sleeping pills and wellbutrin uddude
 everyone is different wellbutrin has helped me tremendously also exercise i would caution a nonpsychiatrist telling you to get off meds it can make it way worse
 lexapro has been nice so far it's defintiely good for my anxiety which is a fucking godsend; i didnt realize how much worse the anxiety made things it turns out so much of my fuckedupmentalhealthcocktail is anxietydriven which is why i think wellbutrin fucked me up so hard
 if you choose wellbutrin try amp; get name brand generic gave my friend seizures it helped me quit once with the bonus of weight loss
 surely they'd welcome him if he were taking ambien xanax prozac wellbutrin addrerall amp; such rx drug friends  each of these drugs with psychotic suicide side effects black box warnings listed on labels and in the pdr so twisted marchforourlives fixit why invite it?
 there are cases where people fall asleep driving due to celexaus side effects most people stop taking it because it makes them so tired wellbutrin is a good one and i highly recommend it iud say after  weeks if celexa is still making you feel that way talk to your doctor
 please everyone say a prayer that my neighbor who smokes cigarettes in his house will be able to quit smoking send zyban juju his way amen

 i thank you for the legendary lol it is much appreciated on a weekweekend where i am pretty certain my wellbutrin has stopped working
 i really don't think the upped dose of wellbutrin is helping actually might be hurting cuz ive cried from sadness more times since the upped dose than i have all year maybe even in a whole calendar year
 bout to run out of wellbutrin requested more but no clue if theyull send the script to ky cold turkey wellbutrin withdrawal right when grad school starts ought to be fun
 yeah the only other med im on is paxil for depressionanxiety my doc recommended wellbutrin bc it's not a controlled substance and while it's not a stimulant it does help regulate dopamine levels it's mainly prescribed for depression but it has also been known to treat
 at this point i think i can safely say the wellbutrin has helped us tons with our ability to concentrate we can sit down and do work for an extended period of time wo getting distracted or antsynni really like thus is this what its like to not have adhd i like it
 so i took wellbutrin like this time last night and i think i am feeling the end of it's  hour length and ifeel very weird
 now i know why my script was so expensive the shitheads at my doctor's office called in my zoloft instead of my ambien bith my zoloft and wellbutrin have  day scripts so i got   day scripts i have no ambien for the weekend
 question for a friend wellbutrin (or other bupropion ad)   how severe are side effects usually and how long do they persist after starting the drug?
 weight gain was one of the concerns i discussed with him when choosing which med to go with he recommended wellbutrin said he saw much more positive effects in his patients than traditional ssris i'll try and post updates when i can
 iuve been on zoloft forever at higher doses it gave me an endless hungerappetite iuve been taking wellbutrin as well to help with my adhd but ium not sure if itus helping or not
 i hope it all works well for you and as intended there's lotsa good years of use for wellbutrin hugs
 guess who else has since been diagnosed? lol good guess it's my momnnshe started on wellbutrin (at my recommendation) and suddenly has more energy and attention span than she's ever had in her life funny how that works
 reading abt bruxism and wellbutrin and this web article says smoking increases teeth grindingclenching and recommends wellbutrin for smoking cessation uddude 
 the frustration of being depressed so many months on end has me very worn  i have been isolatingmust embrace a spark that brings hope while in this black pit which is my reality waiting for my wellbutrin to work is challenging to restrain from self destructive behaviors 
 well might also be that i infer i accidentally swallowed a wellbutrin today i don't have a scrip for that and never in my life have don't ask how it happened half life tends to about  hrs
 i can't remember all the meds i tried before my doc finally hit on the wellbutrinseroquel combo that changed my life for the better i was on wellbutrin for  years and he threw in the seroquel to help with sleeping about  years after i started wellbutrin my doc  godsendu
 my friend said ium more uctwo dimensionalud since starting wellbutrin a few months ago little does she know i only had one dimension to start with so iull take it as a win
 not having my wellbutrin may uhhhh actually kill me this weekend cvs why did you have to choose now to take fucking forever to fill a script

 i don't recommend taking bupropion (wellbutrin) for depression in that despite being an ndri (norepinephrinedopamine reuptake inhibitor) studies have found it doesn't inhibit dopamine well
 psa for friends taking antidepressants uu iuve been taking wellbutrin for the past month and iuve discovered an rare and unpleasant side effect  debilitating bodymuscle pain
 have you given them the full  weeks? and wellbutrin actually goes up to mg under the brand name forfivo but i wouldnut recommend unless there were no other options
 my psych yesterday wants to switch me to namebrand wellbutrin since she thinks itll work better for me but uuuhhhh theres a chance id have to pay over  a month for it (she gave a coupon that should work but it depends on insurance)
  but the cravings for carbs were always there the high caloric expenditure would make me crave fats usually peanut butter would be enlisted as i was not eating  much or any animal fat so after  dose of wellbutrin it was exercise and food  ehh who cares why bother 
 oh no im sorry ) wellbutrin has been a godsend for me so i hope u get everything all fixed up and it helps soon uufe0f
 oh i forgot about wellbutrin my friends husband used that and it really helped him
 i did that and it helped me for a bit because i liked it so much less than smoking but i ended up starting up again the gum helped me a lot and so did taking wellbutrin which stopped my cravings
 oh has a pharmacology specialization? or just does a lot of meth? or spends a lot of time in kholes? what adhd meds is jace on? like wellbutrin? are people crushing wellbutrin to snort? is that what you do?
 unisomladen thoughts this has been a shit month starting with when i hit the deer or maybe it was when i was born i enjoyed how my parents just solved all my problems back then now i just depend upon whatever book ium reading to absorb the badness also wellbutrin
 fingers crossed they took me off wellbutrin entirely and tried me on a bunch of other things that didn't work at all i was still having hives months later so they let me go back on and it all settled down hoping for a happy ending for you too
 i know that it's difficult i was packday girl for man time i hated smoking amp;that i hid it from my friends amp; coworkers i didn't want anyone to know i did it with the drug wellbutrin it made cigarettes taste bad amp; disgusting i quit in  weeksni had
 surely watching someone stream neverending nightmares at am while taking wellbutrin known for giving you vivid nightmares will be a good idea
 take the meds within a week of me starting wellbutrin it helped my thoughts tremendously i hope your meds help you
 i went two days without taking wellbutrin last week and i have been paying for it ever since sometimes itus okay to admit youure not ready for something to end
 i do take meds but not all adhd people do there's also different types (stimulants are the most talked about that people can be intimidated by but some people take wellbutrin instead) even if you'd rather not take medication i'd still highly recommend seeking the diagnosis
 i take wellbutrin xl (extended release  but i take bupropion xl the generic) it's fine for me i tried lexapro amp; i think zoloft had bad reactions to both they are ssri's wellbutrin isn't which is likely why i'm ok on it i don't get the upper feeling some get though
 i was in therapy for the first  years of my kidus life started xanax after months of insomnia amp; replaying the birth over and over every night for months started wellbutrin a year later still need more physical therapy again it doesnut end when thereus a baby on your chest
 i had an old friend who worked for a huge finance company really super smart together guy started taking zyban amp; within  weeks he was a shambling wreck  stopped looking after himself totally amp; he got really short tempered too  i barely recognised him scary stuff
 i'm definitely a cat person because of how busy i am depending on your schedule patience etc  pick whatever's best for you if you have the time to devote to it
 dogs are more work depends on your lifestyle  dogs are a lot of work but great to have around
 cat dog boyfriend all under the same category and provide as mich company as anyone else but out of the three mentioned the dog is probably the most loyal and brings a lot more satisfaction when it comes to listening and closeness
 as with many things i donut believe there should be a law dictating this as it highly depends on the individual and the situation eg different people may have sufficient support systems and also it is possible for people with mental illness to improve thenselves
 your complete lack of compassion for marginalized people wounded by your words leaves me very concerned for what other outrageous and 'sinful' theories are lurking in that brain of yoursnyou hurt someone you won't admit it and you're defending your hurtful actions bad look 
 and also maybe the reason you think that no one has ever been offended or triggered by your question is that no one has ever told you to your face so think about that for a hot minute
 wouldnut it depend on whether the problem was actually psychological or neurological a person with emotional issues as a result of trauma can come back around a person born heading voices telling him to murder his parents is probably not a good candidate
 it's possible to make the argument that they shouldn't but where would that end? in the pursuit of a perfect society who's next? asthmatics? the hereditarily overweight? probably best not to let that first domino fall

 now that wellbutrin is becoming the norm i still eat and even started getting fiendish ab cigs on it ium mildly buzzin on this sertraline
 would still highly recommend wellbutrin to anyone wanting to quit as i donut experience intense cravings and the detachment makes it appear safe to prognosticate not buying another any time soon
 i had one cig a few months back when i had stopped taking wellbutrin and it really really really messed with my digestion at the time (back to that later) and the cig did nothing to that end because i didnut feel that nicotine buzz i thought it also didnut help digestion at all
 i 'm on wellbutrin uddudeit's not the words its just personal not your fault but what i went through being denied excuse given dea guidelines it's not like regular pain it was cancer returned images wtumors if not for my son's i would of took my life to end the pain thx udcudf

 hello nni was on mg of lexapro my dr said they had the least side affects but they made me gain weight like crazy and i became really depressed now i'm currently on mg of prozac and wellbutrin (not sure of the mg) and they've worked tremendously for me
 ium currently taking the generic form at mg and itus really helped i combine it with generic wellbutrin and iuve felt a lot better and have more energy and motivation the lexapro just causes me to yawn intensely more frequently which tends to cause

 jtus gonna end up passin on that wellbutrin probably he didnut seem too enthused about being given it
 so i feel compelled to share my enduring struggle with us pharmacopia amp; the aspects to which it affects my spiritual amp; physical composure wellbutrin (adjunctive adhd med amp; appetite suppressant) phase out my circadian er rather orionial rhythm amp; metabolic dynamics r readjusting
 ium so glad my doc has talked up wellbutrin over my lamotragine and ium wondering if a switch might help me ium glad to hear such a recommendation

 and she put me on wellbutrin it has been a godsend within a few days i was able to calmly and rationally make a decision about my future  i need tweaks here and there but i know that me not being on medication makes me and the people around me miserable
 for anyone with depression who wants to try medication but doesnut know what to get on i  recommend wellbutrin iuve been on it this whole summer and i feel so much better than i normally do ium actually happy and finding beauty in life
 i ended up just staying on wellbutrin for my adhd instead of being on both the wellbutrin also has an appetite suppressant in it and it works well for me
 make sure you donut have any bipolar tendencies along with your depression; i was put on wellbutrin and it sent me into a hypomanic episode for the duration of the time i took it nnium sure itus a great medication but it doesnut play nicely with bipolar or manic tendencies
 wellbutrin didnut work for me but worked wonders for my mother i recommend giving it a go itus a weight neutral medication that has a good reputation uuaufe0f
 my friend called wellbutrin the happy skinny horny pill i took one this morning and i am none of these things yet  who do i talk about getting a refund?
 at the risk of offering unaskedfor advice  you may want to look into wellbutrin (bupropion) it's an atypical antidepressant that tends to be stimulating and i found it worked pretty well for me for a while
 i take suboxone and wellbutrin it makes me apathetic and irritable as shit but i don't want to get off of it(for the th time)and go through another storm of alcoholism and drug usei probably should stop spending so much time alone but i really can't relate to anyone anymoreudeuddf
 the kicker is that he originally wanted to put me on wellbutrinwhich was on the handout i turned in back in october of previous meds that i've been on and didn't worknnwhy do my psychiatrists keep recommending meds that don't work and keeping me from meds that have worked?

 wellbutrin didn't do much for my mom it hyper accelerated a friend's ocd tho i took three wellbutrin pills once amp; had a terrible trip

 i've used wellbutrin hcl for  years and experienced no side effects at  mg twice a day  helped with quitting smoking too  nortriptyline was terrible for me  unfortunately what works for one may not work for another  recommend trying wellbutrin first

 think i need to hit up the old friend wellbutrin once again haven't missed him at all honestly
 do you know of people with whom it caused adverse issues (ie duloxetine)? i never researched it b going on it the dr recommended it as a replacement for wellbutrin been on it for a few years it's not necessarily easy but it seems to help life slow down and make more sense
 yeah indeed don't wanna build any benzo tolerancedependency but also really sick of the clench and grind citalopram is great tho  that and zyban are my team drugs hurrah
 zyban works   writing a farewell letter to the love of your life that you have kissed 000's of times but that is killing youn drink water (lots of it) she'll end up reenjoying the flow of time and life
 alright everyone ium trying something new tomorrow i got patches and zyban to quit cigs send me good vibes pls
 that would be way too easy wouldnut it? nobodyus perfect anyone who pretends otherwise is a liar
 if it is the latter i get it i used to spend a ton of time fucking with people just because usually in little subtle ways eventually it gets boring though
 ium going to say something for the record after finding out who this was read some of likes and shit i would have been friends with her without hesitation i am sure she is a cool girl but she boldface lied about me other people and i hate liars

 my friend makes wedding gowns so ium having her make me one similar to this 
 iuve actually said that to a friend of mine who was having issues at work itus helps to remember that when something doesnut work itus not failure but they learned how to not do something
 maybe thatus the game go off the deep end and see how people respond
 careful now wouldnut want to offend any ants uddude0 
 yeah that is such a dangerous statementrecommendation to make and only causes further harm and damage to not only the the patient but the loved ones around them trying to be their support system and help them stick with the best course of treatment
 if you want to be offended look up the contrave commercials like ok bitch donut demonize french fries and ice cream bc they have only ever been uddudcf there uddudcf for uddudcf me uddudcf
 you are right i got prescribed contrave by my doctor and its like a pre diabetic metformin and its increased my metabolism tenfold and ive shed  pounds in a month id only recommend it to people who are in crisis and need to lose weight fast
 weight loss medication is preferred only when bmi is higher than   medications available are orlistat belviq saxenda contrave which is  combination of naltrexone and bupropion phentermine qsymia these drugs acting by crubing appetite 
 in the us qsymia belviq and saxenda are also indicated for weight loss the last of which is injected and contrave was approved for the same indication but its manufacturer announced bankcruptcy earlier this year so i am unsure whether it is still available
 i had that before itus not too shabby ium so glad youure off wellbutrin andddd i definitely canut sleep without pot it bothers me when docs save give it up but you wanna give me a sleeping med that iull legit become dependent on? thatus a no from me fam pot is safer
 i would keep the wellbutrin but start looking at more than just xanax exercise for the anxiety i may have to start meditating heaven forfend eek
 nah you made the right call theyure always like ucyou gotta ween yourselfud no hunnie i legit do not feel safe nnwhen i was on it i had sociopathic tendencies and i was like uhhh who is this bitch then when i tried to kill my self bye bye wellbutrin
 wellbutrin fam extended release is the way to go
 always worth a shot and ya there are many different types of meds depending on your mental health unluckily my side effects is staying up too long and lack of sleep so in going to test others i took cipralex and taking wellbutrin now just so you know
 thank you and really you just have to want too i legit felt like i was losing a friend it's weird  i did use wellbutrin for a few weeks  then it was almost llike a challenge for us maybe he couuld try chantix wellbutrin or something like thatwhen he really wants too
 bupropion generic wellbutrinzyban took away cravings and calmed me through  weeks while i tapered off chantix was not recommended because of the suicidal side effects for my husband it was a cancer diagnosis quit right away has lung surgery and hasn't smoked since
 wellbutrin accidentally got me straight edge if you wanna stop using substances of any kind i recommend trying it i havenut even been wanting coffee lately
 also have been having an allergic reaction all weekend to the combination of cipralex amp; wellbutrin in my body so that's fun uddude
 aaaaa hi i'm just wondering if you had to ask for wellbutrin or was it recommended by your provider?? because i've been feeling this exact same way and am nervous to straight up ask for a med switch
 even then it's a struggle finding the right shit i'm  months in of  different medications( and the side effects at the beginning fucking suck if you're talking antis i do not recommend prozac or effexor wellbutrin i started recently
 i wish doctors would recognize the damage they are causing i had a friend who stopped taking wellbutrin and was a mess i was surprised and started looking for a way to help her i was shocked by the horrific stories of withdrawals
  to this for sure everyone is so maddeningly unique zoloft did nothing but make me sweat wellbutrin at mg xr helps with mood swings tremendously wellbutrin at mg xr did the opposite and also made me extraragey at the drop of a hat
 my best friend is basically more depressed because of wellbutrin but he canut come off it suddenly because it could make him worse and heus burned out because of ems and i canut help him and i want to fucking scream
 i got told that my bipolar disorder was me latching on to the idea that its 'cooler' to have something other than depression nnfive minutes before the appt ended the dr asked about anti depressants amp; i mentioned wellbutrin turned me bonkers nnsuddenly im now bipolar 
 whatus sad but also helpful is that we all have a little community built up around the daily regimen we all partake in just to be sane a very quick look just at the bottles told my my old friends lexapro and wellbutrin were around
 wellbutrin works for me except for never ending anxiety  plus i have chronic pain for bone spurs on my spine which nothing really helps  plus my  yr old grandson has an inoperable brain tumor 
 at  i went on bupropion (generic wellbutrin) with a much smaller dose of fluoxetine (mg) and that worked wonders for me my issue is more with dopamine than seratonin i'm now on just bupropion (mg) and loving it but it really does depend on the person ()
 i wish you luck with getting to feeling better i remember that both when i went on prozac amp; when i came off of it i felt like a zombie for about  weeks ended up it wasn't the right med for me amp; there was one that was worse (effexor) but then wellbutrin was the right one
 went to therapy over lunch break today for wellbutrin sunshine water good friends and good therapy i give thanks mentalhealth

 aahhh wellbutrin giving me energy to cope (just a hair better) with my chronic pain and fatigue such a good friend along with lamactil (this is absolutely my exp w antidepressants they don't lessen the pain but they maybe free up a couple mental spoons for dealing w it)
 ) before their crisis now they'd rather have everyone try expensive mindaltering drugs for pain each with its own list of dangerswoes (cymbalta lyrica amitriptyline wellbutrin effexor etc) also not effective for pain friends who went to pain clinics amp; had
 it was the worst my anxiety wasnut as bad until i took it i was given anxiety pills for when i had attacks not like a daily pill and i ended up taking them daily and i think itus because the wellbutrin
 anxiety is the ruler of my life klonopin wellbutrin and some other l word pill i take just donut cut it iuve always been a very independent person almost to a fault and now i freeze up driving forgot what ium doing this is not normal
 after our dad passed away my youngest brother was put on wellbutrin and he absolutely hated how it made him feel but i also have friends who had positive reactions to it i think itus effects work differently depending on your chemical makeup
 yo anyone got some wellbutrin or prozac asking for a friend
 any of my fellow medicated friends take wellbutrin before? tomorrow i'll be adding it to a slightly lowered prozac dose and was curious what experiences were uddudc
 hey friends take your dang meds all the medsnnbecause i wasnt for ages and now i am and zoloft amp; wellbutrin together are a fucking force for good
 i had to get off celexa cold turkey for valid medical reasons and it was one of the most brutal two weeks of my life tapering off wellbutrin was a nasty three weeks at the end despite the taper meds are no joke
 uddude0 uddude0 wishing you happy calm thoughts wellbutrin is a life saver for me i did well on a low dose though (i tend to be pretty sensitive to antidepressants)
 saw your reply after sending oopsniuve never taken ritalin  just buspar and wellbutrin still sending love hope it passes soon
 i take depakote wellbutrin and gabapentinnmy doctor is about to take my gabapentin away because she doesn't like to prescribe controlled substancesnnabolish the fda and let states regulate the pharmaceutical industry thamendment
 ucin the st week after quitting wellbutrin you may need to sleep a lot and constantly feel tired your depression may be worsened and you might feel as if you arenut in your body your muscles may be tense and your mental state may not be clearudnnmy weekend
 my boyfriend took wellbutrin iuve been avoiding seeing a doctor for it all my main issue is my anxiety to be honest
 wellbutrin helps tremendously
 we upped my dosage of wellbutrin u mg slow release to mg extended release it is a noticeable difference
 oh so i struggle with this two  my doctor put me on something called doxizosin which really helps  also if you take wellbutrin at night it may cause bad dreams i switched that to an extended release and now i take it in the morning iuve only had  bad dream this week so far
 yes and no i was on wellbutrin for a year but it ended up making me extremely anxious and scared i would only ever recommend that med when it's combined with a relatively full schedule and when combined with exercise nn

 i canut take wellbutrin sadly though youure not the first to recommend it i am looking into hypnotism worry that ium too much of a skeptic for it to work?
 wellbutrin can either cause weight gain or weight loss but the majority of folks seem to see weight loss since we tend to work pretty similarly on the same kind of meds i figured i'd drop straterra and go over to wellbutrin as well it's doing crazy wonders for her
 i went to my doctor asking about wellbutrin last month she looked through my papers and i was on it for  a month at the end of which i had several really violent episodes i canut try it again because i have a history of seizures now
 might be the wellbutrin and lexapro talking but i am so happy with being alive and so grateful for my friends? i canut believe i wanted to take my life at many points?
 a friend of mine finally got better on lexapro  wellbutrin  i didn't know that was a thing but it's doing great for her  talk to your doctor
 ok twitter fam i'll see y'all tonight you bring the snappy witticism i'll bring the extendedrelease wellbutrin got
 i'm saying this as someone who loves wellbutrin and uses it as part of their adhd treatment (in addition to strattera which i vastly recommend and intuniv same) but it's really not for everyone i regret letting doctors pressure me into sticking with a med i reacted badly to
 wellbutrin has a lot in common with stimulant drugs so it strikes me as odd that your doctor would use it as an anxiolytic one of the most common side effects is increased anxiety (anecdata addendum i was on it for years for depression amp; my anxiety skyrocketed)
 two of my friends tried wellbutrin and had bad experiences both were taking it for depression one had to stop because it lowered their seizure threshold the other stopped because it gave her awful panic attacks it's okay if you have to try a different medication
 wellbutrin has a ridiculously short halflife before the extended release versions came out you had to take it three times a day to keep it in your system so yeah feeling better within a few hours sounds completely plausible
 i also have a friend with ptsd adhd and depression who just started an snri  serotoninnorepinephrine increase so kind of in between wellbutrin and an ssri? too early to tell any positives but no negatives yet at least
 wellbutrin did kick in very fast for me  i felt the positives within a day and i have a friend who had a very similar experience with a standard ssri recently seems to me like it more confirms the likelihood it's not right for you
 when i found out one of the side effects of wellbutrin is explosive anger a lot of things suddenly clicked into place into how i responded to things at my last workplace (i ended up switching off of it for that very reason)
 friendship ended with ssris now wellbutrin is friend
 wellbutrin uddude0  recommend lol
 i took buspiron(think thatus the spelling) and wellbutrin and my mom and best friend take that as well they both love it a lot and i liked it a lot too the buspiron was for anxiety but i went off them to see how iud do off it and have been doing good but i did like them
 abt the alcohol and wellbutrin i used to be on it and its def not recommended but i would and i would get druuuuuu u ahhh haha i havenut had any alcohol yet but i have heard it is crazy strong also to add i checked the bottle andu 
 i'm good since i'm not popping molly every weekend anymore i went back on wellbutrin and am feeling pretty great honestly it's warm and beautiful in sf my parents just visited and i'm looking into trading up to expanders
 iuve taken prozac for a few months and it helped keep away dark thoughts and tendencies but after that i felt like i was in an emotional fog so now i am taking wellbutrin with it and together i have energy again with not being hurt as much by bad thoughts throughout the day
 i'm on a full bag of potato chips every two days habit i want to sleep all the time and there isn't enough caffeine in the world to stop me and i spend basically  of the day feeling like i'm on the brink of tears maybe i shouldn't quit wellbutrin??? drugs drugpolicy sad
 wellbutrin was horrid for me same with birth control pills before my surgery they tried me on a low dose and i ended up in the psych unit for  days until i got stable again
 ok does anyone else feel like wellbutrin makes you dissasdociate a lot and even like itus taking away your personality???u00bf adkin  a friend
 i have friends who have had good results with some combos like adding wellbutrin into the mix so you could ask about that
 wellbutrin and generic bupropion arenut twins theyure sisters or rather they arenut but they pretend to be
 sending you so much love i've been worried recently that my wellbutrin hasn't been having the same effect but i'm terrified of going through the trial and error process of finding something new or finding a new combo and my pcm is booked until mid june
 if you are already on any medications you can talk to your doctor about adding wellbutrin itus basically a stimulant type antidepressant it helps with lack of motivation itus helped me tremendously but other than that maybe just look into getting an overall good vitamin
 it absolutely cratered my testosterone levels there's no studies about this and in fact that's apparently super rare but my endo was like ah wellbutrin yeahnni again want to stress that this is apparently super rare and it does the opposite to most people
 then your friend shouldn't take wellbutrin allergic reactions to vaccines are rare
 also had a friend hospitalized with a crazy allergic reaction to wellbutrin
 yesterday was  years since i almost killed myself nni have lots of thoughts and feelings about this obviously nnbut i can sum it up with ium still here thanks to friends and wellbutrin and therapy because without any of them i wouldnut be
 all of them are hard in the beginning for one thing they all tend to upset your stomach after a couple weeks that goes away though i tried wellbutrin once too but it really wreaked havoc with my stomach try a low dose of something it is worth it if it helps
 has anybody out there had a bad reaction to the drugwellbutrin?a doctor gave it to my wife to help her quit smokingand she started having mental problems after a few weeksending in an trip to the emergency room by ambulanceafter having a compleat breakdown
 wellbutrin is also a constant effect rather than a shortacting stimulant like ritalin or adderall so it's a bigger adjustment process a lot of people just use shortactings during the day when they need to focus and then spend their eveningsweekends unmedicated
 different people react differently to meds for some including me wellbutrin was pretty much ideal amp; had virtually no side effects for others not so much i would definitely recommend talking to your doctor or pharmacist about it i hope you get the relief you need soon
 i went through horrible withdrawl from benzos and almost died same time i had stopped my wellbutrin xl i am going back on meds asap but the whole process seems so daunting and overwhelming that i donut even want to start it all over again sending love to you and yours uufe0f
 i've had the hypomanic state i initially got from wellbutrin kick in very rapidly i am not any flavor of bipolar so definitely wasn't feeling like that beforennhonestly that hypomanic state was quite a bit more fun than super depression or the psychosis a friend of mine got
 i remember that i did have some negative side effects to wellbutrin so it's not unheard of sending internet hugs hope you feel better soon
 my first two weeks on wellbutrin was pretty much one long hypomanic episode which is not an issue i'm generally prone to it took me a bit to realize that no i was not going to get that againnnhopefully it ends up working out for you after the initial two weeks
 as it starts to take effect keep an account of your memory amp; cognitive functioningnfriend of mine loved wellbutrin; worked super well felt energized amp; engaged once the first down period passednbut then had to go off of it bc her memory amp; comprehension went haywirenudeuddeudcudffe uddudc for you
 i accidentally took two  mg of wellbutrin about  minutes apart this morning now im in the middle of a neverending anxiety attack this is not fun and kinda scary
 with prozac and xanax and am doing well but the wellbutrin can potentially up anxiety quite a bit iuve found that prozac has helped most with my ed thoughts and patterns because it helps with ocd tendencies and thatus where a lot of my food issues root toubut everyone is
 um yeah my friend tried to cold turkey her wellbutrin and she was having brain zaps (that's what she called them) and was terrified for  months so i wouldn't just leap off the building maybe like take the stairs down or some shit
 before i was on zoloft and wellbutrin i would forget or not be motivated enough to do basic things like brushing my teeth i know my medication isnut the endallbeall but i wouldnut have gotten to where i am without them
 yeahi was volunteering at an emt class the other day (friend works there) and one of the patient scenarios was someone abruptly stopping wellbutrin and having serious respiratory problems in reaction hopefully everyone has a convo w their doctor first
 can't recommend highly enough combining the constant insistent halfmast of wellbutrin with the constant maybemaybenot morning peeboner ambivalence of prozac
 hubbie amp; i just went on antidepressants amp; just realized they're working cuz we didn't have a total panic attack when literally every aspect of the move changed in the last week highly recommend wellbutrin xl uddude0
 hey i know all these feelings way too well and they suck so so much to deal with (personally the thing that i did with this was find a doctor and take a shitton of wellbutrin kind of a pain to get but i recommend it if you can)
 the type of antidepressants can also a factor i am on wellbutrin and like it a lot my friends on ssris usually have a ton more side effects my main side effect is nausea and way harder to sleep 
 c'mon bud i am trying to help younnbut i didn't ask we are not friends nsorry so sorry it's the wellbutrin enabler of gogetter polypeptides makes me so aggressive nso so sorry you're right i'll wear a tank top today thank you friend nbuddy npal ngumdrop
 given your current description i would highly recommend wellbutrin (buproprion for generic) as most all of the side effects are positivebeneficial lowers anxiety more focus amp; energy etcnndm me and i'll give you not details if you want
 and i wonder how many veterans got put on wellbutrin? the f nightmares never ended only works they sure were handed pills out right and left years ago
 i have a friend with bipolar ptsd anxiety amp; depression and she was taking lexapro and wellbutrin maybe something else too? she also used cbd oil and it was life changing she stopped lexapro and the cbd oil when she got pregnant though so i'm not sure what she's doing now
 depression amp; anxiety here possibly more i've been on sertraline (uddudcd) amp; lexapro (uddudce) in the past now on wellbutrin and that's ok my recommendation is check out transcranial magnetic stimulation tmstherapy best thing i ever did couldn't keep doing it bc health insurance uddudee
 i take tegretol and buspar twice a day wellbutrin in the morning and seroquel at night i definitely recommend buspar for anxiety itus amazing and i know a lot of people who have had good luck with it
 this has the potential to start a good thread on side effects a single dose of wellbutrin in  made me lose all desire to exercise and eat at the time  of my favorite activities prozac cause me to clench my teeth was that worse than ejaculatory delay?  ask my girlfriend
 hooooooooorible absolutely the worst ssri iuve been on i recommend either prozac or maybe wellbutrin nlexapro really fucked me up
 would they prescribe joker wellbutrin? don't they avoid that for people with manic tendencies?
 im off wellbutrin baby i definitely do not recommend it
 valerian root helps mitigate all the common side effects of buproprionwellbutrin which is why the pharmacist recommended it btw

 i recommend wellbutrin it doesnut make you feel sleepy and doesnut make you gain weight (actually the opposite)
 not just any two drugs wellbutrin (which was already  marketed for smoking cessation what  years ago?) nwith robitussin nnwow how ucgroundbreakingudnnium sure the sales will be legendary udeuddudcudffcuduufe0f
 are they not tapering you off gradually? i am back on wellbutrin but iirc from when i first took it (ended yrs ago) i was tapered down and didn't have much of a withdrawal
 if you donut take wellbutrin are we really friends
 yes i liked my own tweet itus all about supporting yourself shoutout to wellbutrin and my friends and fam for helping me begin to get out of the rut
 i've had friends who've had wellbutrin and now call it hellbutrin bc it was awful for them but for me it helps me with my low energy issue and gets me going
 i just spent like  hours planning and budgeting multiple options for my honeymoon and while i usually am able to be laser focused on projects i'm pretty sure wellbutrin kicks my obsessive tendencies up at least  notches
 turns out for a small percentage of ppl using the antidepressant i use (wellbutrin) taking a particular migraine medication i've normally used (imitrex) can rather than solving your migraine send a lightning bolt between your eyes and make you cry pain tears and puke lucky me
 and also two of the enduring problems in the treatment of depression and anxiety are energy and cognitive functioning both of which can be improved with stimulants (and also wellbutrin (a little) and provigil (more energy than focus)) even in the absence of adhd
 i loved wellbutrin only it didn't love me after about  weeks i ended up in the hospital with a allergic reaction soooo sad it was like the windows were cleaned only to have the soap taken away
 i take dexedrine (mega game changer for me too) and then for the inability to start in the first place iuve added wellbutrin into the mix it pairs well with adhd meds and when i forget to take it i donut have weird antidepressant withdrawals which is great i recommend it
 ok do i switch off prozac and go back to wellbutrin and feel like my head and eyes are clouded with sand or zoloft and turn into a zombie? send halp
 my childhood friend josh carubba saw my twitter handle and asked me what wellbutrin was and i told him it was my antidepressant and he laughed

 ah i was on wellbutrin before just bc i wanted it for weight loss but it made me feel kind of blank amp; then i dated a hippie who like made me quit it bc i was obviously abusing it for the wrong reasons uddude but ium glad it works so well for you i have a few friends who love it too
 adderall used to be really effective for me but iuve been on wellbutrin (which is an antidepressant but can help w adult adhd) which has been b trying to switch to strattera to see how that goes; heard itus been v good for my friends who are on it
 ask your doctor what they recommendbut the first question i ask when a client becomes suicidal or is picking fights with peers is you on any wellbutrin?
 my dr did the same but wellbutrin ended up being terrible for my mental health i was crazy aggressive and constantly anxious among other side effects now ium on lexapro and it a go for me i hope you find what works for you
 i'm currently taking ritalin sr and trintellix  used to take wellbutrin as an antidepressant which was a bit hitormiss and then gp suggested trintellix which is fairly new  the fact that it has some unique cognitive effects is what prompted his recommendation
 i couldn't stand the taste of lamictal at all so i ended up being put on wellbutrin instead after a year i was dreading taking the medication every day and there was a pretty good chance i'd just forget eventually ') wellbutrin turns out to work better (for me) anyhow
 the insomnia side effect of the wellbutrin is very real sucks cause i wasnut sleeping anywaybut the hr extended release is def keeping me up i feel a lot less like killing myself thatus an amazing feeling i havenut felt in years
 wellbutrin allowed me to be paranoid of the trees in my own backyard would not recommend

 sorry justin i love you and am sending good vibes your way  i take wellbutrin and itus worked really well for me with no side effects    i hope you can find something that works for you and is readily available can you take a drive to ma? i think recreational is legal there

 i took wellbutrin on amp; off for years and the last time it made me angry lexapro made me violent but i'm pretty sure is because of my alcoholism  unfortunately i have bpd and have yet in  years to find something that works so i tend to selfmedicate good luck
 if a drug didnut work for you that doesnut mean it isnut highly therapeutic and effective for others i know tons of folks who love their wellbutrin it triggered a really scary episode for me i might share that with a friend but ium not out here like yuall welbutrin is poison

 could this have to do with the fact that i started on extended release wellbutrin yesterday? possibly
 class action there are a lot of us who need reimbursement for wellbutrin and extended psychological therapy
 so hereus to my new friend wellbutrin and (hopefully) better days ahead
 and the side effects are different for everyone too i got terrible insomnia from wellbutrin during college but one of my girlfriends has had no issue

 i wish i had sought out more help back then i selfmedicated with alcohol instead a lot for a long time finding the right health care providers (gp and psych) and the right ssri (lexapro prozac cymbalta) and ndri (wellbutrin) have made all the difference endthestigma 
 i love hearing that i take wellbutrin and it has helped tremendously
 i was on mg wellbutrin it's on the low dosage end what are your symptoms? to be honest for ads any and all withdrawal is bad for mental health shame on your psychiatrist (
 mg of prozac daily for me wellbutrin worked for a cousin had a friend switch from wellbutrin to prozac lots of us been there very good luck lt;
 ium on meds by choice but iuve had very bad experiences with most forms of antidepressants the only one that iuve found that isnut bad for me of the probably  or  iuve been on is wellbutrin extended release i still deal with pretty significant depression on it and my dose
 does anybody have any familiarity with wellbutrin and how it impacts anxiety? because i'm at my wit's end with this ocd shit and i'm reading forums and seeing a lot of anecdotes about wellbutrin making ocd worse and there's some clinical evidence to suggest it can
 in high school they tried to give me all sorts of pills wellbutrin and zoloft both made me feel awful ended up not taking anything until my mids i mentioned my old bipolar diagnosis to my new therapist he said i didn't have bipolar i was just being a teenager x_x
 have you ever taken vyvanse or adderall? if so like what do you feel that wellbutrin  anything else are takingu u aha yes there were several times last year that i bought some adderall from my friend who had a prescription andu 
 i was on mg of wellbutrin xl for  years and after a recurrence amp; trying the whole pharmacy ended with an extra  lbs to my already overweight frame and back on wellbutrin  nnium still fat but less depressed i so wish i could lose the weight but still winning
 everyone i knew who took wellbutrin hated it but when it was recommended by my psychiatrist i gave it a shot and it hasn't given me any of the side effects they mentioned to me (so far) i hope everyone here can find what works for them it varies so much
 thank u for the second opinion def depends on the person but itus good you were able to find stuff to counteract the anxiety i upped my buspar and my wellbutrin dosages at the same time so itus possible i woulduve gotten worse anxiety too wo the buspar so thatus def worth
 oh gods yes  i couldnut even make it six days  every third day iud skip because my body just couldnut tolerate the strain even with the extended release found out later that wellbutrin is best used as a supplemental antidepressant but by then the damage was done
 wellbutrin for gad and mde fewer panic attacks in the last  years fewer depressive episodes also helps control my appetite (i tend to binge) best decision i ever made 
 wellbutrin gave me those issues and sent me deeper into depression  i ended up taking myself off of it
 the past several days iuve felt like really good? like i want everything in my life to be beautiful and romantic and sensual and bright and shiny and i want to be friends with everyone and laugh and smile damn i guess wellbutrin  buspar are really doing it for me huh
 i know i should have i always close up but started to open up half way through i think he got it(pray he did)home now and anxiety is gone he changed my meds on prozac now along with wellbutrin hope it helps thank you my kind friend uddude0uddudc
 ahaha same i got an ed generalized anxiety severe depression and the guy started asking me about manic behaviors at the end and i was like hell no ium not getting another diagnosis give me my wellbutrin and let me go be fucked up and happy on my own

 ugh uddude i can see how it happens though i was down to  calories a day would lose  lbs in a month then go on a weekend trip and gain back  my gp said that was impossible but my weight loss doc believed me keto and contrave have been my saviors
 i highly recommend gene testing if it's available first wellbutrin is a wonderdrug for some but for some unfortunate others it has increased suicidality to the point of hospitalization source me 
 i guess it depends why you're taking itnni know wellbutrin and celexa can help w anxiety and depressionnnhydroxyzine is mostly for anxietynbut it's an antihistamine it's basically just benadrylnnif you aren't sensitive to antihistamines worth a shotnjust a totally diff class
 happened to one of my friends thankfully i didnut have as severe a reaction but uhhhhh yeah wellbutrin is that bitch sometimes even when sheus helping me out
 i keep trying to get my shipmates to join my one person onboard knitting club listen i just upped my lexapro and wellbutrin and got a full nightus sleep theyure gonna saying ucpurl the bumpud on a x rib stitch by the end of my  hours
 i was on er dilaudid plus norco and my pain was still insane ended up in hospital for uncontrolled pain stopped taking it and now take prozac but i donut notice any issues on it at all and maybe wellbutrin  pain was pure coincidence but ium off er meds and down on norco
 wellbutrin made me want to punch holes in walls i recommend stop taking it nni tried multiple antidepressants amp; none of them worked until my internist put me on effexor xr it was a game changer amp; is meant for people whard to treat depression i'm on maximum dose amp; feel great
 i was on wellbutrin for  days  i ended up being part of that small percentage where you become suicidal its been really discouraging since haha
 i feel this so hard went to the doctors yesterday and am starting wellbutrin along with my zoloft sending love your way uddudc
 also to be super transparent and hopefully helpfulueffexor was horrible for me amp; scared me away from meds for a long time recently started taking wellbutrin after an in depth evaluation amp; omg uddude i feel like a normal person for the st time ever sending love amp; luck amp; patience
 yup i think there is freedom in letting go and saying ucium packed anything forgotten can be worked around or bought on the other endud wellbutrin helps )
 ium still sick and the constant feelings of general hopelessness and anxiety have been brutal and seem neverendingnnsorta worried itus some weird reaction to wellbutrin but my situation is fr looking pretty grim that combined with withdrawals from opiates has been awful
 yeah i hear ya i'm on wellbutrin for that very thing the more engaged you can be the happier i live on social media have friends to reach out to and my hubby is the best hang in there ) (oh and prg is looking for reviewers if you want to do that)
 but recently i upped the dosage of wellbutrin to see if the fatigue would get even better it didn't combo of escitalopram and the higher dose of wellbutrin gave me constant suicidal ideation and sh so now i'm on the lower dose again and depend on coffee
 i've found that cns stimulants tend to calm me down more than make me anxious and i have adhd so maybe there's a connectionnnwellbutrin makes me super anxious if the dose is high enough though
 ium a big fan of zoloft and it helps several of my friends and family members as well but perhaps i need to go back to an atypical antidepressant like wellbutrin (but not wellbutrin obviously as i ruined its effectiveness) and see if one of those works best for me
 thank you though unless i find someone willing to send me wellbutrin i'm just gonna have to keep going the way i do so far
 day  on wellbutrin i have a headache but otherwise feel normal (compared to yesterday lol) pretty sure the headache is from a lack of caffeine( i am trying to not drink dr pepper unless ium with friends and thatus demolished my caffeine intake
 it took three attempts over  years for me to find the right one but then again more meds have become available over time in  i tried ritalin increased my anxiety and irritability wellbutrin made me very woozy strattera ended up being quite good
 wellbutrin was actually the straw that broke the camelus back and stopped me from going to psychiatrists  taking medication they never did anything for me anyway besides horrendous side effects
 oh i just took it that x it gave me ss within  hours nnssris tend to do that we thought wellbutrin would be different but no that's the last of the antidepressant trial runs for me

 i was prescribed wellbutrin years ago i had a seizure saw the cheif of neurology amp; after many tests he told me to never take wellbutrin again i have a plethora of medical diseases and conditions may have just been all my disabilities but i wonut ever recommend it to anyone
 you can't blanket statement say don't take medications you don't know the specific situation talk to your doctor depending on what the wellbutrin is for it can be most effective in combination with therapy be well and take care of you
 i didn't have any side effects with wellbutrin and i've been on at least  other antidepressants that all had side effects to some degree i'd recommend wellbutrin
 i was on antidepressants for a while (and sometimes lowkey think they might still be helpful) first med i was on (wellbutrin) fucked up my hearing as an unintended side effect but it also made my depression way more manageable
 he was on cymbalta a few yrs ago they added (un)wellbutrin amp; he ended up wserotonin syndrome thankfully he's not currently on any of those types of meds his oncologist wants him on an ssri but he's refused
 wellbutrin messed me up for a while until i realized i can't take the extended release once i switched to the instant and raised the dose  i started doing a lot better just gotta find that balance
 that hasnut been my experience with prozac i have gone up in dosage mostly because it wasnut doing the intended effect ium up to mg on top of including wellbutrin but definitely consult your doc
 this really depends on the person for me it got better the longer i was on it but at first i just felt groggy and generally disinterested in things (sex  hobbies activities) if you feel this ask about adding wellbutrin and it really helps
 prozac really messed with my body and i couldnut stay on it i suggest getting ahold of the doctor i got put on wellbutrin xl and itus been a godsend
 definitely see a therapist as well therapy helps with coping techniques and also they spend a lot more time with you so if the wellbutrin does not work out they can talk with your pysch and give them a better idea of something that can work better for you )
 i had that issue it's why i switched to wellbutrin which is terrible to come off of but didn't have that frustrating side effectnmy depression tends to present as anxiety i hope that helps
 have heard from friends it's one of the hardest things they have doneseveral recommended chantix or better the cheaper generic form of wellbutrin same drug different name and because chantix is new not just new indication it costs moretakes the urge away to smoke  best  u

 hey remember that twitter conversation about add? turns out i don't meet criteria but i have tendencies which works well with my anxiety and depression (sarcasm) sooo i'm getting wellbutrin to add to my prescription list for executive functioning dopamine etc
 god you sound you a  year old school girl if youure not taking wellbutrin or prozac i recommend making a dr appointment immediately or up the dosage
 i like it the best so far iuve also tried prozac (didnut work weight gain) and wellbutrin (worked but with an allergic reaction) but luvox doesnut give me side effects that i know of itus low key but it helps me and my brother (autism ocd) so iud recommend it
 i mean if youure taking wellbutrin xanax and ambien and still canut sleep no amount of lavender oil is going to fix that mess

 yes so you would expect the achv data to be worse further out  however the placebo responses were higher in the chantixzyban data so its probably a wash in the end

 it's weird i still have my occasional down and anxious moments but they're so much easier to get past they don't feel world ending anymore wellbutrin is a hell of a drug
 nthe therapist had to (in the past) go on anti depression meds like wellbutrin during the winter months like othersnnone loved one i had was also feeling the same way and the therapist recommended some vitamin changes and the results were amazing totally different person

 cont i highly recommend wellbutrin itus been great for my sluggishfatigue symptoms and it helped that it also helped me lose lb after gaining from nursing school it made me feel more confident they may recommend a second med for anxiety though which i use also
 i tried wellbutrin (an absolute hell drug from experience and stories other friends have told me) that ended in me being a raging bitch for weeks on end and effexor which made me vomit every day for a week straight until i couldn't stand it anymore
 like every medicine you have to counterweight the risk vs the benefit try something that has higher success rate with lower doseagerrisk wellbutrin? depending on the problem of course depression is biologicalchemical and sometimes you need medicine to reset the brain
 well friends looks like iull be adding wellbutrin to my lexapro because dysphoria related anxiety 
 they ended up switching me to wellbutrin yesterday because zoloft wasnut working out too well for me

 i am on extended release wellbutrin and it's honestly probably the med that's consistently helped the most but it also has some very sucky side effects lol i think i'm on  mg but literally my memory is so bad that i don't even know
 lexapro fucks and has fucked up my memory for years i tried out wellbutrin for awhile but only a mg dose wellbutrin ended up adding too much anxiety to be worth it for me
 i completely understand truly i do uddude if i can offer a tidbit if you and your doctor wanna try antidepressants everyone i know recommends wellbutrin i canut take it unfortunately but it seems very successful for most so you may want to mention that to them
 wellbutrin is actually known for helping with the fatigue depression can cause so it is recommended to take in the am to prevent insomnia
 ugh thatus so frustrating i have the opposite problem ium always struggling to sleep have you considered a med like wellbutrin? helps depression and also kind of revs up the body (take it in the morning) if you donut have panic issues i recommend it
 if you're worried that you just pooped out your wellbutrin experts recommend turning around and eating the poop
 ever since my friend permabanned shitpostwr pointed out that bupropionwellbutrin is in tje same class of drugs as bath salts i have been fascinated with the case reports of the drug apparently unmasking psychotic disorders and schizophrenia etc

 zoloft never works for me and lexapro never worked alone but i finally ended up on a combo of lexapro and wellbutrin and it seriously world amazing the only reason i ended up in a manic episode was because geisinger fucked up my meds while i was sick

 some drugs can be used for different conditions dependant on the dose eg neuroleptics can be antipsychotics amp; antiseizure i use abnormally high doses of bupropion for treatmentresistant major depression (wellbutrin) in smaller doses itus used to quit smoking (zyban)
 wellbutrin helped my friend prioritize tasks but it made me extremely depressednconcerta lets my mom run errands without being over stimulated exhausted and my yo says they can finish a task without distractionninteresting to see how differently people respond to meds
 you still have cravings thereus a better drug they used in the us when insurance was not for profit wellbutrin itus antidepressant but used to stop smoking thereus no side affects no cravings and you donut gain weight my friend stopped smoking on it and was happy doing it
 antidepressants saved my life they can be scary if you try the wrong one but at the end of the day the right one or right combo are totally life changing nnwellbutrin is the shit
 i take wellbutrin which is nice since it doesnut affect sex drive and doesnut make me tired want to try buspar for anxiety after my brother recommended it

 yeah wellbutrin rules super smooth ride i took it for years still recommend it
 do any of my followers have experience taking wellbutrin? i'm being recommended to go off lexapro to that and i wanted to get some first hand insight before i make the switch
 after trying a few different things i am on concerta and wellbutrin sometimes i will skip the concerta on the weekends so that i can get more sleep but i did have a bad adhd skip day a few months ago that reminded me why i take it to begin with

 i almost ended up dead on wellbutrin it was a bad time
 wellbutrin is truly a godsend
 and to be fair it wasnut all a money thing it was also partially a genderstereotype thing and now that i think about it possibly an adhd thingnni started really getting into games in the last year when iuve wanted to my whole life nni started wellbutrin last march nudeuddf
 wellbutrin for me took almost a decade for anyone to even recommend it (years of being prescribed the latest and greatest with awful side effects and no real improvement) less than  weeks on wellbutrin and i felt uchumanud for the first time eternally greatful it works for me
 thatus interesting because those outbursts can come par for the course and adderal lends me a longer fuse nnwellbutrin made me sooo weepy and the doc said heud never seen that before nnit really can be different for every brain udeudd
 depends on the med i believe wellbutrin was the worst  its marketed as zyban for smoking cessation too and many people i know who have taken zyban have had horrible nightmares and violent urges  nncitalopramcelexa wasnt too bad nneffexor has limited my dreaming
 wellbutrin was a nightmare for me (i got super manic and suicidal) so i dont reccomend it at allnni've been on prozac for  months now and it's worked wonders for me i dont notice any side effects but tbf i'm on a lot of meds so it's hard to tell what causes what exactly
 no i've never been able to quit hypnosis wellbutrinaccupuncture patches gum and vape and that book you recommended  i'm physically addicted to nicotine and have been for  years sad but true
 there are a couple of nonstimulant ones out there that might work (they are off label uses) wellbutrin (bupropion) is an light antidepressant that apparently works wonders for some modafinil is technically a stimulant used for narcolepsy but tends to cause much less anxiety
 oof i'm sorry friend idk if i'm going to stick with it i'll hopefully be able to consult with a psychiatrist soon but it's what i've been on for ish years amp; it was working well paired with therapy for a while i've been thru zoloft wellbutrin prozac amp; effexor uddude

 i am towards the end weaning off venlafaxine ium down to taking half of  mg a day i still wake up every morning w dizziness and nausea i am now on wellbutrin (dopamine uptake) and it works better for me i hate meds
 it depends on the med the first time i took adderall i felt it right away it was life changing with wellbutrin which for me treats depression first and anxiety nd it takes a week or two
 thatus why ium excited to get insurance back so i can get back on wellbutrin there were some annoying side effects of wb (i got super tired every day at pm even on weekends; suppresses hunger so i would forget to eat occasional headache)but it made me happy and not feel doom

 i ended up being part of the small  where wellbutrin makes you a suicidal mess tried it for  days then noped it out of my lifennbut then again that's probably because i was misdiagnosed with depression when i have bipolar type

 wellbutrin is in the same class but is less zappy imo what i really recommend is getting genesight testing done they do a dna test to see which meds are best for you based on your genes and which ones you should avoid saves lots of hassle they do income based payment too
 my friend was just subscribed wellbutrin to help her quit smoking

 has for me personally on cymbalta overall they tend to have less sexual side effects than the usual ssris that get prescribed so imo worth trying the switch if you canut stand not being able to cum can also try to add something like wellbutrin instead of changing meds entirely

 need to get back on wellbutrin amp; prozac because my posting ability has suffered tremendously
 ium on both it depends on what you are treating mostly anxiety or depression i do sometimes feel a little spacey on both but at the same time ium always mellow and in a ucdonut give a shitud mood lexapro and wellbutrin are usually paired and go together very well ask the doc

  what camryn said i was on lexapro first and it made me worse so i asked to be put on wellbutrin and my doc gradually had me switch over (as i was still taking lexapro) amp; it made me fell better ium now on zoloft too which is the best mix for me it just depends on your body
 wellbutrin; balances your mental health and increases you libido some antidepressants can tend to fw your sex drive when you initially start taking itn  for some it goes away for some it doesnut personally didnut go away for me so yeah 
 uhm wellbutrin i can take it amp; it will suppress my appetite  makes me feel like a skinny legend until a eat a big ass meal at am bc it wore off 
 wait wellbutrin has made me and some close familyfriends go insane be careful w this one and make sure the closest ppl to u keep and eye on you
 wellbutrin  but i take it with risperdal and iuve gained  pounds in a year ) donut recommend risperdal
 everyone is saying wellbutrin but medicine reacts differently to everyone i gained weight with wellbutrin so it really depends lol 
 lexapro helped with my depression and anxiety but wellbutrin made my libido spike and also made me not a fat hungry bitch all the time highly recommend the mg xl tabs x a day with mg lexapro at night with a side of cbd oil and removal of all men in ur life
 also my ob put me on wellbutrin after i had my second baby for my depression i went in  weeks later to follow up ended up seeing the np cause my doctor had to go into delivery the np asked me if i was on wb for the endo stuff when i said no she was shocked

 hello wellbutrin my old friend 
  anyone else have this happen? on wellbutrin for  days exhausted suicidal miserable then wake up day   like a new person energy normal want to see friends and do stuff much better
 i had a friend who accidentally took two of her wellbutrin in one day (i think she was on  or ) and her heart rate went up super high and she started having mild hallucinations
 ugh this made me smile and remember to take my wellbutrin and write a few sentences of a luv letter to a friend udcudfeudcudfbu 
 wellbutrin is probably my best friend iuve never looked back nni wish that we could always give each other space to be human i mean what else is there?

 thanks so much sweetheart xanax and wellbutrin are my best friends right now
 wellbutrin makes me break out in a bright red rash from head to toe and could send me into anaphylactic shocki love it so much )
 if you didnut know this wellbutrin is great bc i no longer think about death all the time but i rarely eat during eating hours oh yea im also losing my ass you canut have it all friends
 i reccomend wellbutrin for productivity theyre basically mania pills but they make me anxious so trade offs

 bupropion (wellbutrin) is a nonstimulant uddude0a  it depends on the person so much; i had zero side effects on it and it helped me get nonmotivating chores done today i decided to get back on it after a long break i asked about strattera as i wondered if i should try it instead
 just depends on your body a lot of people get nauseous and donut want to eat so it could have a weight loss effect because of that all antidepressants have the possibility of weight gain except wellbutrin but thatus less of an antidepressant and more of a mood stabilizer udcudfudeuddf
 i was on celexa for a while and during a particular terrible place in my life my therapist added wellbutrin as well and that combo ended up being perfect for me i worked through and am back to only celexa now but that was a big help
 lexapro is the best thing to happen to me wellbutrin is likely why i ended up trying to go kaput
 iuve been on sertraline for years mostly positive experience (except ium essentially a born again virgin cuz sex is not an interest smh my poor boyfriend) added wellbutrin in the am too but didnut fix the sex drive thing tho gave me a bit more energy every day
 had a pretty negative experience feeling numbemotionless amp; not being able to comprehend feelingscry i felt zombieish made my anxiety and depression x worse also had pretty bad dreams amp; would tend to be restless wellbutrin worked way better but everyone is different
 honestly ssris are so personal as to whether they work for you no ones experience will rly be a good indicator if it works unfortunately i have a friend who swears by wellbutrin but it made me super irritable itus worth a shot usually bc you never know
 i have add amp; depression and have tried a bunch of meds my biggest issue was fatigue bc iud feel more depressed but increasing my adderall isnut a treatment for depression so my psychiatrist added wellbutrin and itus made a huge difference tho iuve had friends who hated it
 i should amend that i know people who were on them temporarily nwellbutrin can be taken temporarily
 imagine not being physically and mentally exhausted so you can hang out with friends can't relate nngoodnight hope my wellbutrin pills come faster because i've been out the past week and i'm too stubborn to call my psychiatrist for some pills because i told her i'd be fine and i
 huh you're the nd person who has said that about wellbutrinndid you get the exhaustion though?nfriend of mine got so sluggish and forgetful on it they had to switch off uddudec
 i felt that way for years after quitting then i went on wellbutrin for unrelated reasons and the cravings flipped off like a switch this is in no way a product recommendation just a pleasantly surprising side effect

 your pcp should be able to prescribe meds for you especially if you voice concern over not being able to financially see a specialistnni highly recommend wellbutrin felt a huge difference on day  with mg it's an absolute miracle drug
 as of yesterday ium back at my full dosage of my old friend wellbutrin and ium already having really weird vivid dreams ending in me waking up soaked in sweat donut remember specifics but maybe i shouldnut read batman books after trivia and finishing a time travel comic 
 sure and i take a generic form of wellbutrin same drug different name nni mean dig in man the more you fight every reasonable effort to decrease gun violence the faster the gun ban will arrive fine by mennmuting you now i've got other conversations to attend to
 hey bipolar friends and bipolarclub  thought youud be interested to know that my seroquel will be changing to abilify and my effexor will be changing to a small dose of prozac ium still on wellbutrin gabapentin and clonazepam my psychiatrist likes
 when i was ing my friend i miswritten ucwellud and it autocorrected to ucwellbutrinud
 the wellbutrin helps tremendously it removes your desire to smoke itus affordable (generic) and will help so much donut let them talk you into chantix because itus terribly expensive and doesnut work as well as wellbutrin good luck and godspeed
 donut do thatuyou might end up with some pretty bad withdrawal symptoms depending on what youure on and youull overall experience some shitty mood changes not all meds will kill you (like wellbutrin gives you seizures) youull be better off either not doing anything or get help
 then definitely consider antidepressants udeudde ium on wellbutrin and lamictal and this combo makes my life great just donut be discouraged at first my friend tried wellbutrin and it made her depression worse itus a lot of trial and error you already know but ium excited for you
 so l'm on wellbutrin for a few days now and apparently l have a sense for time now before this l'd spend three hours doing stuff amp; it'd feel like minutesnnnow l can actually time travel somehow????????? like whatever l do it feels like clocks run muuuuuuch slower now adhd
 like three times the recommended dosage i took ml liquid without reading the box and the recommended was ml and not to exceed ml in  hrs also my wellbutrin apparently increases the effects of delsym 
 only three days in but so far this wellbutrin has been a godsend
 anyone with experience with wellbutrin please tell me your stories? i'm not sure i want to take it but it's been recommended
 i've been on wellbutrin probably a total of like  years? it feels like every  years it's not enough and i try something else but always end up back on wellbutrin bc everything else has worse side effects
 the same thing happened to me when i was on wellbutrin long term so i ended up going off of it and now ium on a new antidepressant pristiq that is working better but i lowkey hate that antidepressants arenut meant to be taken long term uddude
 i often put off my after work or after class shower and just sit in a chair on my nintendo switch procrastinatingbut becoming more anxious then two hours go by and i am like oh and i used to take wellbutrin but i had similar side effects and that medicine got yeeted
 i wanted to combo wellbutrin with my ssri amp; my doctor was hesitant so i went for wellbutrin only and it has worked out great maybe it pairs with fluoxetine in which case i would really recommend it over shorter lasting stuff like adderall
 i totally bummed out a friend and organizer by sharing my predictions for how this election cycle will go it was dark i need the sun to return andor to get that wellbutrin prescription filled
 if any of you are cig smokers who have struggled to quit ium getting my mom to try a solution the drug zyban  nicotine patches if you want to know how it goes let me know zyban is extended release wellbutrin which helps with the lower dopamine levels when u quit

 it just depends on ur brain chemistry if ur problem is low serotonin then theyll likely help youbut it can be hard to pinpoint which hormone exactly needs adjusting my drs tried me on like  ssris that made me feel awful before i tried an ndri(wellbutrin)amp; it's worked reallyu

 i just started going back on wellbutrin which has been a personal necessity i say this not as some recommendation to resume some medication regimine but just that i feel you
 i would if it were legal in tx i hate having to take psych meds but it's keeping me alive i do have some good ones like klonopin i've got an appointment to get wellbutrin which my veteran friend with ptsd takes to deal with his symptoms i need to stop smoking pipe tobacco
 and now i donut have insurance but i have a friend who does and he was prescribed wellbutrin and he gave it to me for free
 abilify has been pretty wonderful to me and so has wellbutrin clonidine which is a blood pressure medication is great off label for anxiety iuve also been using thc and shrooms for depression and anxiety both under recommendation and supervision of doctors
 ium on prozac and wellbutrin and the combo seems to help also heard good things about celexa and lexapro i had a horrible reaction to zoloft and so did most of my friends (it turned me into a zombie) but ymmv they all react differently for different people unfortunately

 some friends said they quit using wellbutrin said forgot to smoke 
 wellbutrin isn't extended release he just took his meds weird
 i think it will also would highly recommend a baseline dose of wellbutrinbupropion for adhd management stacks really well with conventional approaches like amphetamines
 finally got a new psychiatrist (and a new nongender therapist) adjusted my meds for the first time since  have me on max wellbutrin dosage my teeth are vibrating ium sure itus fine and i just need to adjust we might add a stimulant in later
 dude that lasts sentence i felt so hard i always try to explain to people who donut take it what it feels like but ium never able to get the point across but iull def mention wellbutrin to my psychiatrist after all this ends
 i've been off wellbutrin since the end of december and i've been handling it fine but i think i can feel the downward spiral coming lmao
 depends some can but if itus an issue then your dr can move you to something else that doesnut do that ium on wellbutrin and mines gone up udeudd
 does he somehow think this makes him sound knowledgeable? i think most people are aware of off label prescriptions there's a difference between my psychiatrist recommending wellbutrin and the president talking up a dangerous drug combo for a disease we know little about
 my friend who has taken the wellbutrin told me it gave him weird dreams so that was my source haha
 awe shoot ium sorry i had really horrible reactions to a lot of antidepressants (prozac pristiq paxil effexor viibryd) before i found the ones that work for me being lexapro and wellbutrin zoloft was okay but it crapped out on me eventually for me lexapro is a godsend
 well it will be interesting to see how wellbutrin works it's also something they recommend for adhd
 ium kinda worried that i was on mg of wellbutrin sr and now ium on mg of wellbutrin extended release bc they donut exactly work the same way
 we donut make new drugs we take wellbutrin and add it to naltrexone and boom new weight oss drug uddude0 take phentermine and the anticonvulsant topomax new diet drug take prozac and make it a drug for pmds no ramp;d just marketing spend and profit 
 ium not opposed to any diagnosis though as long as my ass get some help and man itus life changing wellbutrin literally drove me insane and i kept telling my pcp and they kept adjusting the doses i tend to be a very compliant person so i kept taking it it was awful
 this is me i get so irritable then overwhelmed at being in a shitty mood then i shut down it's how i learned that a specific generic maker of wellbutrin did not work for me ineffective extended release efficacy curve meant that i'd wake up angry it was horrible

 i understand  nwellbutrin saved my life when combined with the friendship of very good people  nright now is a great time to indulge ourselves in good books small treats twitter
 uca case in point would be zyban (wellbutrin bupropion) which depending on which country you live in may be approved for smoking cessation or the treatment of major depression or bothud
 nope thereus way more options but that obviously depends where you live strattera and wellbutrin are both non stimulant medication to help treat adhd there is also adderall and ritalin like you said but also vyvanse mydayis concerta and probably more i donut know about
 oh shit i just coughed my wellbutrin pill into my cup of chamomile lavender tea so thatus how my sundayus starting
 and it took years for me to find out which meds work for me and which ones donut itus a tough process but itus worth it so far ium on lexapro wellbutrin and abilify all of which i would recommend however i had a terrible experience with effexor
 grapefruit is an agonist to the receptor that processes wellbutrin it amplifies the effects beyond doctor recommendation

 bad news yearold cooped up inside plus dawn marie working from home in our tiny apartment plus no con income is going to be toughnngood news when i took out recycling and saw nonbrokendown boxes in there i was not consumed by rage so i guess the wellbutrin is kicking in?
 my friend took wellbutrin and loved it for the first year then his depression came back  fold out of nowhere did you ever feel like that happened for you?
 another bad time was trokendi the extended release version of topomax which is currently interfering with my vyvanseus efficacy along with the wellbutrin i guess i look most forward to the ambien tomorrow
 tbh it just makes me more wakeful than anything i find which is helpful on those days i really need something to be able to motivate me without it i tend to feel really sluggishn i think the escitalopram i'm also on is what helps with mood regulation more than the wellbutrin
 but not good if you have intense anxiety and insomnia can be useful thought for those with mostly adhd and depression wellbutrin is also a sdri inhibiting uptake of dopamine rather than serotonin so it would depend on which your body needs or adapts to more
 i alienated a lot of people good friends who don't talk to me to this day (and some that forgave me) i finally went off the paxil (and wellbutrin) cold turkey

 my dreams are often vivid since i started taking wellbutrin but quarantine dreams have gotten epic seemingly endless like multiple different movies spliced together each overlapping a bit
 ium currently on wellbutrin i am a friend of ninaus
 it's amazing how differently ppl react to drugs i was prescribed wellbutrin to suppress my appetite after i gained weight after going off of vyvanse but it didn't do that for mennmy friend who's on  mg of wellbutrin stopped relapsing and feels better than ever on it
 when i was on wellbutrin i didnut feel the sense of impending doom like i did before everything just felt lighter and i was more relaxed
 wellbutrin has been the only meds that actually makes me feel like a human being and not a robot highly recommend
 if you have add tendencies itus good too because it helps with dopamine i was started on prozac and it honestly made me want to end my shit wellbutrin is just starting to kick in for me and itus been good
 ium not sure of your disorder but ium bipolar amp; those  wellbutrin  endless others intensified everything i literally had to detox amp; that was true physicalmental pain my new doc said antidepressantspsychotics will make bipolar much worse mood stabilizers only
 hundreds of medications are prescribed for reasons that it was not originally intended for cymbalta although i wouldn't recommend it to my worse enemy is an antidepressants now used to treat fibromyalgia wellbutrin amp; chantix both antidepressants used to help ppl quit
 also new approved indications or combos allow pharmacos to extend or regain their patents ( day flu treatment dosing of azithryomycin gt; zpac) or repurpose the product for side effects (wellbutrin gt; zyban or contact gt; dexatrim)
 id like to thank my psychiatrist for prescribing me wellbutrin just in time for me to be off the rails horny for quarantine and id also like to extend a prayer to her and her newborn child who i intuit is a girl not to gender her baby
 actually it might be because i took my evening wellbutrin late took it about an hour ago then like  minutes ago after an extended period of being extremely anxious emotional and depressed i just suddenly chilled the heck out
 it took me a while of bugging my friend to go to the doctors he now takes wellbutrin amp; feels great i asked him if he needed meds for his uufe0f  would he take them he said yes i said then whatus the difference? so he went to the doctors with a new attitude towards mental health
 wellbutrin has been the only antidepressant iuve been on that has actually made me feel better and hasnut decreased my sex drive and iuve basically tried all of them highly recommend asking your doctor about it if youure not liking what youure on udeuddudcudffb
 and the thing is wellbutrin is a pretty good drug that mostly works for what he recommended (getting your sex drive back while on ssris) i can see how that started a slippery slope of ethical decline in his narcissistic brain
 lmao every anti dep is different and it all depends on the person taking it too so theres really no telling which side effects youull get udeuddudcudffbuduufe0f have heard good stuff about effexor though i personally like wellbutrin a lot too once i got used to it
 i am not familiar with those meds but with my depression i was on prozac amp; lexapro and those made me feel very numb but wellbutrin was the only one that worked for me ) but everyone is different i also think wellbutrin can be recommended due to it not affecting ur sexdrive
 my wellbutrin and i send love from omaha
 i loooove wellbutrin its my favorite careful if youure a heavy drinker though as you could end up going a little gaga in the bad way uddude0
 i havenut had a biopsy but iuve been clinically diagnosed i tried cymbalta for a while but it made my pots worse i do ok with wellbutrin but i think adding another med intended to keep norepinephrine in my system was just too much for me
 there is a future lesson here  please biotwitter do not put your money in a b company marketing delsym boosted generic wellbutrin  it will not end well axsm
 wellbutrin is a weird drug no? i've taken it and yikes but it seems to work a grad school friend credits her smoking cessation to wellbutrin and a new tattoo
 i am so socially awkward that i don't know how to start or carry a proper conversation that might lead to a good friendship nni don't know what is wrong with me amp; i wish there was a pill i could take that would make everything better but the most i can get is wellbutrin
 lexapro is very scalable you can start with a low dose and titrations up until you hit the sweet spot they usually start with wellbutrin but a lot of my clients have had side effects they tend to like lexapro better

 when youure ready you should look into wellbutrin it helps tremendously with quitting and you donut have to wean off of it or anything
 i highly recommend wellbutrin improves your mood a lot sleep better amp; make u more able to function uddudcd
 got prescribed wellbutrin for  days have to see what happens then but this is a big step for me hope you guys have a good fridayweekend
 true i am one of those dependent on smokescheaper than wellbutrin as i cannot afford medical aidudeudd
 good luck to my wellbutrin this weekend
 oh no yeah it served me really well i'll keep on my wellbutrin until the end of summer and reassess i'm pretty happy to finally feel a turn around uufe0f
 i would say about a month it is possible that it might not be the right medication for you or you need a higher dose i take citalopram at night to help with sleeping due to anxiety i have a friend who has only done well on wellbutrin i hope it works for you soon
 the blue pill in the matrix is wellbutrin and in the con of the movie it's an allegory for repressing being transgender
 send me good vibes  my doc said i could pause my wellbutrin dose and see if it improves my symptoms ironically ium getting used to the pvcs udeudd
 se vende nwellbutrin xl  mgnlamictal  mgnviora  nprogynova mg ncoveram mgmg n antofagasta
 fast forward to yesterday when i found out that second pill wellbutrin is known as poor man's cocaine and can send users hurtling into euphoria what i was experiencing wasn't how most people feel all the timeui was just high and loving it
 so my doc took me off of the wellbutrin since i've been having bad palpitations  today's the first day without it and jeeeeesus i have no energy and i just cannot focus  send help xd
 if you havenut tried it already iud reccomend asking your doc about wellbutrin itus much more gentle than some of the others and was a lifesaver for me some of the others just felt like a brick wall in my head i had to try to push my thoughts through a tiny hole one at a time
 ah yes may  the day i take my wellbutrin and vyvanse at the same time to avoid having any sort of emotion for eight hours (not recommended by my therapist) ucudcudffb
 yes esp wellbutrin bc that needs to be monitored pretty well (i had an awful time with it and ended up in the hospital bc my psychiatrist was bad and didnut like check on me)
 i havenut been able to sleep for shit all week i fall asleep and wake up  hours later and thatus the end of my sleeping for the rest of the night i think itus because i finally got my prescription of wellbutrin (my antidepressant) and itus fucking with me
 wellbutrin tends to have fewer side effects if you're not keen on meds finding a good therapist who does cbt might be the way to go
 fwiw i still drink even while on wellbutrin and i havenut noticed any difference (tho i rarely get shitfaced or anything) i think it depends more on the dosage as mine is kinda smallnnbest of luck iuve been way happier on wellbutrin so hereus hoping it works for u too
 me in  convincing my doctor to switch my antidepressants from sertraline to wellbutrin so i could lose weight while lying about being dependant on lorazepam 
 wellbutrin made my ears ring like crazy and actually did not help my depression and anxiety at all and i think it made me more psycho lmao i donut recommend but it does kill your appetite and u can do sexy time on it at least i had switch to something else tho in the end 
 wellbutrin amplified my suicidal thoughts tendencies so badly i remember doing the dishes one night and thinking ucwhat if i just run this steak knife through my wristsud i really hope no one has a similar reaction to it bc they saw it on tik tok 
 wellbutrin is bupropion it was marketed for a long time as a smoking cessation drug (nicoban or somesuch) it gives me a straight  energy with no weirdness or fogginess i recommend it
 the reason i said that btw is that i know a lot of people on two anti depressants and it wrecked them i actually ended up on wellbutrin only because i demanded a medicine that didn't hinder sex drive i also said i don't want a pill colony udeudduduufe0f
 also good to note wellbutrin is commonly found to make people lose weight so if you do take it it would be good to make sure your weight wasnut shifting too dramatically as for its effect on your sex drive it rly all just depends on ur bodyus chemistry
 do people actually think wellbutrin is something cool and trendy now bro
 wellbutrin really boosted my mood no shitty side effects like ssris itus helped me tremendously good luck
 wellbutrin fucked me up ended up gaining weight and was a major contributing factor in almost taking my life a few years agonnno thanks just hand me the pistol next time
 good luck they ended up putting me on wellbutrin and testosterone therapy hugs
 wellbutrin has also helped historically in the past with combination of lexapro nnot on wellbutrin anymore because med complications but i recommend nhope this helps you and anyone else wondering same things
 i don't recommend benzos because they're very addictive and cause lethal physical withdrawals but stuff like ssris wellbutrin seroquel etc are a lot more safe there's risks with everything but benzos are the scariest imo
 hey if the lexapro (ium guessing) doesnut turn out to be the thing for you donut be afraid to have your doctor switch you around i ended up on wellbutrin
 this account might become boring bc ium getting a pill calendar to stop me from taking wellbutrin x a day by accident
 wellbutrin is my boyfriend
 friendship ended with wellbutrinnnow sprigg report ends my depression
 i tried a bunch of the stimulants for adhd but they all ended up making me super anxious i'm on wellbutrin now and it's working well i just started lexipro as well for my (nonside effect) anxiety hoping that will help too
 we are two months in and i think they should send us some free wellbutrin and a butt ton of edibles nnand some more money nnthe edibles will also keep more people on their couch so uddudcc
 may have psychologically scarred a friend by telling them about wellbutrin abusennim still a good person
 wellbutrin or dxm? answer for both is by mouth per labeled instructions possibly in slightly greatest quantities and not for intended purposes but basically just the normal way
 thanks friend feeling good still i've had semisuccess with it before (wellbutrin) but was never quite right i've been taking lexapro amp; dexedrine (anxietydepressionadhd) but it never was quite right adding wellbutrin has made all the difference in the world udeudd
 ?ngad sad bipolar ii bipolar i and ptsdnnpretty sure the bipolar i dx is correct (at least the latuda viibryd wellbutrin amp; cymbalta combo is working)nni had suspected for years that i was somewhere on the autistic spectrum (aside  does it tend run in families?)
 it depends on what you take you have to keep working with your doctor and find out what works for you i settled on wellbutrin or bupropion whatever keep fighting
 my wellbutrin fucks with my temperature i do not see this ending well
 i picked up my phone to turn it off so i could focus on my hw but ended up on twitter for an hour have had mg caffeine amp; wellbutrin my insurance wonut cover adhd meds bc ium an adult amp; my psych told me i couldnut have it bc ium ucnot a hyper little kidud i hate you all
 getting better still looking for a job but my area's lockdown was lifted so i'll have more opportunities getting over the breakup was tough but the wellbutrin helped a good bit got to see some irl friends recently and they helped encourage me to take steps forward
 it really is if you have access to medication that isn't specifically for adhd i know some people have good results with wellbutrin i also definitely recommend caffeine also have you seen the videos on the wall of awful? they're really helpful
 it sounds like a copout answer but honestly it varies so much from person to person which is part of why there are so many wellbutrin didn't work for me but i hear it's good for a lot of people celexa was good for me for awhile lexapro tends to be decent across the board
 wanna give a shoutout this morning to my friends zoloft amp; wellbutrin nyou crazy mfurs ium fond of you
 i have a daily pill organizer and i fill it on the weekend so i can be sure to take them each day nni don't know if i forgot to add my wellbutrin all week or just the last day or  but i was definitely feeling the withdrawals today relieved that's why i felt so crappy
 and i are exsmokers and i guarantee we get it i freaking loved smoking i have quit for extended time more times than i'd like to admit wellbutrin helped me once the patch another anyone who says just quit hasn't been addicted to something
 if i take a wellbutrin and then shotgun an energy drink i assume i will transcend both time and depression
 i am sorry to hear you are having significant trouble with depression do you have medical insurance that covers mental illness? if so i recommend taking wellbutrin it's been very effective for covering the down side of schizoaffective disorder bipolar type
 good wellbutrin vibes on this end
 yas i do it daily lmao vyvanse is a stimulant also so i donut get that at all as you can see they both end in ucamphetamineud so theyure very closely related barely any differences i just started wellbutrin like  months ago and take  mg adderall
 i'm a huge believer in tending to one's mental health i go to therapy i take wellbutrin now and used to be on several mood stabilizers and antianxiety meds for years nni mean let's stop acting like some of y'all don't want to just pop pills and nothing else
 psa for my ana girls out there  donut fuck with wellbutrin  sheus fun and friendly but she will stab you in the back (brain)
 i hope none of my exes are telling their new girlfriends that i was crazy i want to be remembered as a really sane bitch a bitch completely in control of her mental faculties because of years of talk therapy and a steady dose of wellbutrin
 i was on wellbutrin as a teenager it adversely affected my stomach tremendously lol
 thank you it was very thought provoking and prescient without terrifying me which is quite the feat since the slightest exposure to msnbc or any news of late sends me for an extra wellbutrin
 wellbutrin withdrawal for the first time and would not recommend
 i found  wellbutrin pills in my pocket which is wat my psych gives me for my adhd currently and and that was less than an hour ago and now they're not in my pocket and i have no idea where they went and that my friends is the definition of adhd
 anybody ever had wellbutrin cause a pain flare??? i tried to start it yesterday and i was in so much pain by the end of the day i could barely move and now today i dont know if i should take it
 me and my friend were facetiming and i brought up that i've had likeno libido lately and her response was and that's on wellbutrin
 hi ium on wellbutrin and celexa too ) wellbutrin has done great things for me and helped ease my anxiety and help me focus more in school i didnut notice many side effects other than appetite curve for a week or so i would def recommend

 ium on lamictal for mood swings but wellbutrin helps out with depression and anxiety for me if you end up trying it i hope it works for you and if it doesnut donut be afraid to ask to be taken off if
 of course the most effective antidepressant iuve tried was lexapro the only real side effect i experienced was motion sickness i was on it for a few years and i would recommend asking your doctor about that if wellbutrin doesnut work out (unless youuve tried lexapro already)
 wellbutrin changed my life i never felt better then my hair starting falling out in clumps this also happened too my mother and my son both of whom saw tremendous life changing results we all had to stop taking it i've never found anything comparable

 hey all so iuve been taking mg of lexapro (took  for about  years and then tried  and didnut like it so now ium back on ) but my libido is uddudceudcudffc and my psychiatrist recommended i try the lowest dosage of wellbutrin instead and slowing wean off my lexapro
 to my understanding they do that because wellbutrin is good for depression but tends to worsen anxiety lexapro is excellent for anxiety but not as much so for depression
 what happens if u stop taking ur mg lexapro and mg wellbutrin all at once asking for a friend
 they don't recommend combining nyquil and wellbutrin which i didn't realize until it was too late  (wellbutrin intensifies the sedative effects of nyquil) i was face down and unable to move and could only mumble before i passed out cold
 the last time i made scrambled eggs was around three years ago i began sobbing uci fuck up everything i touchud ended up on wellbutrin and tried to kill myself so i am wary but i make the best scrambled eggs in the world
 my doc suggested to me last year that i have adhd and put me on wellbutrin which can help with that as well as the depression i am wellknown for seeing amp; connecting patterns very quickly like this i also have a tendency to interrupt others  my brain is firing so quickly
 never ending story meets end of evangellion i will make a generation of children double their dose of wellbutrin
 idk how it would compare but i do love and recommend wellbutrin in general
 yes but wellbutrin has helped tremendously  have you ever tried an snri?
 i stopped in favor of zoloft bc the vyv was making me so so nervous and rude but antianxiety meds have helped me calm down enough to deal with my adhd also ppl recommend wellbutrin but my doc said it makes anxiety worse just a heads up
 i didnut have a history of seizures but had one on wellbutrin  complete with vomiting fun times i ended up stopping it which is too bad because i felt otherwise great on it
 my wellbutrin vs all the pain i see in myself friends n the world
 i'm sure wellbutrin has helped the lives of many people but all it did for me was create a permanent aggravation at least the constant towering rage ended when i stopped taking it
 i stole my dadus wellbutrinuufe0f friends?
 wellbutrin literally increased my suicidal tendencies and made me unbearably angry i took it for maybe a month and had to stop because it just literally tossed me into and even deeper depressive episode ni take citolopram now and i have no issues with it
 good olu wellbutrin found out i was one of the few people who had an allergic reaction to it so i ended up developing dermatographia which is my bodyus way of telling me ucif you take this again ium gonna fucking kill youud also i use a pill sorter too no worries
 well i told my endo once that i'd illicitly tried adhd medication and it helped me organize my thoughts in a way that is extremely rare for me but he just prescribed me wellbutrin as a blanket response to depression and inability focusmotivate
 if it doesnut work naltrexone and wellbutrin was free for me but ium looking forward to saxenda
 for example wellbutrin is not only for treating depressionanxiety it can also help aid in the treatment for adhd depending on the severity and also can aid in weight loss but again it doesnut work for everyone
 i've spoken to another twitter user who is on a low dose of adderall and takes weekends off and sometimes other periods off and i feel like that's the best course of action for me i'm having vision issues on the wellbutrin really badly

 i take meds for that highly recommend wellbutrin

 canut wait to tell my doctor that no amount of wellbutrin is gonna treat the  sense of impending doom iuve had since march udeudd
 observe how it affects you (preferably wa lovedone in the loop bc we don't perceive how we affect others accurately)nif side effects make all other stimulants unavailable? wellbutrin is a godsend but start wthe treatment that studies show are most effective st
 try the stimulant first ) seriously you'll know by the end of the day if it's affecting you amp; how while wellbutrin takes a while to build up in your system the only way to know what stimulant you need amp; at what dosage delivery system amp; stimulant family is to take one amp;
 right now taking mg every morning and it lasts for about  hours depending on sleepfoodbusynessetc not taking any other meds at the moment doctor recommended gradually moving up to mg twice a day potentially adding clonopine at night and wellbutrin if needed
 just had a followup consult on medication with my doctor after starting on mg per day vyvanse in april to great success have noticed it becoming less effective she recommended upping the dose taking x per day and also potentially trying wellbutrin and klonopin for mood
 currently on wellbutrinbupropion i also take otc folate vitamins to enhance it (recommended by a friend) i still have an occasional depression episode every few months but itus much less than i used to i should have started  years ago
 somehow i stumbled upon your thread so ium a psychiatrist that also knows ium here to help raise the vibes for myself and for all the ppl i can help along the way medsupieceu of the puzzle only lexapro amp; wellbutrin are more user friendly stopwatch  some lethargy st weekuddudcd

 my mom once accidentally gave me her adhd meds instead of my wellbutrin so i was off my meds while also taking my own adderall and hers iuve never been more messed up i was so sick full body chills lowkey dissociating and about five panic attacks 0 would not recommend
 depends on the type of antidepressant ndris like wellbutrin no but ssris or snris can have pretty gnarly withdrawal symptoms 
 also going off of antidepressants can send u through really strong withdrawals amp; itus not worth it compared to my other medicationsu withdrawals lexapro has been the worst bc i had a total personality change amp; i didnut even know why wellbutrin amp; fluoxetine are also not great

 me  w mg zmg for about  years zoloft makes you sleepy wellbutrin perks you up but some eople gain weight zoloft can also cause vivid nightmares and loss of sex drive recommend take with food not after food and earlier in the day so you sleep is less affected 
 it gave me awful withdrawals just coming off of the smallest dose  insomnia and nonstop brain zaps i'm a cypd abnormal metabolizer and ended up giving up on ssris entirely  wellbutrin helped a little for awhile but also made my visual snow a lot worse

 i also take a low dose for wellbutrin for anxiety which slightly takes the edge off but hearing how drugs like that plus using caffiene can help a mind focus made me think about my own usage the question remainsnnalso the fact that i took  tweets to make my point ;) end
 wellbutrin was a bad drug for me i had the whole suicide ideation going and luckily a friend just happened to send me a documentary on it while i was going thru it
 so uh my depressed and medicated friendsyour first day on wellbutrin make you feel spacey as hell?
 ium personally on wellbutrin for other reasons but it has helped my adhd immensely with little change in personality a friend of mine is on more classic meds he has def changed some heus more confident and less insecure about small stuff cocky sometimes even
 i feel those are way to strong amp; prescribed so easily for people w depression but wout a chemical imbalancei need those but cant take them cause i take other meds and they react i take buproprion(wellbutrin) now it's not classified as a narcotic amp; does a great jobi recommend
 it depends on which antidepressant you take i take wellbutrin and ium also on adderall and i donut feel like it messes with my creativity if anything it helps me with my productivity which inspires my creativity
 stopping wellbutrin abruptly can result in withdraw symptoms so bad that it can kill you udeuddudeuddudeudd they recommend a  month weaning period bc of how difficult it is to deal with it hopefully they can get you more super soon
 when u go off of certain anti depressants (esp wellbutrin) it feels like your brain is being electrocuted for a second itull happen all day mine got so bad that i couldnut even walk straightthinkdo anything ended up returning to wellbutrin
 hey friends good morning uufe0fni wanted to hop on here and say after  months of trying to get a psychiatrist i finally was able to make an appt talk through issues and get a script for wellbutrin nni made a commitment for  to be healither and glad i stuck it through
 my doc was the who recommended the vitamin d i asked why since i'm out in the sun most of the day and he just said try it i got a giant jar of it and noticed that whenever i felt bad it was when i forgot to take it even while still on wellbutrin
 i have read the casesnand i fail to see why you are so desperate to defend these criminals unless you are their lawyernoh and wellbutrin similar to viagra was originally developed as a heart medication it's a vasodilator anyone taking a tenth of those pills would die
 tw suicidenneven on the highest recommended doses of lexapro and wellbutrin i am at best a blob who doesnut want to kill myself but also canut get out of bed or do anything productive for shit u can imagine what that does for my depression lmao
  makes me upset that wellbutrin helped my quitting smoking i really could use a bad habit right now ahmaudaubrey blacklivesmater biden blm covidufc endracisminamerica georgefloydwasmurdered icantbreatheagain buildbackbetter
 i take xanax and wellbutrin myself i didnut intend it to villanize by any means but see your point completely thank you for the feedback
 the only thing that worked for me was a  month prescription to wellbutrin which friends had recommended it turned me into a listless zombie who spent every night having horrible nightmares but it made me stop caring about smoking good luck to you quitting is the worst
 i have a friend who is having some success with wellbutrin we'll see but she's def decreased her smoking by half so far good luck
 i am  running on postsleepless night delirium and wellbutrin but ium feeling hopeful and healing rn sending all yuall some good vibes so we can share uddudc
 get bupropion wellbutrin i forgot to smoke drink and other stuff  u00a00  or 00 with an rx for a month private  us my refrigerator is  full for visitors  iud rather have a banana milkshake now get some you need a script in uk and us i can not recommend enough
 i kinda got the weird end of some experimental nature talk therapy combined with a  gauge full of pills nni shit you not it was sitting on folding chairs in the woods oneonone with a therapist nnand then pillssssssssnnpaxil celexa wellbutrin lexapro you name it
 lucky wait you werenut on wellbutrin were you bc that tends to suppress appetite
 i was on lexapro for a short period of time and i had everyside effect possible so if wellbutrin doesnut work i wouldnut recommend lexapro i know a few people who were on zoloft but from what iuve seen it turns you into a very quiet person who isnut really in touch with reality
 thatus not bad at all when i went off of wellbutrin i was out of order for  months and ended up having to go back on it hopefully this transition is easier
  the cops fault if they weren't being dickwads you wouldn't have had to protest all weekendnni don't get that anymore i get sad sometimes if i forget my wellbutrin but if i don't take the other stuff i absolutely won't sleep so i need it every night
 wellbutrin  months in nnpros no more severe ups and downs uddudccuddudccmore like uufe0fuufe0fnncons temper is a little more evident if i get irritated a lot nnit okay doe cause not constantly thinking of ending it uddude0c
  itus looking like wellbutrin isnut a stimulant so i wouldnut need to nag my dr to send a new prescription every month if i get it
 allow me to introduce you to my newest old friend wellbutrin
 they still kept me on haldol but for some reason i was feeling emotional overwhelmed and suicidal then my tinnitus started getting to me really bad an i felt extremely suicidal then most of it ended up subsiding but when i met with my psyc he wanted to put me wellbutrin but
 bupropion (wellbutrin) extended release
 i got you girl itus hard to quit smoking have no doubt about that but remember that you can quit others have i have i got nothin on you make a plan and work the plan my friend now i am all excited and focused to help you also talk with your docnp about zyban uddudefudcudffcuufe0fudeudduddudcdudcudffd

 wellbutrin was the best thing thatus ever happened to me only went off it bc my np wouldnut prescribe me adhd meds with wellbutrin bc my blood pressure runs high ended up settling for lexapro so i could go back on adhd meds amp; now ium fat iud rather high blood pressure tbh uddude
 wellbutrin is rough it makes my hubby damn near suicidal when he takes it zoloft ended up being the answer for him maybe your doc can find another type of antidepressant that works better with your brain chemistry?
 paxil (i take the cr formulation)  wellbutrin also had success with zoloft in the past nni'm with you on avoiding extended benzo use if you have  occasional bad anxiety having something on hand for those situations can be helpful
 happy friendship day to prozac amp; wellbutrin
 but ium on the wellbutrin dose recommended for a man twice my weight haha hahaha ha
 i think it commonly does prozac has a tendency to kill the ability to orgasm and wellbutrin has helped
 i had the same experience with wellbutrin but lexapro ended up working pretty well for me too
 wellbutrin is my good friend
 my husband took wellbutrin (antidepressant) to help stop dipping not the indicated use but it works botox was not intended to be use for chronic headaches but we use it amp; it works udeudduduufe0f
 also you know that all medicines are reevaluated every few years and are then perscribed for other ailments than originally intended? wellbutrin can be used for cigarette addiction and depression? and they do this for insurance purposes
 i'm on wellbutrin too now i also take adderall most days and my life has improved by  i was actually completely misdiagnosed when i first went to a psych bc i didn't know how to characterize my adhd symptoms i cannot recommend pursuing treatment enough ()
 lifting weights is also good (or any short explosive exercise) in a related waynnmost antidepressants suck bupropion (wellbutrin) is one of the few that i can generally recommend it is risky if you are predominantlymanic however
 highly recommend wellbutrin less side effects and also zoloft just sucks in general adhkkghj
 the one and only time i took my wellbutrin close to bedtime i had crazy bad nightmares  i do not recommend
 certain classes of antianxiety medications can have a stimulant like effect like bupropion (wellbutrin) depending on how you respond to stimulants it might help you focus better and ease your anxiety or sometimes it can make anxiety worse because it feels ucedgyud
 yeah i likd to reccomend meds like champix or wellbutrin but the needs me to know a lot about you so fir you home managemwnt
 that's awesome yeah i get that ever try wellbutrin? that was the first thing my psychiatrist recommended when i complained about fatigue then again it made me go hulk but that's just meudeudd
 wellbutrin mg extended release gt;gt;gt;gt;gt;gt; 
 wellbutrin doesnut have sexual side effects ium taking it now and ium happy with it ha ha no pun intended
 these are my friendsthis is prozac and wellbutrin medication is part of what i do to help treatcope with my mental illness itus crazy how two small pills are such an enormous part of my life while medication is not a cure all it at least helpstakeyourmeds 
 one of my best friends is a emergency room doctor so i get to cheat at cancer and stuff like finding out i'm prescribed the highest legal dosage of both ssri and whatever we call the other kind like wellbutrin  pretty cool
 not build up a tolerance (i was on x mg concerta on top of wellbutrin and cipralex) eventually the energy wears off nntldr mg of adderall isnut a secret weapon iud recommend concerta bc it doesnut wear off as harshly and abruptly as adderall and maybe mg if youure
 please reach out anytime if u need to talk i am here for u my friend glad u are doing better my prozac has been good but have been tinkering (my dr) w my wellbutrin and it still isnut right yet uufe0fuufe0fuufe0f
 i am on wellbutrin and cipralex as well  i have a contentious relationship with them nin the end i have come to the conclusion that i hate them but not nearly as much as depression so my advice is learn to love what you hate the leastnsicknotweak 
 i'm so sorry you are going through this  when this pandemic hit i was overwhelmed with anxiety my doctor put me on wellbutrin twice daily as and it has worked miraclesngood luck to you my friend
 wellbutrin is my best friend
 good to know i've been on lexapro and a psychiatrist i just spoke with recommended adding wellbutrin temporarily might go ahead and give it try
 it is amazing how the dopamine and endorphins could be literally given a ucbumpud with exercise  i may forget my wellbutrin and not realize but surely i know if i forget my workout  my body hurts more when i donut work out but then again i am olduddude
 ium on effexor and wellbutrin now and itus been the best solution for me but everything works different for different people it depends on what you need it for but make sure you find something that makes you comfortable and feel good )
 i think part of it might be because ium on wellbutrin and concerta and so the wellbutrin stays in my system i definitely can tell certain weekends when i skip the concerta though like if iuve been super busy and want to be able to sleep in my brain just crashes for the day
 is it wellbutrin? bc this sounds like an every weekend thing in my house it is a ride and my manic ass loves it uddude0uddude0
 anyone on wellbutrin that can speak to their experience? not that itus universal but ium stressed abt the recommendation that i go on meds (for ocdanxiety basically)
 the  wellbutrin extended release in me kicked in
 medically they say cigarettes are the hardest drug to quit i had dreams of smoking for years afterwards i did a  day prescription of  it really ends the satisfaction element of act of smoking
 ritalin and adderall both made things worse for me  i ended up asking for wellbutrin since it had research supporting it helping executive functioning around the time when the patent expired  it isn't perfect but it helps better than anything else i've tried
 i wanna make a youtube channel but instead of doing things like makeup and clothes i wanna review meds lmao like uccymbalta ranks last on my list due to body tremors hallucinations night terrors and dry mouth  recommendation wellbutrin on the other hand bangsud
 iull defend wellbutrin until my last dying breath for making me skinny horny and deranged
 people on antidepressants nnwhat kind do you userecommend??nni was on wellbutrin
 might they be moody and willing to try an antidepressant?nni ask 'cause wellbutrin is one of those mood drugs that has the serendipitous side effect of reducing the need to smokenni've had patients report similar urge reduction with librium wouldn't suggest that one long term
 just go get some anti depressants tbh i recommend wellbutrin suppresses my appetite too uddude0c
 anyways todayus breakfast was iced coffee w splenda one cigarette and wellbutrin
 ium like two weeks away from a psychotic breakdown so when you see me awake at am tweeting about pete and pete just mind your business or send me tiff treats and wellbutrin
 how long does it take for a person to start acting insane if for whatever reason they are out of their much needed highest dose of wellbutrin asking for a friend who also happens to be me
 hi the only one thatus ever worked for me is wellbutrin iuve been told if it works for you than to stick with it and for me it did i donut have many side effects at all zoloft i plateaud on but it worked while it could i recommend talking with your doc about all the
 wellbutrin is my best friend but i donut know much about these meds so i canut compare it to anything else
 idek what to talk about tbhnmy wellbutrin isn't working as fast as i hoped they would i just want to sleep and stay asleep i miss uu church because that was the only socialization i had i can't talk to my friends as much anymore and i just want to be happy
 medicine is your friend paxil saved my life wellbutrin got me through the pandemic you have to keep going don't fuck with depression; it's a liar it's lying to you every second you're awake it's a cancer on your soul; be merciless with it
 adhd friends anyone have experience with wellbutrin for adhd management?nnmy psych feels i don't meet the threshold for full diagnosis but acknowledges some relevant symptoms and says it might help
 highly recommend wellbutrin
 this is a good example because most people say effexor is the worst offender for weight gain but wellbutrin is good for weight loss unfortunately we don't have wellbutrin here it's only approved for people trying to quit smoking? not approved for mental health uddude
 i've heard wellbutrin isn't as bad for that in fact on of my friends increased and fathered his first kid
 oof mood med changes can be super hard depending on how your body deals with the change i think when i was starting out with adhd meds my dr put me on wellbutrin  but that med and i don't get along everyone's body and chemical reactions are different
 i was on cipralex and had issues with it so my doctor added wellbutrin when i had shaking hands and amped up anxiety he increased the dose i ended up with a toxic reaction to it i hope it works for you though (my magic combo was latuda and cymbalta)
 wellbutrin was really great for one of my friends and a complete placebo for me itus definitely worth a shot but always be sure to closely monitor yourself for any new symptoms
 an advent calendar but itus a countdown to when my doctor says i can start taking my wellbutrin
 hi wellbutrin is a very common augment for prozac and i was on both for about  years in college happy to chat send me a dm
 i was also going to say thank you to effexor but it sounds funky in the rhythm but seriously thank you effexor and your friends wellbutrin zoloft and prozac who came before you
 letus just see how long i can extend my fast itus almost over but ium not hungry yetnnplus now that ium on wellbutrin my appetite should go away within a week or two
 anyone got experience with wellbutrin? trying to help a friend navigate americaus brokencorrupt mental healthcare system dm if you wana enlighten me xox
 ium currently on the highest dose of wellbutrin xl i still have debilitating lows but whereas i could spend a day in bed before that at least no longer happens was previously on lexapro and legit thought i was losing my mind  had every single side effect
 uy me pasu00f algo similar a finales del au00fo pasado estaba yendo cada dos meses y ella muy cordialmente me sugiriu00f pasarlo a cada quince du00edas ya regresu00e a un ritmo mu00es espaciado (lo cual asocio en parte con haber retomado wellbutrin je) un abrazo ana udcudff
 she recommended it paired with my wellbutrin and she said if i do get more depressed to contact her right away since it can happen if the dosages are increased too quickly but ium hoping it works since my gma and cousin are on it and it works for them
 i take wellbutrin for my adhd def recommend non narcotic non stimulant so you donut have to build a tolerance like that
 recommend wellbutrin if you want to feel nothing at all and be completely numb from any kind of emotional experience uddude0duaufe0f
 i ended up lowering my dose of zoloft raising my dose of wellbutrin and getting a good vibe (not a magic wand they don't do it for me)
 i changed my snri (effexor) to a dri (wellbutrin) since i had time and energy after quitting my job i started going to the gym most daysnbut i think what made the difference was the huge reduction in stress and emotional energy of spending so much time at something i hated
 an upside to the wellbutrin is that i can convince friends to smell it and get some fucking hilarious faces out of that
 it because i eventually found an antidepressant (wellbutrin) that worked for me and helped me become more functional itus not a perfect fix but at least i donut spend every single day thinking about different ways i could kll myself (which happened when i wasnut on meds) x
 yepni take namenda wellbutrin cymbalta xanax and trazedone for sleepingnni used to be on abilfy too
 would also recommend wellbutrin
 some of my successful hot friends have become brand ambassadors and i just want to be sponsored by wellbutrin or pepto
 lol i ended getting wellbutrin last time so very likely
 wellbutrin was great lamictal has helped keep a journal of what you try how much and for how long always ask how long you should wait for something to work before trying something new and schedule an appt for the end of that time at the furthest
 and its more likely to happen with mdma never roll and be on ssris not only that you will be a beastm i usually have to take double or triple the amount of beans my friends taken i do it but do as i say not as i do i'm on wellbutrin
 ucyouure gonna lyca the way you look i guarantee itud u menus werehousennplease pretend this is  ium out of wellbutrin and i need this to do numbers

 they put me on wellbutrin for depression as a teenager and i had nightmares for weeks on end or maybe that was paxil one of them gave me nightmares and the other one made me feel like i was stuck in that new moon montage where months pass
 depends on the meds tbh i started taking wellbutrin when i was having an episode this spring and i started having panic attacks and rly depressive episodes at night so i stopped taking iteverybody has a diff brain tho and it maybe woulduve got better if iud kept with it
 when this wellbutrin kicks in in  weeks itus friendship for you bitches uufe0f
 wellbutrin but it depends on what brain chemicals you need to feel better
 take your meds if you need them people signed me and my best friends wellbutrin and adderall uddude0a 
 i have a friend that crushes and snorts wellbutrin (smoking secession aidantidepressant) you can't trust what the queen of feces says about things and what they are it's pretty easy to crush up some aspirin or spread out some baking soda to look like other shit just sayin'

 can't help wondering if some of the contraception pills could be rebranded amp; remarketed as a treatment for endometriosis with a side effect of reduced ability to become pregnant similar to wellbutrin which could be prescribed as an antidepressant or  smoking cessation
 is that wellbutrin? if so yeah i was on it and it didnut affect me negatively at all however if itus the other pill i think it might be the first weekend i was on it i sat in front of the tv and pretty much drooled for two days
 i did this but with wellbutrin it made a world of difference in terms of my energy levels and tendency to let little bullshit ruin my entire day
 i started with that and ended up responding better to wellbutrin turns out that's what my grandma takes
 hiuklonopin is a benzo amp; addictive many psychiatrist do not prescribe this pill without first trying a fairly long list of other medications if you havenut tried lexipro wellbutrin busprirone and other meds first i wouldnut recommend taking klonopin at all uufe0f
 wellbutrin extended release (xl)  mg uddude0c (replying again bc of my typo)
 my meds were adjusted to add wellbutrin so the big question is while i'm adjusting what should i do with all this new free time that i used to spend sleeping?
 zoloft is really bad for zombie brain and horny is banned brain and apparently wellbutrin solved that for all my friends who switched to it
 i have a few friends who are currently on wellbutrin and they  rave about it to me like its a hidden gem restaurant they found it sounds really promising but obviously i know it effects everyone differently
 i've smoked for  years quit a few times tried the patch gum wellbutrin amp; chantix i'm reading allen carr's easy way to stop smoking (sounds cheesy i know) i would highly recommend it totally different kind of thinking re quitting
 yes paxil in my s was terrible currently on lexapro (generic is escitalopram) amp; wellbutrin my students say theyure grateful i talk about this publicly because it helps end the stigma esp my male identifying students
 your gp can definitely prescribe stuff my sister my husband and i all take wellbutrin which is awesome because it had very little side effects and is extended release i also highly recommend a therapist i think everyone can benefit from an impartial sounding board
 we used wellbutrin to ease the cravings and jitters nnot recommending it just saying
 i've been getting dizzy and lightheaded about  hours after taking my wellbutrin didn't have a dizziness problem all weekend so i assume i'd finally adjusted to my increase apparently i only have these symptoms when i'm at work cute
 let's make mental health healthy to talk about i've had depression for about  years anxiety and adjustment disorder have taken prozac in varying doses wellbutrin a couple times and had much help from family and friends journaling and therapy
 ium on wellbutrin and zoloft for anxiety and it seemed to be helping at the beginning but i think it depends on how severe your anxiety is because as mine has gotten worse it seems as though the medications have stopped helping and became just a nuisance to take
 its known as discontinuation syndromeamp; with ssris such as effexor you actually have to switch to prosac to taper successfully cold turkey gives you the phenomenon of brain shocks(also notice when wellbutrin is cold turkeyed)nbtdt amp; helped friend through the months long taper
 i was put on wellbutrin when i was  after speaking to my gp about (then undiagnosed) ticstouretteus and he decided i was just sad because i didnut have friends as a going through wrong puberty trans kid that drug almost killed me
 i'm on lexapro and wellbutrin as well i know what happens when i don't take my medicationvery bad things happen (i never want to go to the psych ward again)ni'm also on testosterone for my gender dysphorianni'm not on any of those things because i'm lazy
 yes these are the kinds of friends we need hope you get your refill soon guessing stopping wellbutrin coldturkey would feel like absolute shit
 itus different for everyone i specifically asked for an nonssri since that was fucking w my libido wellbutrin is an ndri it improved my sex drive but made other things worse just depends on brain chemistry

 full endorsement for wellbutrin for those who can tolerate it it was also prescribed to me off label as an adhd med and even though i don't think it's as effective as adderall it comes with  less hassle in terms of filling it
 wellbutrin diyorum bende
 my commentary before starting wellbutrin so this comic was inspired by something a friend said to me nmy commentary after starting wellbutrin here's why i think they should greta gerwig to super smash bros
 i take a combo of wellbutrin and zoloft for my anxiety and it has helped me tremendously however my wellbutrin is a higher dosage than zoloft when it was the other way around it caused me to have depressive episodes been on zoloft for i believe  yrs and the combo  yrs
 wellbutrin isnut licenced in the uk except for smoking cessation i checked before my last appointment it makes no sense to me ium on top dose mirtazipine and over top recommended dose venlafaxine and itus still not really working hope youure ok x
 i was on antidepressants for  years and i never had any side effects tbh itus only certain classes of antidepressants like zoloft that wreck your sex drive iud recommend wellbutrin it turned my life around and now ium depression free )
 i've been struggling to draw since starting wellbutrin a couple months ago so actually excited my doctor is recommending i go off it now that i've figured out how to find my old (deleted profile) tiktok videos in my files amp; seeing what i was doing in the spring heck 
 my (ex?) best friend has lost a lot of weight bc she was put on wellbutrin which suppresses appetite etc and im always so so so triggered bc ive had an ed way longer than shes been on it and she used to be bigger than me now shes smaller and it hurts
  cannot recommend wellbutrin enough told my boss that today uddude0 it takes a few weeks to take effect and tbh i only notice when i dont take it the urge to smoke binge food at night went away and my moods became more stablei dont spiral down over small things anymore
 wellbutrin was told by doc that i should double mg because level of depression and angst also my sweet mother died this year and she was a political junkie who wanted to witness trumpus downfall itus all too much but this shit needs to end asap
 perks to wellbutrin i've only eaten two things today skinny legend here i come 
 one time i accidentally took two doses of both my adderall and my wellbutrin (which is also technically a stimulant)nni ended up having to call both poison control amp; my best friend's mom who is a nurse and i still embarrassed myself less than don jr does on a daily basis
 zoloft works really well for me if i forget to take it though i usually end up a teary mess by the end of the day i've also been on it for years tho so idk i think the right dosage is important to find was on that and wellbutrin for a while but the wellbutrin made me ornery af
 anyone have antidepressants recommendations so far i been on zoloft lexapro and wellbutrin
 day two with my new friend wellbutrin woke up with my first alarm showered and got to work on time? weird mentalhealth nntake your meds guys 
 ik heb een jaar wellbutrin geslikt maar van een rustiger hoofd word ik niet perse blijer helaasnnmaar constant aan staan is ook heel vermoeiend met een chronisch ziek lijf uddude0uddude0nndus een middenweg zou gewoon heel prettig zijn
 my best friend loves her wellbutrin for adhddepression and recommends i try it
 it helped me but it's expensive and not comfortable to be on a lot of the time would definitely recommend trying it thoughnnalso look into wellbutrin it's mostly used as depression treatment but it has positive effects on add as well it's what i'm on now
 wellbutrin effexor and lexapro right here i had mental health issues since hs but yrs ago my t diabetes dx caused it to explode my endo recommended my awesome (and also t) therapist who then gave me my psychiatrist's name still a work in progress but so much better
 reaching out to people that i know support me and care about me saved my life fortunately we stopped wellbutrin and found a new combination of medications that's finally making me feel more myself again it was not easy it was the closest i've ever been to ending my life 
 september   finally fighting my way out of wellbutrin withdrawal hell only to find myself alone and unwanted by the one who swore to be with me to the end of ours days all the while being told all is fine and i don't know what you're talking about
 definitely the worst way to handle it but i will say when i mentioned to my current psych that wellbutrin had worked for my depression in the past then asked about adhd she said that wb working tends to happen more with adhd folks that's part of how i got diagnosed
 i just want everyone to know that i learned from my class that my medication is helping me lose weight  so  highly recommend wellbutrin
 t i try to maximize other things first tho swap ssri for wellbutrin or see if they are on something they donut need send them to diabetes educator and reduce insulin npchat
 i haven't thought of wellbutrin i had tried a few antidepsanxiety amp; also focusing on norepinephrine vs ssri's for addmotivation problems for mood gabapentin reeally works for me and helps with nerve pain tremendously (been on it for yrs now)
 i remember when i first started taking wellbutrin about a week in driving back from work i just had the conscious thought i feel goodnnnot quite a week into vyvanse but the whole back end of today was just the conscious thought i feel bad
 i had this the last time my gp upped my wellbutrin i ended up having a panic attack i hope your subsides soon
 that feel when it was a  day weekend and you ran out of wellbutrin and couldnut get a refill because of the  day weekend because you didnut plan ahead uufe0f i feel like ium off my rocker uufe0f
 seriously just this weekend i havenn hit myself in the face repeatedlyn banged my head into the walln scratched myself all overn gone back on wellbutrin?n criednni almost wish i were a real threat to myself instead of not rly bc iud lose what little stability i have in life
 ugh and of course trying to get through to my doc the first day after a long weekend is impossible guess i'll have to wait until tomorrow to get my wellbutrin prescription renewed
 oh yeah wellbutrin that maybe that man justified me and my girlfriend was a bad thing for her and it is a shame she can get a job
 wellbutrin and zoloft are working well together for me the wellbutrin gives me the motivation and focus the zoloft balances out any rage issues that tend to crop up for me i still feel all the feels but i'm not overwhelmed into shutting down it's a decent combo
 i donut know if itus my doubleddose if wellbutrin or the existential introspective weekend epiphany about the ways i repress my emotions and excitement but ium feeling great today
 love the one downside for me was that when i was anxious i never ate so i had lost like  lbs lol went on cipralex gained it back amp; then some ask your doc about wellbutrin if youre concerned about weight gain i hated it sadly but my doc recommended it to combat weight gain
 i do however recommend wellbutrin to people it's worth a try
 honestly was talking abt this wfriend recently; when i was taking wellbutrin (stopped bc side effects were bad) i was so much more neutraltopositive abt my own writing vs selfcriticalamp;selfconscious and itus like oh that is just my brain a continual hurdle
 the famous sister that ended up on ucwellbutrinud with the empty nest syndrome uddudenni donut think we actually see her unless she is someone in the background of the family parties
 regular therapy wellbutrin xanax and good friends
 your rehab girlfriend said she got that wap yeah wellbutrin and prozac uddude
 exercise  i have fought depression since  was  years old  i talk to friends and family a lot  i try to relax with comedic movies and good times  i take wellbutrin and it helps also duloxetine   a hobby helps staying busy helps  remember it is a chemical imbalance
 ritalin extended release was good tho just adderall xr was bad lol but i just donut think i need any stims rn cause ium on wellbutrin which does rlly similar things so ium good
 when someone says ucwhatus the worst that could happen?ud itus this made up of extended release wellbutrin 
 i was so hoping iud be gucci n wouldnut have to cycle thru different meds why tf didnut i just go on wellbutrin like my doctor recommended i hate myself i listen to my moms fuckin dumbass advice just give me a med card ium fine when ium hgh
 wellbutrin is actually nicknamed poor man's cocaine i do not recommend taking it spontaneously when ur not supposed to cuz it can cause mania and psychosis (from experience)
 immensely wild to me that every time a dr has rx'd me an antidepressant they haven't worked but then i read about wellbutrin and was like  yeah i want that one and i was right nndrs are fake send tweet
 wellbutrin for me made me sweat buckets nonstop even with the air conditioning on but it did give me a lot of energy and helped keep me moving through the day depends really on what side effects you might have specifically
 lexapro made me nauseated af for a while but other than that i didn't notice an appreciable difference between them a lot of people say wellbutrin gives you more energy but it doesn't seem to have that effect on me udeudduduufe0f it all depends on the individual though
 between the two wellbutrin is better for its side effect profile if you want to treat depression but is not as effective at treating anxiety if there's an anxiety component i'd recommend lexapro instead
 wellbutrin made me hulk out when i had an anxiety attack i do not recommend but every brain is different
 thanks expressscripts  my pt was failed by lexapro prozac zoloft wellbutrin and effexor and instead of allowing me to try trintellix you're demanding the entire chart be sent detailing each failure over the past  years on a holiday weekend during the pandemic  fu
 my psychiatrist bumped me up to mg of wellbutrin xl and man there are some days i drink coffee and end up literally vibrating with energy nnthe biggest downside is having no appetite so i forget to eat a lot more
 i believe that was one of the ones my boyfriend took he wasn't doing well wit when he was forced to add wellbutrin i'm just glad those days are over for him drs need  consider rather depression is situational or clinical amp; stop wrx'n for pain so often imho at least
 quelquuune ici prend du bupropion (zybanwellbutrin) comme antidu00epresseur?
 depends on med  person finding one that works takes trial and error many donut like first one they try due to ineffectiveness or side effects eg weight sexual issues ucbuzzyud or flulike symptoms on withdrawal etc  prozac or wellbutrin  least problematic for many
 my husband takes cymbalta which is working ok for him he tried wellbutrin once and it was not good for him at all i think lexapro worked for him though so if it didn't for you cymbalta may not either i think a lot of these meds are hit and miss depending on individual bodies
 i was warned about the dangers of wellbutrin withdrawals but not the side effects of dosage increase and mixing it with alcoholulong story short i drank heavily all weekend (havenut drank since mon) then increased my med dosage yesterday amp; today and had a seizure today uddude0
 i started out on zoloft and it didn't really do anything ended up switching to wellbutrin that actually works pretty well
 i've been on wellbutrin mg with celexa  mg and i'm currently on cymbalta mg i tend to mesh better with snri meds as opposed to ssris some ssri meds have messed with me within like  hours of ingestion snri is more if a stimulant some ppl prefer stimulants
 i'm on wellbutrin for anxiety sadly this is brought on by my now homeless pregnant  yr old bipolar daughter it helps a bit but her problems keep getting bigger and her treatment of me keeps getting meaner i have a friend who is dosing and it has helped
 depends on the right balance being numbed out with zoloft the first month was fine bc my mental state was really bad to start with i was able to shut down yet function and catch up on sleep (xanax) wellbutrin was added in to provide balance ive been off them now for a year
 i had a breakdown more or less after the  election went into hysterics at a friendus bday party a few weeks later in a bar have been on wellbutrin almost the whole time since then so
 ive heard another friend tell me they like wellbutrin im gonna talk to my doctor about it i guess i dont know what i need right now and im afraid of trying out like new meds over and over so i really appreciate your input udeuddauddudedudeudd
 i've not taken it myself but have heard good things from friends and the docs at work use it a lot nndon't know if you've tried cymbalta yet but that was the one that finally worked for me in combination with wellbutrin cos of the dopamine boost that has
 i took wellbutrin before and one of the not fun possible side effects is a skin rash that can be super serious for some people i ended getting the rashes and it wasnut fun ( just as a heads up
 reverse sad is usually treated by recommending increasing time in cool dark places and talk therapy (wellbutrin and lights are not usually used for summer sad)

 we discussed changing meds but i like the wellbutrin so we're upping the dosage that and hopefully counseling will help once i get in will start painting again probably this weekend and will start reading again i have a ton of baseball mysteries history  chapter a night

 right now i'm doing weekly therapy with an emdr specialist (if you ever feel like you logically make breakthroughs but can't get your mind to internalize them i highly recommend emdr) and i take pristiq and wellbutrin to address my mood and attention issues

 i take latuda i hear wellbutrin does things to youni hope it all mellows outni know finding the right medication mix can be a hasslenn( the alternative is highfi beats to lose you sanity to and i don't reccomend them )
 but i can tell you that without my anxiety medication (lexapro) i would have nonstop panic attacks and would literally be unable to function my antidepressant (wellbutrin) has also helped me tremendously
 for an extra kick of the all day uci might just die from thisud feeling take extendedrelease wellbutrin
 i love that adderall is trending rn personally i think amp; are both on desoxyn vyvanse dexedrine and  or wellbutrin so basically meth and bathsalts maybe a bit of steroids too? can't wait to see donald loose the election amp; finally go to jail

 hey rave friends did you know if youure on wellbutrin or other anti depress and do molly or other psychedelics youure putting yourself at risk for seizures or even death uddude please be safe and make sure you ask your dr about the risks they are there to help you
 i take wellbutrin (bupropion) and it works reasonably well for me i canut do ssris because they aggravate my gerd and that ends up making me more anxious than with no meds at all
 for sure also lemme know how you like wellbutrin my doc recommended it and i was worried about sex drive and appetite too
 yup if a therapist ever gives you wellbutrin i would recommend you to see if itus better to take something else ium taking lexapro again which iuve been taking since i was  (my mom and dad had fights every night and i would cry myself to sleep)
 sciencemedicine friends why does my wellbutrin smell like eggs? sulphur?
 i was on it for five years and it wasn't until i tried to end my life that i saw a psychiatrist who was furious that i'd been taking wellbutrin for five years without any ssri it might work better in combination with other things but on the whole i can't recommend it
 lexapro mg once every morning alternatively you could go with wellbutrin or latuda depending on which neurotransmitters you believe are causing your problems but my personal favorite is putting fist full piles of baking soda directly inside my asshole hope everything is ok
 literally all i hear from my girlfriends after starting wellbutrin is about the wap that comes along with it uddude0
 i tried zoloft lexapro amp; celexa ium currently on wellbutrin i originally took two a day but iud still have a low point so now ium on mg of the extended release so it releases throughout the day and itus helped so much i hope it works for you uufe0fuufe0f
 team wellbutrin was a good one the therapist who recommended it said it's like a pontoon bridge across a swamp your feet will still get wet sometimes but the alligators can't get you and that was a helpful visual to carry

 i recommend wellbutrin it's brave of you to admit to a mental disorder on twitter go and consult with doctors
 in using wellbutrin to help in two weeks i've gone from a half a pack a day to  per day i'm at mg anything else you recommend to help
 if anyone needs lexapro zoloft wellbutrin trazadone lithium abilify or lamictal send them my way
 it did not work for me at all but i have a good friend that had tried just as many dif meds as me and wellbutrin is what finally worked and helped her and she loves it stick with it for a few weeks before you decide finding the right meds can be very hard best luck to you uaufe0f
 friend ium bored letus take our wellbutrin
 your best friend of  years i think you need to consider wellbutrin nnyou bah so sure we love each other like sisters you know me like few other peoplebut itus not like youure a therapist who specializes in this nnyour best friend is a therapist who specializes in this
 i have friends who swear by wellbutrin so i figure iull give it another swing but i wouldnut be surprised if it does nothing or worse than nothing
 i was on wellbutrin for like a year i had side effects but no therapeutic effects but people with treatment resistant mental illness tend to have quite a list of things like that
 wellbutrin really didn't do much for me but apparently it did allow me to combat intrusive thoughts because the last week without it has been hell i've been trying since yesterday to get my homework done and i'm still here on twitter for why?? send help
 thanks for sharing  you are so right and i can't believe that we still have to discuss this  i go to the doctor and tell my friends that i'm taking lipitor for high cholesterol but it is a stigma to say i went to my therapist and i'm on wellbutrin  there's no difference
 i was on it while taking the maximum dosage of zoloft wellbutrin gave me vivid dreams that oftentimes ended in me kicking and screaming out of my sleep random muscle spasms and l ringing in my left ear i stopped taking it after the last side effect
 you really donutnnif you canut just quit today put in a calendar reminder now for the future date where making the decision to withdraw would make senseudeuddeudcudffdnnfwiw wellbutrin was very helpful to my motivation but gave me the rare hulk smash rage side effect or iud stay on it
 tbh i've been on wellbutrin (mg daily) for about a year now and it's been pretty good there definitely are cons but would recommend trying at least
 today i managed to calm myself down from three irrational fears caused by wellbutrin dosage drops without having to ask my friends ucdo you hate me???ud jebbushpleaseclapgif uddudcudcudffd
 strong endorsement for wellbutrin from dana donnelley good to know good to know 
 is this headache from wellbutrin or from spending hours staring at a screen who can tell 
 gosh that sounds terrible i've been on every med in the book don't have a problem with wellbutrin or lamictal hmmyou feel outside yourself does that mean you feel disconnected to yourself or that you don't feel much emotionwise? it depends on your diagnosis tho
 i took wellbutrin to quit smoking (it worked) felt very content and happy except for the sleepless nights so cut my dosage in half no other issues however a friend was taking it at the same time and became suicidal (ended up in hospital)
 it depends many anti depressants have side effects for the first two to six weeks however if they are something you can't live with change them asap i tried wellbutrin mentally i felt amazing but i was also sweating like i was exercising  which was socially unacceptable
 itus pretty amazing in tiny doses if you find your sweet spot for mental health i find but also i have a few friends who absolutely love wellbutrin and say it has minimal negative side effects
 its not but i can see yours is might i recommend wellbutrin? really helps with the moodiness
 havenut taken zoloft but have taken wellbutrin i didnut have nausea but iud been on ssris before when i started on ssri i got nauseous for the first week after taking it so if being nauseous will give you anxiety that you might throw up i recommend taking it with food
 i have a good friend who's about to start wellbutrin and they've never taken anything for their depression before and are feeling nervous nnif you've been on it will you share a bit about your experience? i'd love to share it with my friend

 hi friends with addadhd if you take medication and adderall didnut work for you what did?nnmy doc has recommended looking into wellbutrin concerta strattera and ritalin
 abandoned by his ego years ago obie (argelys samuel oriach) a yearold queer moves with his therapist mother (azealia banks) to a small town in florida lonely and missing his friends obie is ecstatic to find companionship with a rambunctious little dog he names wellbutrin
 i'm absolutely not a medical doctor and not recommending anything medically but for me personally wellbutrin ended up working perfectly without any side effects that i can observe that medication is often recommended as a great alternative to ssris highly recommend asking doc
 wellbutrin should sponsor me for how often i tell my friends it's the horny ssri
 wait oh because you're taking wellbutrin? same here it's an ndri so they tend to increase libido as well but it depends on the person yeah it doesn't  affect me either if that's what you meant
 my wellbutrin andor prozac friends ily
 i didnut notice much benefit on strattera and a dr told me wellbutrin could help w focus but i didnut notice much from that either stimulants are usually bad for me but low doses or extended release meds taken as needed have helped
 this is super fucking random so ium sorry but i would also like to recommend wellbutrin ) itus street name is uhappy horny and skinnyu like thatus what my doctor literally called it it made me lose hella weight and works really well  i hope you are feeling ok
 k so plan for the day ium gonna feed my pets eat a sandwich purge a sandwich take my wellbutrin amp; xanax go out for a cigarette try to make myself look like ium not a wreck for therapy go downstairs and do some candle magick go upstairs amp; do my hw amp; attend german class
 me on both wellbutrin and lamictal ah yes just like my best friends allison and gaby
 oh fr it gets so tiring tbh one day i was like fuck this what if i pretend to be a narcissist but after the day ended i was like nah i need to be somewhat critical of myself especially as an artist dbt seems like an expensive nightmare wellbutrin can be my savior for now

 sweet i know friends that can't get off switched to wellbutrin because it is covered forever zibane only one session allowed
 wellbutrin i ended up having a horrible allergic reaction where it felt like i had hives on the inside of my body driving me absolutely nuts
 ium just a boy standing in front of my friendus car that i just vomited on because my doctor didnut mention nausea was one of the most common side effects of wellbutrin
 i would not recommend you take wellbutrin while in recovery or honestly after it has a side effect of weight loss which is the last thing any of us need
 my gp gave me a script for wellbutrin which my family historically has bad reactions to amp; told me to try it along with upping my iron turns out my ucdepressionud was anemia again and too much of my opioid painkillers i ended up not needing the wellbutrin and she was fine w it

 whaddup it's worldmentalhealthday and uh i've been on wellbutrin for a couple days now after sinking into a rough depression hole and it at least makes me feel like the metaphorical weight chained to my leg is a bit lighter sending love to anybody else struggling out there lt;
 meds are really tricky i'm pretty sure that not everybody who tries cymbalta or wellbutrin ends up with insomnia but i do think therapy is good to start with it's great that you have a recommendation i've basically had to roll the dice on my therapists but so far so good
 pretty sure i cant take wellbutrin might be able to take lithium depending on inactive ingredients  nnnever tried lithium unless those coin batteries count
 it's not uncommon to switch molecules if the first has unwanted side effects express what you're concerned with and remember you're not locked into your treatment as much as i love wellbutrin i dont recommend it as first line (interactions insomnia very vividscary dreams)
 adding my name to the list of wellbutrin recommendations
 hi lizzieni regret not being able to help your friend but i have a similar inquiryni've been living outside lebanon for almost a year and i need to know about the availability of another antidepressant called buproprion (brandname wellbutrin) in beirutngood luck to us all
 someone just suggested i snort my mg wellbutrin????  ium good man i want new friends
 when i quit for good  yrs ago i did a combination of wellbutrin and nicotine patches never looked back good luck my friend 
 wellbutrin lowers the seizure threshold but it depends on your neurophysiology eg i was able to drink l of barcadi  on wellbutrin which for some people would give them a seizure
 to my friends who take wellbutrin iuve been taking this on and off for years recently started it again and notice that ium clenching my jaw hard  does anyone else have this issue? lol

 fridaymotivation starting my taper off wellbutrin today i have taken this med for too long and really don't know that it helps me at all will find out by month's end wish me luck
 wellbutrin has worked the best for me  i started on prozac but had too many side effects  i think it really depends on how your body reacts  good luck
 either the wellbutrin is working or my frontal lobe finally dropped or i am getting pure serotonin from listening to sky ferreira  and pretending like it is 
 thatus pretty much true about any drug as i said ymmv the pdr for any of this stuff can be scary you have to try them until one works for you venlaxafine is brutal according to my medical friends some folks have done well on wellbutrin while others say it makes them nuts
 when my psychiatrist asks how the wellbutrin is going ium just gonna send her my twitter
 wellbutrin has been a godsend for me  i've been on every antidepressant under the sun and wellbutrin is the only one that gives me energy instead of making me feel like a zombie i hope it works well for you
 have friends that have taken both wellbutrin can make you angery iuve tried it before but i think it would overall have fewer side effects than lexapro ) it is stimulating for sure
 a hot tub with a bath and body works stress relief candle a mix of eucalyptus and lavender salts in the tub and bubble gum reading on my kindle or watching episodes of whatever bubble gum thing ium watching at the time that and wellbutrin the last mths uddude0

 ssris can depending on which drug make tripping impossible you can take  tabs and not feel a thing was my experience on wellbutrin
 it depends on what kind i was on sertraline and that made me feel like i was on d r u g s ium on wellbutrin and abilify and i literally feel not one bit of difference but it has made a drastric improvement on my life by allowing me to wake up at all
 ium sorry it just sux all around wellbutrin and lexapro were no gos for me as well and i reserve xanax for panic attacks honestly legos are a godsend for me i can feel the endorphins release after about  min

 omg ik i dont know you but i honestly love wellbutrin i def would recommend that so good luck

 i started wellbutrin this week strong recommend
 i was on wellbutrin for a bit for depression more than anxiety butu i ended up w the worst hot flashes amp; i wasnut going thru menopause i thought perhaps i was hitting it ridiculously early but then i read the side effects of wellbutrin as soon as i went off it i was fine
 honestly everyoneus different i have been on wellbutrin for years successfully (in combo wother rx) but lexapro was traumatic for me i would recommend talking with family wsimilar diagnoses to see if theyuve tried it itus possible you would respond similarly to certain rx
 ium a neuroscientist and was really interested in taking wellbutrin given all the positive side effects (eg energy) but i ended up being allergic and had terrible hives i had great results with lexapro but the withdrawal was terrible basically felt like the flu
 i have anxdepress granted it is anecdotal but wellbutrin didnut help me ended up actually making me angry and made it hard to get out of rage stintsnnnever tried lexapro ium on sertraline (zoloft) right now and it has been doing me pretty well current world status aside
 the dizzinessay pass depending on how long you've been on it wellbutrin made my anxiety x worse i ended up on paxil for a bit to balance out don't be afraid to ask for another med until you find what works for you
 never tried lexapro but wellbutrin has been a godsend for my mental health i was on zoloft and it helped a little but welbutrin turned my life around
 it really depends on the person i think i haven't had lexapro but i did poorly on wellbutrin  i'm unfortunately struggling to remember my experiences but i think my anxiety decreased while my depression got much worse i'm on generic pristiq now which has worked well ()
 wellbutrin gave me weird side effects it messed with my nerve endings or something ended up on effexor and it worked really well for me
 i take wellbutrin along with lamotrigine i have to be careful as i've found that the wrong dose does make me super anxious and a little dizzy but when i get it right it's the only thing that works well for me i recommend trying if you have a doctor to help you monitor it
 i was on wellbutrin for a while it made my depression exponentially worse i only got off of it because a friend noticed and told me i needed to switch
 wellbutrin was very helpful for years i wish i could still take it i would recommend it as long as you're not at risk to od i did so and i caused a lot of damage
 i took a dna test that recommended wellbutrin it made me feel a tightness in my chest and the doctor said keep going it got worse they sent me to er for ekg then told me to take halves i haven't been back to that doctor soon as i stopped the tightness went away

 my genetic test said i basically am noncompliant chemically with most so i cycle out of well most of them i recommend wellbutrin
 there are actually several nonstimulant options this is the one i think is most often recommended but my dr was also willing to try wellbutrin or clonidine if it didn't work out (i don't even use caffeine anymore bc it makes my heart weird which is why i'm going this route)

 have you thought about taking an ndri like bupropionwellbutrin? you can have an occasional drink w it it's also out of the body faster since it's half life ( out) is  hours; it's  out of body in roughly  days i don't recommend going off and on anything frequently
 stims in general aren't really recommended for adhd with anxiety features from everything i've read wellbutrin and strattera are the common options for that particular combo (stimlike but not stims) nni'm on strattera and it's nice
 for me it depends on the time of day that i drank it i also think it kind of acts as medication for me since ium self diagnosedunmedicated except to the wellbutrin that the np i was seeing gave me for my anxietydepression knowing that i have adhd tendencies

 hard to pick the toughest thing about me but perhaps itus that my nicotine addiction endured thru being maxed out on wellbutrin

 mindfulness techniques are helpful they focus on breathing and not ruminating on negative thoughts and meditation also i recently saw my dr and got anxiety meds wellbutrin and it's helped tremendously good luck
 i took wellbutrin with prozac for about a year and it ended up giving me seizures so now ium on lamictal and prozac i am liking this combo better however i notice the higher the dose of lamictallamotrigine the worse i feel

 i know been there never that many more like  a day i could not quit but i did in the end that was  years ago this month zyban was a huge help good luck

 chantix turned me into a raging psycho and scared me off of trying anything else for some time tried again this year with zyban and it worked amazingly well six months smoke free at the end this month ) nni hope your friend comes around; youure a good person to try to help
 i quit with zyban but i recommend gum or jolly ranchers too
 smokers who use psychotropic drugs for smoking cessation like varenicline (chantix) or bupropion (zyban) should be monitored closely for severy psychotic side effects (depression suicidal tendencies)nsafest and most successful way to quit combustion is through nicotine vaping
 hinnis there an update on zyban availability  is it still likely to be available again from end of nov?nnium currently paying privately for the prescriptionsnnthanks

 consider lowdose naltrexone (it's synergistic with mildmoderate doses of wellbutrin for weightloss see contrave) it blunts the endorphinreward response associated with some compulsive vices plus modifies chronic inflammation bidirectionally associated with obesity
 i had an alcohol dependency and was on  mg of wellbutrin and lamictal combined i couldnut feel anything 
 whereus my friends on wellbutrin ? uddude0uddude0uddude0
 i've been on zoloft and wellbutrin and buspar and they just all suck and have endless side effects
 do you have adhd as well by chance? after this whole pandemic crap my anxiety and adhd went crazy too i ended up switching to vyvanse with buspirone and it's been magic for that calm feeling wellbutrin did help with that stuff as well but wasn't strong enough wcovid anxiety
 goals for n get jacked again aka gym x a week  run most (like xweek min)n bleach all the brown out of my hairn respond to friends iuve neglectedn ween off zoloft hopefully amp; only take wellbutrin n figure out what makes my stomach hurt amp; stop eating it
 i swear by them wellbutrin for the more traditional melancholic deression symptoms  lethargy  etc and an ssri or snri for the depressive ruminating if youure worried about something ucflatteningud you iud recommend wellbutrin it kicks ass and sort of feels like caffeine
 it's like wellbutrin switches off the part of the brain that experiences the pleasurable effects of alcohol so the tendency is to drink more while the rest of your system amp; everyonething in your vicinity is experiencing the deleterious effects of excessive alcohol consumption
 (has anyone taken wellbutrin with zoloft? i just wanted to try a dosage increase but the doctor recommended adding wellbutrin and i am nervous)
 although often considered a childhood issue adhd may effect up to  of the adult population here's how to identify it and find treatment resources    wondering about wellbutrin as opposed to extended release med i on now but i take cymbalta for fibroudeudd
 so i don't post about my mental health issues often but i do have some things i wanted to share i started wellbutrin at the end on nov on top of my lexapron  my hoarding was becoming a problem i was happy but never had the energy for anything let alone people ()
 i wanted to share the list of all the meds i take you may want to talk to your psychiatrist about all these medsnnlexapronwellbutrinnbusparnlamotriginendonepezilnclonidinenoxcarbazepine
 dopamine helps so you could talk to a doctor about wellbutrin itus a dopamine targeted anxiety med i recommend seeing a true psychiatrist and not a gp to discuss i take it and adderall can help but is hard to get prescribed
 wellbutrin is a smoking cession that also helps treat anxiety depression and add highly recommend
 apologies for the screenshots haha i was explaining the testing process to my friend a while back so i figured i'd share what i told them i currently take wellbutrin (bupropion xl  mg) amp; i used to take vyvanse so if you'd like some input on that feel free to ask good luck 
 addendum physical therapy plus wellbutrin but the physical therapy was a new idea and the structure of going was very important to getting unstuck itus really healing to be regarded with someone really analyzing physical issues nurturing
 what strikes me about the schultz is how deliberately it moves (as you point out) and how centered it is on depression as you say schultz like sendak knew how children thinknnnowadays chuck's parents would have the little guy on wellbutrin
 this can usually be fixed once you get on the right medicationnow everyone has different brain chemistry so you must find the right kindni recommend a stronger newer one like cymbalta but if not try paxl or wellbutrin or whatever your doctor recommends 
 if lucyus really a psychiatrist why didnut she write charlie brown a prescription for wellbutrin and then send him on his way? 
 merry christmas udeudduddude0ennpmu00a0ium on the facebook profile of the only one that mattered my most pathetic habit iuve been prescribed wellbutrin pretty much since we broke up i hate days when my thoughts turn to heruit hurts but fits in with my many masochistic tendencies
 i feel both depending on the day wellbutrin made my anxiety worse so now ium on cymbalta udeudd
 joke was on meu i also ended up having to put my shoes on nnthe park was lovely but so many people wearing their masks wrong or not at all had a rageblackout instead of an anxiety attack though  thank you wellbutrin
 thank you for the recommendation i was on wellbutrin for about yrs then had to switch providers went from mg to 0 in a day basically this is not the year to mess with meds like this it was an accident on their part but i paid the consequences
 lots of us were being and saying terrible things but i took a moment to catch my breath and decided to be different i ain't where i wanna be but i'm better therapy helped so does wellbutrin also weed and i blocked a lot of ppl friends included
 youure the best uufe0f a friend contacted me after this thread and suggested i try wellbutrin as itus not an ssri and thus less mindfucking in general iuve heard good things about it from multiple people so ium going to bring that one up to my doctor udeudde
 i recently tried a new med combo that was just wellbutrin and i was mean and grumpy so idk keep that in mind could be a side effect i ended up switching meds
 i did go off wellbutrin once and im sure it was abrupt because that is how i have ended all meds haha but i dont want to figure it out this time
 i couldnut cum on wellbutrin but i did lose a shitload of weight which i immediately gained back  once i went off it 0 do not recommend 
 my  years on wellbutrin before i went insane and realized all it did was give me just enough sweet sweet dopamine to pretend to deal with my thenundiagnosed bipolar ii and adhd the okayest of times ) 
 wellbutrin got me back on my high school sleep schedule accepting applications for new online australian friends
 storytime wellbutrin made me have a breakdown and run away in the middle of the night so my bf and his friends had to hunt me down in the streets of wburg uddude0 
 so to the wives paroxetine and wellbutrin for being the only reason i havenut offed myself since i lost meap and all my friends 
 i had the same reaction when i started taking it my doctor ended switching me to wellbutrin it's and ndri instead of a ssri
 ium gonna start slipping wellbutrin into all of my friends drinks
 if you end up getting the wrong adhd medication prescribed it can be more detrimental than how you felt before; say for example instead cozaar you were given wellbutrin and it didn't play well with your other medications or had other unintended sideeffects 
 also did my doc really recommend putting me on an ssri when ium already taking wellbutrin twice daily? yuall really fucking hate mental illness so much that healthcare professionals are willing to poison me instead of actually treating me lol fuck the united states
 i used to overspend on impulse purchases all the time until i started taking wellbutrin 
 there is a huge amount of overlap in different symptoms for ocdadhdbpdautism neurodivergence is a full spectrum of brain chemistry did i send you my adhd resources?? from my understanding wellbutrin helps take care of symptoms not necessarily the actual disorder
 i canut be on ssrius but from friends i know that paxil was particularly brutal on weight and withdrawal and another friend struggled with both on prozac wellbutrin and zoloft are the two i always hear lean toward weight loss over gain
 itus gr the fact that ium taking less of my wellbutrin and it didnut even change to the extended release version is literally making me feel like ium insane
 lmao okay update reply made me realize i a) have an entire bottle of wellbutrin remaining and b) have been taking my wellbutrin as usual all weekendnn(my care support worker refills my med container i simply swallow the pills so it gets confusing)
 oh damn i forgot i could just like ask for that even though i literally gave a friend some wellbutrin a few weeks ago i think i will hit up the friend who i gave wellbutrin for wellbutrin but will hit u up if that doesn't work
 have experienced more ableism and transphobia this weekend than i've experienced in the last like month (or year if you don't count doctor bullshit) it hurts so bad and i'm out of wellbutrin for now wish i had the right drugs to just hibernate for a while

 wellbutrin actually ends up working as the solo medication for some adhd folks with depression as it works on the dopamine pathway that a lot of stimulants also use
 any friends w bpd that have an opinion on wellbutrin?
 sounds like wellbutrin i believe that is the name friend was trying to quit smoking after several nights of crazy dreams he pulled the patch off and stuck it on his wife's head to give her a show udeuddudeudd
 wellbutrin helped a lot ium a lucky person who also more or less lost the taste for them over the years maybe thatus from the wellbutrin i may have one every now and then drinking w friends but i never finish it or want another
 yeah it felt less like discrete hot flashes and more like i just tended to run warmer in general? but i was on wellbutrin for years and it was a problem i've heard it anecdotally from other people too
 ima be real ium not ok i havenut been ok in a long time itus gotten to the point where i canut live a normal life ium taking mg of wellbutrin every day and itus still not enough for me to smile to all my friends ium so sorry iuve been so distant i miss you all so much but i
 hey there i found your research related to aphantasia i've had it all my life ended up in therapy and on wellbutrin ever since my dose was upped i've slowly gained the ability to see images in my head i see others online with similar experiences interesting

 iuve only been on strattera for  weeks so she wants me to try to ride it out until my appointment at the end of the month to see if there is any change there is also the possibility of just upping my existing dose of wellbutrin if this doesnut work  so weull see
 consider lowdose naltrexone (it's synergistic with mildmoderate doses of wellbutrin for weightloss see contrave) it blunts the endorphinreward response associated with some compulsive vices plus modifies chronic inflammation bidirectionally associated with obesity
 i tried to get adderall from my psych and she immediately recommend wellbutrin instead fucking prick
 ium kinda surprised they added a medication instead of considering a lower doseextended release of wellbutrin bc it can cause anxiety or at least make it worse
 it's been a crap year generally i know i'm ending by trying to get my wellbutrin dosage increased

 update on wellbutrininduced tinnitusni did end up taking a second dose two days after the first because the ringing had mostly subsided just to make sure it really was the medication ringing was back within couple of hours loud enough to interfere with my hearing of speech
 ium actually on buspar for anxiety but i have noticed a difference in my anxiety levels just the last two days when i added in wellbutrin i know some people have bad side effects but itus really worked so far and i highly recommend giving it a shot if you can
 hello friends if any of u have taken wellbutrin please lmk how your experience has been
 wellbutrin made me manic so i assume that i could make you anxious in the same process depending on if you already have naturally high anxiety levels
 however everyone is different depending on how severe their adhd is as well as what other things they have that affect their neurological functions it also probably depends on your medication  i take wellbutrin which i love because it helps my adhd depression amp; anxiety but
 all my best friends are on wellbutrin now we are unstoppable
 iuve reversed my stance on subbing to friends ofs due to recent changes (taking hrny juice every morning aka wellbutrin) which of you sluts is on there other than samm

 just heard back from my sister she recommended xyzal she said cycling allergy meds is the only way to get relief because each individual med only works for a finite  amount of time
 don't use the one with the sudafed it dries your sinuses and mouth out like crazy i've also had great luck with xyzal at night start off with half a pill though it has a tendency to make you hungover the next day
 i have started this year using xyzal and it does help  was a recommendation from a friend of mine who is an ent
 for allergies my mother recommends xyzal definitely good since it only needs to be taken once a day and provides  hr relief
 clarification i get decent results from the flonase style sprays but anything in pill form is zonk city zyrtec xyzal claratin etc older i get the more i just depend on a comical amount of nose blowing

 happy roseannebarr day i blame my sociopathic tendencies on zyrtec
 mold ragweed pollen and dust can cause symptoms like runny nose itchy eyes and stuffiness during the spring and summer months we recommend these low or nonsedating antihistamines to help alleviate your symptoms claritin allegra and zyrtec
 and sending up a prayer that maybe just maybe the benadryl and zyrtec will do its job but knowing it probably wonut which means it could mean another trip to the doctor for temporary relief
 upping the zyrtec dose will not helpit's a  hr time release once a day tablet tabs a day no better than onetry benadryl  mg  times a day may increase to mg depending on your weightnote it will cause drowsiness but should work
 i usually recommend antihistamines without decongestant because if the antihistamine is working you donut need the other component also brand name never needed

 you gotta become friends with your pharmacist in big towns the one at target knows my name always helps me when i need new meds like my mixture of mucinex and xyzal lol

 i'm so sorry jessie that sounds pretty miserable with the hives if it is happening consistently i reccomend xyzal for a few days

 i had issues with allergies (hives) and sinuses i take a generic zyrtec every day and it has helped tremendously

 i began taking zyrtec when it was a prescription drug after doctors couldn't find a way to stop my mysterious hives from forming i also had typical allergies so it was the perfect double solution when my doctors thought i outgrew my hives they recommended i try weaning off
 claritin and adhd meds play nice with each other allegra is also alrightnni do not recommend zyrtec or benadryl

 multiple people in my family have cat allergies so bad that their throats close up and their eyes puff; one used zyrtec before visiting a cat cafu00e and kept an inhaler on hand just in case and aside from feeling a bit itchy she was fine might depend on severity of allergies? uddudc
 i would recommend a daily antihistamine zyrtec has a generic cetirizine mg once daily is the adult dose tons of water and idk maybe just wear a mask like in japan? oo;
 yes i did ended up with the same error maybe itus on the end of smartsource shame
 been there no fun i take a daily zyrteci must have a dust allergy or somethingbut when i've forgotten it a couple days i've noticed itching i just pretend it didn't happen do not want to deal
 ugh fucking hives thankfully i don't deal with them too much mostly on my forearmshands if i play rough with a friend's dog i probably take zyrtec a few times a week tho for eyessinus stuff
 my boyfriend is so sweet we went to church today and before we left he said ucwait lemme check the pollenud ium gonna grab you some zyrtec just in case uddudedudduded
 zyrtec is the brand name here for cetirizine (tends to be a little more effective than loratadine ime but iuve not tried desloratadine) pair with an h antihistamine (ranitidine or famotidine) to make the h more effective nnhives suck good luck friend
 trevor's mom was recommending xyzal and said they have a  pills for  on their website right now she said it makes you sleepy but you dont wake up drowsy
 hello in clinical studies  of those who took xyzal experienced drowsiness while that's a small percentage it is recommended that while taking xyzal you avoid alcohol sedatives and tranquilizers to minimize the risk of unwanted drowsiness
 took a xyzal otc allergy med and nasal spray and im still symptomatic this pollen ascended from hell
 the wendy's baconator xxx xyzal  part   a buddy in benson
 had to upgrade my allergy meds claritin isn't cutting it anymore gonna try generic xyzal because it claims to cover more reasons my head feels like a balloon what do y'all recommend? this is just run of the mill spring allergies 
 xyzal has worked best for me zyrtec works for most people (i'm allergic) nnif your eyes are itchy and dry zaditor eye drops are a godsend systane is good if just drynnalso a daily spoonful of local honey is helpful as it will contain natural pollens in the area
 i got three times a week i could go one or two but i go three so itull be faster idk if this will help you but they also put me on a medication called xyzal and that has helped tremendously and is otc at least here i had been taking claritan and zyrtec but they stopped workin
 don't use those cus those have steroids bilastine or xyzal are safe for liver  can use everyday etc xyzal is recommended for nighttime though trust me lol i took it everyday for almost  years
 flonase works for my boyfriend and xyzal works well for my sister and dad
 guys really i can't recommend xyzal enough i don't have allergies but it works wonders for my chronic hives (benadryl does nothing) so i imagine it works well for seasonal allergies too 
 i recommend zyrtec and xyzal if you're able to take those and can afford them
 how much cold medicine must i take before i get some relief? how many days must i endure this crud  and still try to be creative?? oi nnyquil dayquil xyzal zyrtec ndripdrip achoo overit 
 i have this itus frustrating to treat but there are options you can take antihistamines like xyzal or zyrtec twice a day which has helped me tremendously also talk to your doctor about a prescription for singulair
 itus funny because zyrtec does nothing to me but has the same effect as you on a few of my girlfriends  medication can effect people differently  take it easy you have two beautiful children tend too 
 i'm fine on zyrtec but benadryl and i are not friends nbenadryl makes me an anxious manic wreck
 my allergist recommends zyrtec generics i purchased a bottle of  pills at costco for 00 or so
 they recommend you take zyrtec at night for drowsiness
 it depends on the person i take claritin because zyrtec turns me into an absolute zombie
 for this reason my daughterus pediatrician recommended that she takes zyrtec only at night
 yes i canut take zyrtec for the same reason claritin and allegra donut do anything so i ended up getting allergy shots
 i take zyrtec at night (every night to keep all the allergies at bay) my dr recommended that since itus an antihistamine claritin and allegra by day zyrtec by night apparently
 zyrtec can make you sleepy at recommended doses if you want real nondrowsy you should try allegra
 yesss chrissy girl let me tell you this happened to me last weekend took a zyrtec midmorning thought i roofied myself i slept for  hours couldn't keep my eyes open felt like i chugged about  benadryl 
 zyrtec is known to make people drowsy it depends on the person because i can take it at all times and be fine but a lot of people canut
 try allegra or claritin (or their generics) zyrtec tends to be the most sedating of all the ucnondrowsyud antihistamines
 in college i once had a zyrtec bender blacked out for four days and woke up in a tub of ice in oaxaca with a note pinned to my chest telling me one of my kidneys had been removed be careful
 where you want me to send this airlift of zyrtec to?notmybabyjesus 
 zyrtec is your friend henny uddudcaudeudda0
 zyrtec is what my allergist recommends
 answered told my boyfriend he could probably take a zyrtec even though he took claritin  or so h healthtap 
 benadryl lowers seizure thresholds for a lot of epileptics like me which most doctors donut know i take zyrtec i find itus the best for skin reactions like hives itching welts etc which tend to be how my strange things manifest there was a time where my husband thoughtu
 generics are fine zyrtec or claritin are fine amp; cheap i personally have better luck with zyrtec iud start that a week ahead of your trip and carry some flonase in case other doesnut cut it or some really bad allergy sufferers have recommended these 
 no argument it depends on the year zyrtec works better last year claritin this year not sure why (
 also if you're weird too and enjoy spending a lovely saturday afternoon reading court filings here's that for this case  nnthat and the pollen level outdoors in the a today requires more zyrtec than cvs is ever gonna sell to  person
 it was so weird because yesterday i was feeling super itchy everywhere so i ended up taking a benadryl at night and slept way too long   hours actually oops so now im not sure if i can take a zyrtec but it literally did fuck all for my runny nose
 this pollen out here bouta make me pop  zyrtec and end it all smh uddude
 fwiw my allergist told me allegra tends to work betteris stronger than claritin and zyrtec tends to work betteris stronger than claritin (xyxal is basically zyrtec; same active ingredient) iuve found that to be true
 zyrtec is our best friend
 i love when you can actually see the pollen in the air hey zyrtec my old friend 
 zyrtec is my best friend rnuufe0f
 shit man same here try zyrtec and flonase or the vapor rub stick for the nose i hate having allergies the pollen is the worse you end up looking high or looked like your cried your eyes out loll
 ium on the readytocarryaninsaneamountofzyrtecandtissuesinmypurse end of that scale
 i mean all allergy meds are antihistamines and they tend to do that ucsupposedlyud zyrtec is more drowsy compared to claritin itus just up to personal preference tbh u00af_(uc)_u00af
 you are definitely not an old lady my allergies certainly have gotten worse and more of them as i got older zyrtec and flonase are your friends
 i tried claritinloratadine but it barely helped me i'm usually taking cetirizine (sold as zyrtec over there?) i feel like it works better but also tends to make me drowsy but it works very well when i take it before going to bed i'm basically allergyfree on cetirizine
 do they even make zyrtec strong enough for the pollen weure getting this year? asking for a friend
 zyrtec is my best friend
 welcome to the club add dogs cats and most mold and that was my testing i tried the drops but ended up stopping i just use nose spray and zyrtec now

 itus allergy season folks and if youure like me i recommend checking the expiration date on your zyrtec benadryl and flonase because apparently all of mine expired  years ago so i had to restock
 zyrtec is better than claritin imo but it causes drowsiness which is a bummer i also recommend flonase or nasacort which really help too
 i developed allergies at the end of a long cold when i was in my late s would go from head to chest affecting my voice i live in socal and take something everyday  have for years flonase amp; zyrtec are my jam
 do they make iv drips of zyrtec? asking for a friend ium the friend 
 any recommendations for allergy medicine? claritin doesnut really work for me and zyrtec and benadryl still make me extremely drowsy the next day even if i take it at night uddude
 so apparently if you just eat a shitload of zyrtec when you're sick it doesn't in fact make you feel better the next day i can't breathe pls send help
 if you really donut mind spending zyrtec d is also really good
 anybody have any recommendations for medicine to help with my allergies? zyrtec isnut working udeuddudcudffduduufe0f
 i developed this about  years ago zyrtec seems to help but i've since developed a dependence on the drug (insanityinducing itchiness when i miss a single dose) which apparently is not uncommon so i'd avoid taking it if you can

 whoa score zyrtec allergy relief  count for only 0 at cvs (reg ) starting  spend  on zyrtec products and earn a  extracare buck at cvs we have a high value coupon (this expires on  so 
 zyrtec works well if you take it daily if that doesn't work i'd recommend taking allegra in tandem with zyrtec should both of those fail then i'd recommend taking some form of sudafed (pseudoephedrine) during the day but for some people that makes them drowsy
 an incredible ep of thegoldbergs and schooled and seeing your zyrtec commercial this is a perfect night wendi you truly are the queen
 did you see wendi's zyrtec commercial?
 benadryl donut work zyrtec donut work claritin donut work any recommendations???
 whew chile zyrtec is about to become my best friend 
 have you tried coricidin  or zyrtec? claritin tends to make me loose sleep
 load up on the zyrtec my friend
 xyzal has worked best for me zyrtec works for most people (i'm allergic) nnif your eyes are itchy and dry zaditor eye drops are a godsend systane is good if just drynnalso a daily spoonful of local honey is helpful as it will contain natural pollens in the area
 a friend of mine has to give zyrtec to her little dog for his allergies it seems to help just like with people
 happy first day of spring hereus to my good friends zyrtec sudafed and flonase donut know how ium gunna make it through spring without you uddude0
 i got three times a week i could go one or two but i go three so itull be faster idk if this will help you but they also put me on a medication called xyzal and that has helped tremendously and is otc at least here i had been taking claritan and zyrtec but they stopped workin
 pollen some show obvious symptoms of sneezing and red eyes but many more endure labored breathing or stuffy head a feeling something isn't quite right fortunately for traffic benadryl downers and ephedrine uppers giving way to neutral cetirizine (zyrtec eg)
 the zyrtec amp; benadryl agenda
 zyrtec has always helped me in the past with my horrendous spring time allergies it may take a couple days to really kick in though
 zyrtec amp; sudafed are your friends (and mine too uddude) 
 poor baby nnsilver lining the dish frames her sweet face beautifullyudeuddnnon serious notewould benadryl or zyrtec help w itching? or wash area w mix of ho amp; apple cider vinegar (if no broken skin) a friend does the latter w his dog to remove irritants amp; it helps ask vet?
 i wish i had a good solution for the drainage that has my little guy up half the night coughing benadryl works for a short time zyrtec at night and singulair in the morning werenut helping at all and he was on those for weeks on end
 friend i am the same way with zyrtec spring is here lol
 and last week the allergist told me to take  zyrtec a day and see what happened because he swears my allergies ucarenut badud ium lbs  zyrtec ium not a medical expert but i know that  we arenut sending our best people 
 it is zyrtec season friends
 i too have a tendency to boost my daily zyrtec with a benadryl or two depending how wretched my allergies are being so far it's worked fine for me (i can breathe it's a miracle) and i haven't lost any functionality
 itus that time of the year zyrtec my old friend welcome back
 start on flonase takes a while  work but great when it kicks in  meanwhile alternate allegra mornings w zyrtec nights (or viceversa) my allergy dr recommended this regimennnfigure out what it is to  me cedar starts in dec so i start flonase in early dec
 now i donut have actual parties often but when i do my friends follow me to my back room to pop some zyrtec and puff puff pass my flonase
 oh no call the doc and see if they can recommend something can he take something like zyrtec? i have strange allergies (screwy autoimmune stuff) and often have to take it works great on itch if doc says ok
 me too many people recommend zyrtec my car was yellow this morning from all the tree pollen have to wash car daily too 
 chris was making fun of me the other day cause at any given moment iuve got ibuprofen zyrtec pepcid tums uti meds naloxone lactaid triple antibiotic ointment and cortizone on me cause i am the mom friend
 i use my best friends every morning nasacort and are my jam during pollen season
 yeah benadryl is for allergies but it can make u sleepy everyone responds differently to different things zyrtec has always worked best for me claritin does well but i find it has to build up in ur system for a few days before it works i'd recommend zyrtec hour personally
 dear fellow seasonal allergy sufferers anyone have any recommendations for eye drops? i can manage the sniffles and sneezing with zyrtecclaritin but my eyes are the worst part and nothing seems to help what drops have worked for you?
 on the brink of death if you fwm send zyrtec and claritin
 she's good friends with my buddies nasacort claritin and zyrtec their names may make them sound foreign and exotic but they're really just basic locals
 anything that blooms for the next few weeks will not be your friend  get some zyrtec or claritin and take it daily for the next few weeks
 i send you all my zyrtec wishes

 my zyrtec is barely keeping up with my allergies and i can feel a breakout coming up on my chin with two days worth of airshow photo ops this weekend uddudeuddudeuddude
 ok u just made this awkward try again in a few years i will just send  lol
 do you? i havenut yet but i been taking zyrtec since the end of january to prepare for the pollen season
 i had my mom buy me zyrtec earlier so ium gonna try it out a lot of peephole recommended allegra to me too
 oh no oh no oh no pnw also i had to add flonase to my zyrtec but not be able to use zyrtec gah maybe allegra? thatus what the pharmacist recommended to my husband hope you find something that works and doesnut give you panic attacks
 i also have panic attacks from zyrtec it sucks it worked great for years i switched to claritin (the generic from target) and take one or two a day depending on how bad the allergy season is (i can't use nasal sprays because of my asthma)
 oh man  my girlfriend had a similar problem and it turns out a lot of people get anxiety on zyrtec looks like you'll need to consult an allergy specialist  i'm sorry  good luck
 uufe0f iuve got two dogs that have me dependent on singulair (asthma and allergies) and zyrtec and i still canut breathe half the time but cats make my eyeballs feel like i have rocks inside them
 oh boy i ran out of zyrtec and after spending two and a half hours outside and another hour inside a dusty warehouse my allergies are kicking my ass and giving me a headache
 walks into friendus apartment and takes a cat in each arm as she deposits a zyrtec directly into my mouth
 zyrtec helps me a lot one pill a day if i don't take it i end up with the old stand by benadryl benny helps but i can't function afterwards makes me so sleepy i'm staggering
 zyrtec is my preferred allergy med of choice and if you have to be in an allergy heavy place for long iud seriously recommend getting allergy testing and shots i got them as a teen and they really do work as a kid my allergies were horrible and now theyure barely there
 claritin d used to work for me but when the meth wars made it a hassle to buy i switched to something without the sudafed component combined they work better that either does alonennsomehow i ended up with zyrtec recently because of stories zyrtec was addictive i stopped
 i recommend zyrtec and xyzal if you're able to take those and can afford them
 living in mississippi i have a passionate hatred for meth heads theyuve ruined my ability to purchase zyrtec d or anything with sudafed in it over the counter so something that should be as simple as going to cvs requires me to spend  for a doctor visit

 yep lifelong allergy sufferer here and that exactly what it's like other telltale signs are itchy ears eyes and throat i recommend zyrtec over benadryl or claratin tho works way better and won't make you drowsy
 now on flonase cingular zyrtec and sudafed on an as needed basis  recommend you try a saline spray or neti pot may be able to get off affrin

 i take a zyrtec everyday and have for years it depends on your body i used to take claritan but it stopped working for me
 my corgi does this bullshit and ended with a secondary infection we dealt with but going forward the vet said you can put them on an otc like zyrtec
 pollen is so bad already in the south people are thinking their cars have been vandalized help us send zyrtec 
 no amount of dayquil or zyrtec d has stopped the pressure in my head since last night and i deadass feel like ium ascending on a plane bc of how plugged my ears areuddudeuddudeuddudeuddudeuddude
 can it be spring already am tired of this cold amp; the never ending flu symptoms bring on the pollen already atleast there is zyrtec amp; allegra udeuddudcudffeuduufe0f
 i have this itus frustrating to treat but there are options you can take antihistamines like xyzal or zyrtec twice a day which has helped me tremendously also talk to your doctor about a prescription for singulair
 i take zyrtec every day so i donut think i have the histamines available to develop the alphagal allergy i have a friend in tallahassee who had to go to the emergency room after eating a steak so i read up on it tick bites never even itch me chiggers though
 gonna do this with my old washed friends and get smacked on kirkland signature generic zyrtec 
 i'll send you zyrtec lol
 binge watching your videos i see you suffer from allergies like i do i had been taking allegra for years but it didnut always work for me i finally went to an allergist and he recommended otc zyrtec in the pm and nasal spray flonase in the am life saver uufe0f
 and the d in zyrtecd stands for decongestant not ucdrowsyud (no matter what anyone on here says uddude0)  your friendly online pharmacist
 the xyzal at least is letting me breathe through my nose again so thanks to everyone who recommended that one
 what if kamikaze recommends huge xyzal in 
 a many patients do notice that certain medications seem to be less effective with time but this is usually an indication that the allergic symptoms are worsening claritin tends to be less potent than the other oral antihistamines such as allegra zyrtec and xyzal nschats
 xyzal is what ium taking now i see the best results with it i donut sneeze as much i hate nasal sprays and my ent recommends it but i canut do it udeudd
 go pick up some xyzal friend
 at my annual allergy checkup recently my allergy dr and friend switched me over to a new med  the 'next generation' for zrytec is what she is calling this otc med i am anxious 
 current regimen isnxyzal at nightndaily sinugator treatment (like an electric netty pot)nflonasenopcona allergy eye dropsnlemon lavender amp; peppermint essential oilsn benadryl every  hoursndaily allergy drops for immunotherapy that seems to not be workingnalbuterol as needed
 you try xyzal? you can get a  day supply on their website and just pay shipping it works for me when everything stopped working for me my body tends to get immune to shit after i keep using it
 yeah that's why i tried it i've been on zyrtec forever if you go to xyzal's website they'll send you  pills for  and then give you a  coupon
 i've been sick this respiratory thing going around i also have allergies highly recommend xyzal makes you tired in beginning but then no side effects take at night
 thank you i spend a fortune every year on zyrtec since i moved to lagos and my eyes and throat won't stop itching nose running permanent headache etc meanwhile the allergies almost disappeared when i lived in dc which is allergy central in the us lagos is the worst

 zyrtec benedryl and tissue are my new best friends
 hmm right now i have my little jack on a rotating schedule of singulair flonase amp; cvs liquid allergy medicine  any suggestions?  this article recommends zyrtec   does it work fast? 
 ditto to this zyrtec recommendation and if itus really bad then at night benadryl too they both work on different receptors so taking both wonut be a problem but benadryl causes drowsiness so i recommend it only during the night i hope it helps

 i'z heard from doggy pals (their people) that the pharmacy shelf recommendations are without a prescription nbenadryl (diphenhydramine) nzyrtec (cetirizine) and nclaritin (loratadine)  n though they might be called something else in uk
 i donut get allergies but my friend says zyrtec is amazing
 zyrtec and emergenc are your friends
 yes i'm so dumb i need an app to remind me when to take even basic medicine also i just swapped out the zyrtec for zyrtecd i hope to be able to breathe out of my nose by the end of may ugh

 oh no i wish i had a puppy to send you picsuddudeduddudedudduded in the mean time my future baby sends you some love uddude and dont forget the zyrtec 
 a friend told me you can't take more than one zyrtec per day but in one day you can take  zyrtec  claritin  allegra and  benydryl (at night obvi) my friend does that every day during allergy season so that my friend doesn't claw her own eyes out
 zyrtec didnut work on me i do claritin amp; flonase daily and zaditor (eye drops) twice a day or more if itus horrendously bad iull add a benadryl as necessary an occasional neti pot rinse can help regain control
 zyrtec is one of the more sedating of the newer generation of antihistamines you can get a very groggy feeling i would not take more than recommended dose what are your symptoms?
 is it the kind with pseudoephedrine (zyrtec d) in it? or the extended releasehr? too much pse can cause increasedit regular heartbeat
 i use zyrtec but i canut use nasal sprays because i have a knee jerk reaction and pull back and i end up spraying it in my eyes lol
 yes and theyure somehow not working today udduded i was just telling my friends that i hope that doesnut mean i need to switch to a new one zyrtec has been my saving grace the last few years
 if it doesnut get better and it ends up just being allergies try zyrtec d i have horrible allergies so i take it all year round but a normal allergy pill is like mg where these are mg and have a decongestant
 my allergies geeking like i wonut pop  benadryls amp; a zyrtec amp; end it all
 just tell her boyfriend to take some benadryl non drowsy until you guys can find a for sure place or take zyrtec

 lmao now you gotta start taking allergy medicine daily udeuddudcudffduduufe0f i recommend zyrtec
 i felt this struggle last week yes let me just spend  on a bottle of target brand zyrtec so i donut die itus fine ium fine
 zyrtec is usually my goto antihistamines my doctors recommend nowadays the nasal stuff (nasacort flonase) since they're more preventative vs the antihistamines which are reactive
 prescribed prednisone told to stop antibiotic because it's doing nothing for mold exposure a different antihistamine because zyrtec i can't keep my eyes open with and a chiropractic recommendation to get ribs 
 i have two flonase and zyrtec but i wouldnut say weure friends
 dampness in the air like fog tends to cause the particles of pollen to fall to the ground and not be a problem until things dry out just a thought here in the tampa area the bad pollen is done oaks pines and cedarcypress are finished pollinating no more zyrtec this year
 am allergy attack still going strong  box of kleenex down no end in sightmight be the swollen watery eyes though am dying send rescue boat with zyrtec and n00ds nnside note the kleenex with lotion and vicks is the best kleenex
 bitchi feel my allergies sneaking up like i donut think so bitch like try me and iull end our shit with a whole bottle of zyrtec bitch
 me and my barrel of generic zyrtec send our regards uddudeb
 a combo of flonase and zyrtec both are  hours but i take one at night and one in the morning and it seems to help keep it under control as a preventative if i still have an episode then i take two benadryl and end up a zombie haha
 zyrtec for the congestion and flonase for your nasal i literally have the worst allergies and asthma all the time so if i donut keep it under control iull end up kicking my own ass
 my daughter usually alternates btwn claritin zyrtec and flonase she tends to build up an immunity to claritin over time
 yeah that's why i tried it i've been on zyrtec forever if you go to xyzal's website they'll send you  pills for  and then give you a  coupon
 i need to just  you for everything this was totally  it saline helped the post nasal and i completely forgot that youud recommended zyrtec to me around this time last year gahhh maybe i should check in w you weekly for reminders about momeverything uddude0uddudcuddude

 same for me this morning lol im gone take a xyzal closer to the end of work
 i recommend a cetrizine like zyrtec (i use kaiser's generic)  takes a frw days to start working but works better than benadryl and claritin
 there isnut enough zyrtec in the world to knock these allergies out please send help please
 zyrtec from your friendly neighborhood allergic to eruthang ana
 i am also allergic to cats and thus never had one i also moved in with someone who had them ( at the time) zyrtec is my friend and now i am an unqualified cat person go figure
 i have extremely severe allergies u i recommend you switch to allegrad and flonase benadryl always makes me feel terrible and zyrtec just doesnut work as well also if you have vickus on hand put some below your nose until the meds kick in
 i recommend you to take these medications and you will be fine nparacetamol mg every hrs nzyrtec once daily noxymetazoline nasel spray if you have congestion ndextromethorphan if you have dry cough nall meds are over the counter
  advil bottle filled w zyrtec benadryl pepto tablets tylenol pm (not sure which is which)n oz of did i send that   years agonlots of tissuesnnotes from therapy (on napkin)naquaphor
 i'm having a full panel of allergy tests on monday so i cannot take any antihistamines for a week nnmy eyes are constantly watering my sinuses are in full revolt and low grade hives are breaking out on my lower back nnin less than  hours wo zyrtecnnsend comforting memes
 so sorry to hear that ( i have taken take zyrtec everyday because ium allergic to my babies too we have three cats and one big golden retriever here is a pix i took this weekend with my great grandson n sabrina 
 uddude0 benadryl puts me to night night for real tho my allergies are horrible i take zyrtec flonase and zaditor daily and this still happens every so often this flare up in never ending uddudedudcudfc
 you're welcome glad you got in wdermatologistnnan oral h blocker zyrtec (nonsedative) or benadryl (sedative) can be of limited help wthe itching toonnsending healing thoughts your way
 someone give the a steelers some zyrtec because they're allergic to the endzone
 do you have trouble sleeping or sciatic nerve painuuunread what our tlc sister says uddudcudcudffeuddudcudcudffeuddudcudcudffetoday i no longer take benadryl to go to sleep and i sleep like a baby no allergy medications (i used to take claritin zyrtec or benadryl depending on the season) who's next? inbox me 
 that's tragictry allergy medsi have cats my friend is allergic but he takes a zyrtec and he's good
 just zyrtec but it's always been enough for me in the past my allergies have never been that bad even taking care of her cats for hours at a time is fine but spending the night there i think is what pushed it over the top
 iuve tried them all and i do tend to go generic the brand version is zyrtec but itus  hr and itus the only one that works for me besides benadryl (which also knocks me out)
 zyrtec is your best friend in summer here
 i had a lot of luck with zyrtec too but my allergist switched me off ium supposed to see him for an end of season report but the season never ended
 i have never had allergies amp; all of a sudden this year zyrtec d is about to be my best frienduddude0
 i need my voice back udduded iuve been taking shots of dayquil amp; zyrtec all weekend
 im tired of being allergic to habuk its gotten worse since i got back here im depending on zyrtec on a day to day to basis help im drowsy all the time
 i took a zyrtec lastnight cause i had a fake allergic reaction but baby lemme tell u i was high af after  blunts like i wouldnut even recommend myself to drive dat high uddude0uddude0uddude0
 i was supervisor by myself today in my zone and i sent my boss a snap of me taking a zyrtec because ium sicknnhe pulled me in his office at the end of my shift and calmly addressed i canut be ucpoppin a mollyud before my shiftnnmy boss thought i took illegal drugs on the clock
 hi i recommend reading the article in the linkdiscusses the better options available over the counter nnit comes down to what the medicine is being used for itching? long lasting non sedating antihistamines such as zyrtecallegra much more effective with less side effectsuddudcd
 benadryl melatonin cbd oil valerian root  zyrtec and something called eden those are all over the counter (i've been battling insomnia for a long time) by prescription i recommend ambien not sure the long term effects but not sleeping is the worstni hope you sleep
 good to know for food allergies in dogs i know my pup has the constant itching symptom from both food allergies and environmental that iuve used both benadryl amp; zyrtec for by recommendation of my vet dogallergies doghealth foodallergy dogsoftwitter 
 i struggled with that every year a steady dose of zyrtec was the only thing that helped a little best of luck my friend
 you know it's a bad allergy day when you pick up your cat and immediately need to you are my best friend right now
 i take cetirizine (generic zyrtec) daily for my cat allergies because i adore my two boys; so worth it i was able to get a prescription for it so i only pay like  for three months worth ucudcudffb highly recommend it gets the job done for me amp; doesnut make me at all drowsy
 zyrtec is my best friend
 i take flonase and zyrtec daily for cat allergies so theyure unfortunately ineffective when i get hit with a cold udduded but the tradeoff is worth it if i can live with adorable fluffy friends without sneezing all the time
 but cruisen is at least cleanernni'm gonna dose her nwblend of baby zyrtecnamp; anti inflammatory tincturento combat the itchouch from the ant amp; mosquito bites she already gotnnot to mention mennnow just to catch her again aha nthe porch is lockednnscratch scratchnshudder
 got tired of spending a ton on zyrtec or similar and found a generic at 0 per pill frugal tips 
 lol idk how you knew i shook back but i take zyrtec or dayquil depend on how bad it is
 that ium going to lose him soon  heus been really stuff the past few months amp; ive been treating him w zyrtec like the vet recommended  ium really hoping that one of my nagging feelings keeping me from going to nh for a marathon isnut because of him leaving me udduded
 i'm doing the zyrtec in the morning flonase at night neven with the cold snap the allergens are hereni have a dog amp;  catsnswifferismybestfriend
 i'm allergic esp to cats kids have  and foster kittens i continually wash my hands when there and take a zyrtec and benadryl when i spend extra time in house works fine
 without zyrtec spend the entire day sneezing and snifflingnwith zyrtec nose is so dry that it bleeds and hurts to breathe throughnni use my turn signals i say please and thank you iuve never been to a country music festival i uddudcf donut uddudcfdeserve uddudcf this uddudcf
 currently dying udeuddnium that rare percentage of people whose allergies act up like crazy during the beginning of winter season uddude i hate itttt send help yuall or some zyrtec
 my doctor reccomended solution to my constant allergy problems was zyrtec daily so i wouldn't be fucking surprised bullshit they didn't tell you to try sooner though
 just took a zyrtec so i may end up needing bail money later
 i recommend zyrtec
 apart from accidentally roofieing myself with zyrtec my weekend was awesome
 very few people know that the song crazy train is about a zyrtec bender
 i've had nonstop allergies for like a month now pls send zyrtec and an inhaler pls
 i've been this way since tuesday hopefully i'm on the mend zyrtec and claritin but let me tell you get the puffs plus lotion kleenex now and start the vaseline on the nose and around the lips mine are so raw and swollen from all the blowing
 i recommend zyrtec its an anti histaminic zinc as a daily thing to take also helps with the allergies also afrinotrivin for your nose if your nose is fucked i've been living with cats for  years now and i've had allergies ever since also try to make contact limited
 uddudea i thought that was happening to me earlier when my dog got very sick on vet recommended zyrtec he fell over while vomiting and laid there he's much better now but  he's almost  soni'm so very sorry for you it hurts so bad i know only time helps uddudc
 they should sell zyrtec in vending machines
 i need to send my grammy for zyrtec because this place got me itching and it will be worse when tafari gets here udeuddudcudffduduufe0fudeuddudcudffduduufe0fudeuddudcudffduduufe0f
 looks like some of the wrs in tonights thursdaynightfootball  are allergic to catching the football opportunity for endorsements findersfee
 itus so cool how my entire life revolves around my allergies to the point where i am rendered completely unable to function without that sweet sweet zyrtecd

 i had my physical towards the end of that year told the doc and he says just take a zyrtec every day ok sure nnso i do that for several years thank you costco for the year supply for   
 zyrtec is my friend
 let me help you already what if i promised to send you chips but then like oops some zyrtec also accidentally made its way into the box
 my parents lab use to have bad allergies when they lived in the desert their vet actually recommended to give one zyrtec in the mornings with her other supplements it helped her she scratched less often and didn't bite at her skin as much
 it is a little pricey but if you go on the website they'll send you some to try for free so you can see if it works for you before you commit i think the cvs generic version runs like  for a months supply

 my allergies decided hello time to die so like friendly reminder that if you are having allergy symptoms those are not those symptoms you're not dying ilu take some zyrtec stay home wash your hands spring says you're a bitch
 same but it also depends on what type of allergies you have cause if itus mainly sinus problems then try flonase zyrtec amp; claritin are only good for my indoor allergies singulair is the only pill that really worked overall but it was prescribed
 ium boutta take  zyrtec and end it all
 i need to stop being cheap i donut went to  different dollar stores to find some zyrtec because i donut want to spend uddudeb 
 zyrtec is my best friend this time of year but mine would still be going nuts at the sight of that right there lol
 just bought picked up some zyrtec d and i think this is the most exciting thing that happened this weekend
 zyrtec is not cutting the histamine response i am getting in my looking balls aside from enucleation or benadryl how do i end this suffering
 oh i feel i have to take two zyrtec a day just to minimize the sneezing it at least takes the itching away too i'd say if you can stand it for a little while longer i would wait i went to the clinic last week for something and ended up sick for three days
 bendedryl is great  all but zyrtec saves lives
 this weekend i am n getting outside (loaded up on zyrtec) n planting my window boxes and plantersn ni might do some painting and grill on the back deck needed this small rest for sure 
 my allergy friends be sure to have yourneye dropsnnasal spraynallergy pills (claritin zyrtec allegra benadryl etc) nsinus severe medicationnnall on hand to avoid having to go to your doctornnif you need an inhaler refill or steroids call your doc for a refill

 final for now my breathing is steadying as the zyrtec works itself out of my system  hours later my friends and family are all worried for themselves for others for everyone this is real flattenthecurve covid_
 i never really had allergies until a couple years ago now zyrtec and i are really good friendsudeudd
 i am spending so much time outside and slept with windows open i'm just throwing down zyrtec spraying nasacort and drinking a lot of tea with honey
 never have i ever had such bad seasonal allergies i was outside for  minutes today and my eyes were so swollen this after taking flonase and zyrtec when is yellow season going to end?
 zyrtec or flonase my doctor told me that itus best to take the zyrtec at night since itus  hours it has time to settle in your system and does a better job at defending
 i've had similar symptoms to you massive headaches etc no fever though f most but that's norlam with congestion zyrtec helped me and then i stopped eating all sugar and carbs and it helped me tremendously seems like i just had sinus problem get well
 yes and i found when spending extended time in beautiful memphis that a daily squeeze of flonase did the trick along w the occasional zyrtec during extra pollen and bloomy days udcudf turns out that works in nyc during cherry blossom season too as you can imagine a sneeze here ucuddude0
 plus my allergies are wrecking me and it terrifies me because iull randomly cough and i think itus the end uddude0 thank god for zyrtec poppin them babies daily uddude0
 is it smart to drink on zyrtec and benadryl? udeudd asking for a friend
 zyrtec pendant  jours
 recommendation generic zyrtec from costco   for  pills i take them year round and no more allergy problems
 thank you my good friend yeah some aspirin zyrtec and lots of water did the trick as i worked to get my mind off it here's to a great weekend ahead but question is this tiger king worth watching? it has piqued my interest netflix
 thanks nnyeah i'm not even going outside amp; it has hit hopeful the zyrtec will be built up by end of the weekend amp; i'll feel back to  feeling better after a nap atleast lots of naps aheadnni hate pollen
 send help the zyrtec is running low 
 ium telling you zyrtec is a god send once it gets in your system
 nothing like the prospect of i can't tell the difference between my allergies and a deadly pandemic flu to get me to be really vigilant about taking my zyrtecu00ae and flonaseu00ae each morning as recommended (well their generic equivalents)
 pap smear  not gonna happen unless they send me a diy kit ium quite covered (even on my eyelids amp; in my privates) in a crazy itchy rash after getting scratched by a bush while hiking on tuesday and iull od on benadryl amp; zyrtec before i set one toe in an urgent care center
 i saw the tweet people joking about allergies and the reply was ucthrow him a zyrtecud im uddudedudduded that pill is my bestfriend i can relate
 give him some zyrtec and send his way
 if you have zyrtec the dosage is  tablet  kg keep an eye on the swelling if near the nose as it can block the airway generally if there's swelling on the side of the face it tends to be a reaction (bee sting) or possibly a dental abscess depends how it feels to the touch
 our dog had this a few times vet reckoned it was a bee or other insect and the swelling went down with some zyrtec  but it's a big shock to see your little friend like that uufe0f
 i recommend zyrtec
 i highly recommend zyrtec d one in the am and one at night it saves me during spring and fall you have to get it at the pharmacy but it works so well
 turns out my prescribed allergy med cocktail was giving me a heavy chest and dry cough now today zyrtec amp; friends
 can confirm you should get a dog if you have allergies i recommend a cocker or a poodle or zyrtec uddudcuufe0f 
 yeah time to move to the big boys i take allegra and claritin in the am and benadryl  zyrtec at night ymmv on which ones make you tired but thatus what iuve figured out for me ium not recommending you go that hardcore but i would definitely try zyrtec next
 the albuterol zyrtec and singulair are my best friends this time of year also asthma is why my wife and i are being extra cautious with the kids staying home to prevent bringing in covid
 me af zyrtec is my friend
 this has been the last week of my life nnwakeupnscratchy throat nbig cough to clear thingsnblow nosendeep breathnzyrtec ngood to go
 if itus allergies i recommend allergy pills like zyrtec if not try blowing your nose or taking a hot showerbath because the fumes help clear sinuses
 i definitely get sore throats from allergies if you aren't already taking daily zyrtec i definitely recommend it to rule out allergy symptoms when figuring out if you are sick either way i hope you both feel better soon
 allegra and claritin might as well be sugar pills for me zyrtec works okay but xyzal is so much better xyzal has some bonkers side effects though so i recommend it but keep an eye out it gave jason such bizarre dreams he stopped taking it but i donut sneeze at all on it
 you run the risk of causing drowsiness with the loratadine if you took mg you may want to consider switching antihistamines to cetirizine(zyrtec) or fexofenadine (allegra)ndepending on the nature if your symptoms adding a nasal spray like fluticasone me be worth trying
 ah the joy of feeling guilty for spending most of what little money i had left on zyrtec because north florida is pollen hell right now but that leaves me with about  to my name udeuddudeuddudeuddudeuddudeudduddudedudduded
 have the vets tried zyrtec? my vet just recommended a small dose for my cat who has been having breathing problems but with all the coronavirus shoppers cleaning out the stores i haven't been able to findtry the zyrtec yet nwishing you the best in these hard timesuddudc
 lol maybe i didn't phrase this correctly i meant how do i get zyrtec d without going outside i don't want to face the crowds of target i'm gonna try walgreens first but sometimes they don't have zyrtec d which is why i usually end up at target
 i felt fine until i sat up then felt my sinus headacheni get sinus infections around this time of year so i try to keep up with taking allergy meds ni switch btw claritin and zyrtec depending on allergen levels zyrtec for highsevere days but it makes me loopy
 yep zyrtec and flonaise are my friends
 absolutely this  my pharmacist said that cetirizine(zyrtec) amp; loratadine (claratin) r similar in the way they work after a while taking  they can become less effective so he recommended swapping between the  every  months or so it definitely helped 
 zyrtec is my friend
 spring has sprung send zyrtec 
 zyrtec is my friend
 my doctor friends seem to think itus just for the nasal and allergies but a friend did tell me his dad nearly passed away and finally some doctors got him on zyrtec d  i hope minds open about what you and i are talking about 
 my weekend all american snacks zyrtecrepeat
 silly allergies suck flonase and zyrtec are your friends hope you feel ok
 hey how about you waive your instore only policy for allergy medicine restrictions so i can get my zyrtec d via drive thru instead of having to drag a toddler in with me endangering us both?
 i feel it my allergies are horrible and temp shifts get me on zyrtec and have the humidifier going but my anxiety sends me into tail spin
 i only started dealing with this a few years ago so ium still trying to figure it out smh i started taking a zyrtec before bed this past weekend
 zyrtec is your friend
 i was just thinking about this because i have severe allergies all year around so i take a zyrtec every night for years and recently it just goes away mid day and i tried my friends costco brand and i felt like a whole new person i think itus tolerance levels forsure
 once again otc sudafed is widely known to raise bp much more recommended to use otc claritin or otc zyrtec fewer side effects
 zyrtec is my friend until it wears off
 mucinex is good but you to dry up the congestion and shut off the inflammation in your sinuses if not accompanied by feversevere sinus pain this sounds like allergic rhinitis i recommend cetirizine(zyrtec)  mg daily fluticasone(flonase)  spray each nostril daily 
 you just described seasonal allergies iud recommend zyrtec 
 just a friendly reminder itus okay to go outside n also a friendly reminder to my seasonal allergy peeps start taking your zyrtec somehow itus march
 i also had that feeling at times i tried zyrtec liquid for kids since it was recommended to me for sleeping
 bihhh let me go spend that  on the zyrtec udeudd
 i need to call my doctor to refill my zyrtec prescription seasonal allergies tend to fuck up a hot girl summer
 definitely try antihistamine  my doc recommended zyrtec x day i had these hives a week ago probably stress but who knowsthe z pill settled everything fast you can develop allergies any time  even to cats maybe get checked you can still have cats shots pills make ok

 if you live in texas pollen count has been high for the past xdays if your having sinus pressure cough runny nose and sore throat for up to a week recommendations are flonase singulair and zyrtec off brand medications will be fine and cheaper too
 if you have a stuffy nose and congestion you should be taking a zyrtec d benadryl is for a runny sneezy nose if you take it for a stuffy nose you may end up with a sore throat at least that is my experience hope you are feeling better soon sometimes chewing minty gum helps

 girl xyzal hereus pretty pictures of me during some of my outbreaks uddude0 take  xyzal every  hours and it will help immensely (you can actually take up to  in  hours if needed) my doctor also recommends biofreeze for immediate itchburn relief but i havenut tried 
 hi paul in clinical studies  of those who took xyzal experienced drowsiness while that's a small percentage it is recommended that while taking xyzal you avoid alcohol sedatives and tranquilizers to minimize the risk of unwanted drowsiness
 i take one pill of xyzal at night it knocks me tf out but i wake up with a little bit of allergies it is literally a god send
 i have chronic idiopathic urticaria and no known triggers   head to toe for over a year now the only thing that helps is xyzal highly recommend taking a pill my specialist says itus the best drug on the market for hives you can also combine with benadryl safely
 need a good allergy medicine?? try xyzal ucufe0f tell a friend 
 yeah i'd recommend seeing if they would  though if zyrtec works good for you xyzal is another otc that is similar to it but is supposed to be less likely to cause drowziness

 me allergic to perfumes sitting in my lavender vanilla downy laundry  zyrtec in still sneezing 
 they tend to alternate on various frequences so its hard to know where they hit the next time a lot of the sympthomes are allergy related and i've found that mg of zyrtec(antihistamine) kills the worst effects of many of their attacks

 i take allertec from costco onein the morning relieves all kinds of symptoms it is generic zyrtec at about  th the cost between for  pills works wonders been using daily now for about  years doctors donut like to recommendwould put them out of business 
 allergies especially if it's been nice then rainy they're horrible stuffiness congestion sneezing and runny noses zyrtec is my recommendation and extra vitamin c hope you feel better soon 
 allergies are the worst the pollen count here has been high for like ever nowudeuddso ready for some relief i'm with your mom wouldn't make it without my zyrtec and flonaseuddude0(not too big on eye drops though) sending love and peace to you 
 this leads to the question of how many lines do you have? and are they from bolivia?nnthough this time of year mine is a heady blend of benedryl and zyrtec
 i do this too yet when ppl need a pepcid benadryl ibuprofen tylenol or zyrtec i got it and they tend to take whatever i hand them no questions asked
 i tend to like zyrtec a little more less drowsiness but yes ben is nice too lol nnwould you look at that mother nature is taking back her territories a marmot huh cute i mean i think they're cute but i don't think i've seen one in person lol
 even within an org every brand makes money a different way nnzyrtec had  gross margins but was seasonal with two humps pollen and ragweed sell thru or see returns end of season nnlisterine had  margins no seasonality but was all about routines
 girl same zyrtec is my best friend uddude0uddude0

 also remember that allergy meds like zyrtec amp; claritin are intended to be taken regularly over a period of time in order to most effectively relieve allergy symptoms ucudcudffcucudcudffcucudcudffc
 that is a bummer iuve been ok so far though i have tree pollen allergy normally i have to take zyrtec from midapril through the end of may but havenut needed it yet ium sure that will change soon
 i feel ya on the allergies  iuve been on generic zyrtec fo r so long i fear it has stopped working for me or the allergens are on crack this year one of the two  not good at this time because the post nasal drip sends me into coughing fits that goes over like a lead balloon
 zyrtec histal benadryl i hate  bendadryl though cuz it knocks me tf out 
 iuve been taking zyrtec every day for about a month now for my allergies and still suffer from congestion  and sinus headaches daily due to the current pollen count today a friend gave me a turmeric shot from nekter and within  minutes my congestion was gone  hr no painudeuddf
 when i was working as a pharmacist intern and counseling patients you usually recommend starting with claritin first since itus the least drowsy of them and if that doesnut work you go up to the next for me as an example allegra works best and zyrtec causes me some drowsiness)
 your bloodbrain barrier (hence the drowsiness you experience) other antihistamines are zyrtec gt; allegra gt; claritin (when i say strong i mean the drowsiness effect btw not how effective although i will note that depending on your body chemistry some work better than others 
 basta kasama ko lang friend ko si zyrtec lumalaban pa din po uddude0 hahaha
 ahh iud highly recommend not doing that for hivesthose meds are for gastric issues like idegestion and acid reflux they are antihistamines for the gastric system for allergies from strongest to weakest tablets benedryl gt; zyrtec gt;  allegra gt; claritin
 thank you gil yep iuve got plenty of zyrtecuddudeauddudcahave a great weekend as welluddude00
 thankful for all the love amp; concern from friends amp; family for my youngest nnhis pediatrician thinks its his body's reaction to a virus amp; not hives  for now zyrtec is keeping it at bay
 after having it recommended last year that we put my wife's cat on the same zyrtec medication she's on guess it's only natural that my cat should now be prescribed the same pepcid i use anyone else shopping at the same pharmacy as their cats?
 well they recommended the nasal spray flonase and that really didnut work so then they recommended the nasal rinse and zyrtec
 lol please send me some zyrtec 
 benadryl will make you sleepy my ent dr recommended zyrtec and flonase sensimist allergy relief also keep your dog bathed they carry allergins
 it said tear i torenit said bend i bentnit said tear again i tore againnhow did i still get outsmarted by a zyrtec package anyway? 
 zyrtec is my friend
 try allegra my allergist recommended it to me when i zyrtec wasnut helping my allergies enough and really think it works a lot better(at least for me) also for the eyes iuve had luck with the systane zatidor eye drops
 when i had just a cough my doc recommended that i try zyrtec allergy med and it helped apparently there are also thousands of people suffering from allergy this year who have never had it also the medicine has a calming effect
 had terrible allergies growing up in middle school i opted for one of those mfs over a zyrtec so iud look more banged up and then theyud send me home uddude0
 another dick head covid  patient coming in to the er  because his allergies are bothering him gtfoh endangering others for stupidity  get a fuckin zyrtec amp; go to sleep
 could be seasonal allergy i developed it for the first time in my late s took a while to figure it out cough off and on is my only noticeable symptom doc recommended zyrtec  flonase  it works
 there are some i can not take zyrtec is out of the question i become stupid drugged but it won't knock me out depending on the severity of the reaction benadryl will knock me out or i will be awake and very alert
 i have indoor and outdoor allergies grain and milk allergieszyrtec is my friend
 a weighted blanket thermometer  lb of raw cashews an electric pencil sharpener yet another adult highend coloring book zyrtec shelf stable oat milk and probiotics they're really good kind

 zyrtec is my best friend uddude0 fuck allergies man
 always found zyrtec more helpful but can be sedating in bout  allegra is even better ) donut need the brand name costco brand is just as good ent attending also told me that sometimes one stops working and you swap to another for a bit and then you can go back
 caution on zyrtec when i stopped taking it at the end of allergy season i had an itch all over that made me nuts took me weeks to taper off of it i googled it very common i'd wake up itching  it was significant
 started my day with a tiny hit of the devils lettuce an iced coffee half an adderal and a zyrtec me sending out estimates all morning

 real question if zyrtec and xyzalgt; allegra then why the sudden influx of all these docsallergists recommendingprescribing allegra i had a pt refuse to try any other because ucmy doc said allegra is superiorud i was just recommending they try any other nd gen
 my kid got allergy testing while on claritin the histamine control literally showed it was useless currently he's on zyrtec i'm on hr allegra in am zyrtec in pm and a second allegra on a bad day as recommended by my allergist (plus sublingual immunotherapy)
 i was trying to get through this allergy season without using allergy medicine but surrendered to it zyrtec for the win
 my vet said itus hard to know whatus causing sammieus said it could be pollen grass food my carpet etc but the steroid shot had bad side effects so i tried the zyrtec based off another vets recommendation itus helping
 whoever recommended allegra you win so much better than zyrtec uddudcdudcudffcthanks
 my pharmacist friend told me claritin is like taking placebo first line and most effective is the nasal steroids i do that but not as compliant as i should be and also switched to zyrtec at her suggestion and doing much better
 zyrtec xdy depending on the local pollen count  flonase in the morning nhepa air filter for the bedroom  run it all day with the door closed in case the noise is too much at night  nthis is the only claritin product that worked for men
 claritin does nothing for meiuve been doing zyrtec daily sudafed and tylenol sinus severe prn if i end up with a headache
 that being said the flare ups are the real deal  weeks ago i ended up taking mg of benadryl in one afternoon just to stop sneezingnwhat i do nownmg zyrtec qam another mg later if pollen is super awful nflonase  puffs each side at first for a week nbenadryl prn
 zyrtec at night and claritin in the morning help i also have to take singulair and azelastine nose spray but for otc thatus my recommendation for something that helps with bad allergy season plus a good humidifier
 i ususally take zyrtec and then a nose spray but i missed yesterday and had to spend sometime outside today and now im dying lmfaoo im dumb
 i usually take  pills of zyrtec or claritin depending on how bad my allergies are i don't take over  i think u can over dose on those lol
 i also recommend zyrtec claritin does nothing for me udduded

 if you believe it is allergies give him half a zyrtec once a day  others have suggested ear mites  i have no idea if that's right nor do i have any recommendation
 free stock tip invest in zyrtec allegra and claritin nnwith allergy season coming up (once this latewinter ends) these will be selling like hotcakesnn(i'm not a financial advisor)
 the allergycast app now does personalized recommendations great app if you have allergies 
 ceterizine is the brand generic name of zyrtecncvs usually has brand generic allergy meds ( the price)nfexafenedrine(allegra) is pretty strong claritin is weak but passablenflonase works but it's spendyni stocked upndm me if your stores are out out and i'll see what can do
 look at the active ingredient on the bottle and get the store brand version zyrtec is cetirizine fexofenidine and is another non drowsy antihistamine people tend to ignore the store brands so there are generally more of them around
 if you have flex spending order from the flex spending store target and costco both have it and will ship it i use zyrtec knock off from both places depending on where ium at when i need more
 zyrtec and flonase have been my best friends for the past few weeks uddude0
 i alternate zyrtec and claritin daily every  days and also pop a benadryl or two at the end of a workday (or middle of the day on the weekend) if they are really bad i find it helps if i miss a zyrtecclaritin day its miserable hopefully this rain will slow it down
 good idea your house is surrounded by dirt and in the middle of the city and you may be allergic to the trees in the park i recommend taking zyrtec each day
 just took a fake zyrtec so ima suddenly end up sleep out of nowhere im quite sure
 take it for a few days until you feel back to normal then take an allergy pill and flonase daily my dr recommended zyrtec or allegra claritin works too but i have to take  to get it to work right
 depends what's his deal with cats? allergies that zyrtec can't manage?
 i get that when my allergies are so bad they start to back up fluid into my ear massive doses of all the allergy meds controls it benadryl at night zyrtec and flonase daily and sudafed or mucinex in daytime depending on if my nose feels dry or drippy or both
 zyrtecus my best friend rn
 a flaw i have is that i take my daily medicine in the morning and itus so routine that i donut remember if i took it so i end up taking all of them again and before i know it ium on mg of adderall and mg of zyrtec
 iuve been doing this for a about a week now and switched to the walgreens brand of zyrtec as advised by my best friend ium feeling so much better

 a friend recommended baby benadryl today i don't have any (adult or baby) in the house  just zyrtec pills which i would not give to the cat but i may venture out to the store if the sneezing continues

 my sister a retired allergist recommends generic zyrtec over generic claritin for nonsedating antihistamine
 i would definitely recommend some bedtime benadryl (generic diphenhydramine really cheap everyone should have this on hand for emergencies)and maybe a zyrtec (cetirizine  walmart sells these in boxes of  for 0) in the morning
 every brand has the ucdud version lol i would recommend zyrtec
 zyrtec and zyrtecd are very effective and the reason i know that is because my allergies in california are really bad and i feel horrendous if i skip a day

 cw advice in case it's wanted  feel free to ignore if notnnif the nausea is linked to mcas and you can tolerate benadryl may be worth trying that? it tends to be more potent than zyrtec and dramamine is literally that  a stimulant
 you need all the drugs allegra zyrtec flonase just blend them all in a ginger orange smoothie
 trash the claratin and get you some zyrtec back that up with a blow of flonase when needed sinus rinse at the end of the day you'll be a new man with no time left to enjoy the rest of the day
 on a pharmacist recommendationnnzyrtec  afrin for  days then drop both and switch to flonase for duration of allergy seasonnni still have a bit of the watery eyes but zero sneezingrunny nosennan absolute godsend especially now

 dear zyrtec hurry my friend
 depends what symptoms what are you taking how long have you been taking it some antihistamines like zyrtec take a few days to really get things under control sometimes you need something local like a fluticasone spray for nasal symptoms
 i take benadryl and zyrtec a pharmacist recommended this because zyrtec doesnut kick in fast enough and the types of medicine they are donut interact with each other so the benadryl is effective almost immediately and by the time it wears off the zyrtec is active

 i have horrendous allergies (including to my own dogs and cat lol) my doctor recommended doubling up on  hour medicine but it shouldnut be the same one  so i take allegra at night and zyrtec in the morning that with flonase every night has made such a difference

 zyrtec d is amazing for allergies especially headaches have to purchase it from pharmacy tho drinking a lot of water and massaging the area around sinus cavity are the other options but zyrtec d would highly recommend if its bad enough to cause headaches

 this is a real thing if your body suffered a horrendous and destructive virus your mast cells within your immune system might still be leveling out things like heat vibration and alcohol can be incredible triggers try a light antihistamine like famatodine or zyrtec every day

 honestly claritin or zyrtec work wonders for my allergies and i'm basically allergic to the outside hay fever tree pollen pollen in general dust i would highly recommend them
 lied about this case from day  there was knock at door amp; the police had the correct residence they were looking for taylorus exboyfriend who used her place for drug trafficking fire tell too
 my friend does it for dog allergies and she  recommends it and i even want to start doing it for my airborne allergies since theyure so bad i take a mg zyrtec every night or else i feel like death been like this since february for me the shots are worth it
 i don't have my own facebook account but borrowed a friend's i read your post i was scratching myself until i bled i started taking antihistamines and i stopped i take zyrtec every  hours if i miss a dose i start scratching i thought i would mention it
 i donut recommend it i went through it for  years and it only made them worse there are great otcus out there zyxel and zyrtec are the two that worked the best for me
 same i am allergic to everything and allergy shots were torture constant state of inflammation and sinus infections for years while getting shots and i don't feel like it made my allergies any better in the long run do not recommend zyrtec amp; flonase are lifesavers
 if it doesnut bother you too much on a daily basis i would not recommend i am still actively allergic to cats and dogs however have built a tolerance over the years so itus not too bad i also take one allegra in the morning and one zyrtec at night that has helped
 i'm allergic to dogs too got shots for five years as a kid and it helped a lot the test was key for us try to keep them out of your bed if possible zyrtec and flonase are my best friends pics of my fur babies because i don't care if i'm allergic to them uddude0d 
 iuve got bad allergies but not to the point of getting allergy shots ium on montelukast and a nasal spray for my seasonal allergies ium also allergic to cats and i used to just pop a zyrtec and then hang out with a bunch of cats so iud say it depends on your severity
 well it depends how many of the plants there i am allergic to because zyrtec can only do so much
 if your eye is swollen it might be allergies i recommend zyrtec to reduce the reaction and a small bit of tylenol to reduce inflammation
 oh also any antihistamine that has a d in the name (like zyrtec d mucinex dm) will be infinitely too drying so i recommend regular ol zyrtec the combo im taking rn is zyrtec before i go to bed and then flonase during the day if im really hurting
 watching the legend of korra episode of remembrance i feel like if i still high on zyrtec this would be a lot funnier
 idk what's in the air but i came home looking for zyrtec like a fiend udeudduddudebudeudd
 pseudoephedrine is sudafedd that's what you need when you get sudafed otc it's pe (phenylephrine) and it's doesn't work the same but pseudoephedrine can be in zyrtec claritin mucinex advil it's when you see the d at the end it's only available at the pharmacy
 i have become so dependent on zyrtec itus insane
 i didnut even think about this until i read your tweet but when i was in college i didnut have health insurance and i was living in a run down college rental home that made my asthma and allergies horrendous i couldnut afford my zyrtec (which wasnut otc yet) or my asthma meds
 you will build up an tolerance after a while if you have a minor allergy it also depends on the fur type regular dog fur ( think lab)bothers me a little bit but hairy type dogs ( bichon) really bother me zyrtec also helps a lot best of luck
 nothing hurts more than when you hit the end of your bottle of zyrtec and realize youure about to have to take out a small loan to buy another one udduded

 just started taking zyrtec a couple of weeks ago thanks to the end of the drought the pollen factor is wild this year luckily don't get coldsores that would suck to have at the same time as hayfever
 if would hand out  day packs of hydroxychloroquine zinc pepscid ac and zyrtec for people and then have those with worsening symptoms call their doctors covid would be no worse than the cold  instead he lets people lose their lungs and end up on ventilators
 yes i used to take mucinex dm but eventually i think my body got used to it and it stopped working but zyrtec has helped a lot so i'd recommend those two
 no i haven't tried xyzal i'll get some this weekend i take a zyrtec at night before bed but lately it's not been helping so i use the nasal spray too but that doesn't help much either uddudc ty meg
 udeudduddude0 yes i literally take zyrtec like my life depends on it i warm them a bowl of milk every night and they already know the routine uddude

 omg i need to try that she sent me a lil lavender spray uddudcc and same zyrtec every day udeudd
 girl iuve been using the lavender to go to sleep cus i stay sneezing before bed and it just ends up knocking me out uddude zyrtec is my bestfriend rn lol
 shout out to me for neglecting to take my zyrtec all weekend
 when i've tried lavender teaoleation with lavender oilvalerian tea  progressive relaxation and a few other things and still cannot sleep and am desperate for sleep i take a zyrtec (an antihistamine) it can take up to an hour to work but it usually delivers  a  hour sleep
 mg generic famotidine plus the occasional zyrtec got me through my s definitely helped with multiple symptoms (tho weirdly my legs would get red splotches even if my face didnut but i tend to keep my pants on in public so no biggie)
 depends on your condition the heaviest dose i took prescribed by dr was one in the morning either zyrtec or aerius and in the evening telfast  mgnntelfast is good for skin allergiesnnall are antihistamines but different chemical compound not the same for morning amp; evening
 i woke up with enough pressure in my sinuses to form diamonds out of coal overnight sos send zyrtec pls
 yeah it's likely environmental and just like with humans zyrtec doesn't work for everyone it's certainly not hurting her and may even help a little but it's not knocking out the problem my friend said her dog gets an allergy shot and there are prescriptions so (shrug)
 thanks for the follow back send zyrtec lol
 have you taken an antihistamine at all? if not i recommend trying that like zyrtec or claritin or benadryl if it doesnut go away after that or gets worse i recommend going to see your doctor
 itus mostly neverending sneezing plus runny nose itchyblurry eyes usually lasts only  hours bc i remember i have to dose up on zyrtec amp; flonase once i commit to that regimen usually ok 
 ium going to start you on dk this week so get over that touchdown allergy for me okay? iull prescribe u zyrtec if u need or something just stop with the fear of the end zone
 omg i have serious fall sinus issues this is the time of year i just load up on zyrtec i've known this was an allergy tho i could see how it could get lost on your end
 trixie and her sibling pixie adopted from the aspca after being surrendered due to allergies i found that i was also horribly allergic to them we kept them anyway all hail the power of zyrtec 
 per my allergist i'm on every type of allergy med that exists but this year is the first time i've been able to really spend tim outside in years i do flonase azelastine (a nasal antihistamine) and zyrtec in the morning then both sprays amp; montelukast aka singular at night
 i literally look like i have the flu lol eyes puffy canut breathe etc zyrtec is my friend
 i take a zyrtec (or generic equivalent) every day i recommend that with your morning coffeetea
 just paid  copay for my doctor to tell me cool my c and take some zyrtec same thing my dad said enno but nah i like to spend money udeudd
 runny nose congestion sneezing endless coughni got some equate severe cold and cough and it helped with the symptoms antihistamines like zyrtec or benadryl
 search for nondrowsy antihistamines (ex claritin or zyrtec) they tend to last longer as well so you don't have to take them as often avoid meds w diphenhydramine (benadryl) doxylamine (unisom) etc
 do you (or someone you know) have access to a costco? a friend picks me up a bottle of the generic zyrtec which is a year's supply and it costs  it's great also you don't need to be a costco member to purchase costco pharmacy prescriptions online or at the warehouses
 i highly recommend trying xyzal my allergist recommended it to me and it's better than any of the other ones i've taken even zyrtec which was like the only thing that would work for a long time
 lol i think having them since they were puppies is the saving grace when friends bring their dogs over i sneeze and my eyes get all swollen but i still take zyrtec every day but good luck and congrats
 i was about to say bigpharma i wanted to drop them however i need zyrtec for my allergies amp; my mother will not let go of her splenda seniors amp; their ways i recommend agave nectar as a replacement to get out of that brand nothing i just can't this brand is an octopus
 one day youure cool and the next youure ing everyone you saw over the weekend screaming uchave you seen my zyrtec?ud

 update on project am i still allergic to the flu shot left eyelid is significantly less swollen today injection site is still tender and minimally swollen but now slightly green i should probably get out of bed and take another zyrtec but life isnut very exciting nowadays

 if anyone has any good allergy medication recommendations plz lemme know uddudc so farnuc allegranuc claritin nuc zyrtec nuc benadryl (works but then i die for  hours)nnudeuddaudeuddaudeudda
 zyrtec and benadryl are my friends
 been having really bad allergies these past few weeks and nothing seemed to be working but i got me some allegra and that shit has been doing wonders definitely would recommend over zyrtec anyway
 i used to give my puggle a zyrtec to calm the allergies the vet recommended it maybe thatus whatus bothering your pooch udeudd
 most true double entendre ever  cheers now please pass the zyrtec
 claritin made me way too hyper i rock the zyrtec but i'm sure it doesn't do much these days benadryl is the friend i keep leaning on
 yeah and stress is a mcas trigger too not like there is a shortage of that in the world right now ( nni have mcas friends who are on  zyrtec a day tho  a day isn't much i take three different hs myself
 pollen is a nightmare and zyrtec is your friend
 yeah you end of living with daily zyrtec
 welcome to east tennessee zyrtec and kleenex will be your friend
 just downed a shot of bubble gum childrenus zyrtec bc cvs was out of the regular kindnnnot the worst shot iuve ever had would recommend in a pinch
 both my dogs have seasonal allergies what helps are standard allergy meds benadryl and zyrtec are both safe to use at the right dosage our vet recommended that after the scratching and biting got too much
 i cry when i take zyrtec i found out from a friend that her kidus pediatrician actually warned her about this side effect after her son broke down over literally spilled milk
 what happens if yuh take two zyrtec ? udeudd asking for a friend
 do you take a pecid with your allergy pill? if not i recommend it my seasonals swell my eyes shut if i don't take zyrtec and pepcid daily
 benadryl makes me absolutely pass out if youre taking it for allergies i reccomend zyrtec
 got eat meds or not i recommend zyrtec udeudd
 here too but lately my cocktail of zyrtec benadryl and vitamin c tends to give me relief and therefore ucconfidenceud itus allergies
 im boutta just pop a blend of allergy meds cuz just zyrtec aint cutting ittired of this misery stupid human vessel
 how old is he? you can try giving some allergy medicine zyrtec claritin or even benadryl my girl takes a different one depending on how bad it is also get a baby chest rub like vicks or zarbees and put it on chest and bottom of his feet then put socks on over that
 took zyrtec and a hot shower and feel totally good itus allergies so stressful being a nurse i have the tendency to catestrophic thinking with not doing anything about it nursesaretheworst
 benadryl and zyrtec are my best friends yearround
 pfft nincreasing sunlightnbeautiful blooms everywherengreat weather but still cool enough to have minimal bugsneaster amp; spring breaknmastersmlbfinalkentuckyderby (sometimes on the same weekend)nthe only downside is the pollen but that's why god made zyrtec
 i am deathly allergic to everything and zyrtec has been great for me iud recommend giving it a try
 i usually stop my zyrtec around the end of august but not this year
 my sister recommended zyrtec liquigels and they definitely help a lot more than other allergy meds iuve tried
 i do bc i find mare gets her worst bug bites at the end of the season i usuallt start her on zyrtec in august and take her off it around halloween
 before you find what works for you generally benadryl is more for emergencies second generation h blockers tend to have less side effects so i would look into those more personally i really like xyzal and famotidine for h and h but everyone is different ?
 take xyzal that would reduce that allergies significantly can try to use an air purifier humidifier vaporizer around your home to reduce allergens xyzal is the best allergy tablet i have ever taken and have recommended that to all my patients
 oopuddude then i guess xyzal is your familyus new best friend
 dr donald mcronald md prescribed me  injections and said it was zyrtec he swore i wouldn't get suspended 
 alright weure gonna do total tmi i forgot my glasses so i have to wear contacts until theyure shipped to me pain on top of that this place is horrendous on my allergies so ium sometimes doing two zyrtec a day with the result that my nose is dry as paper
 is it possible for allergy medicine to heighten your allergy symptoms? jesus on my second recommended medicine u claritin did absolutely nothing and now zyrtec seems to be making me sneeze more
 so sorry to hear this zyrtec or genric pill is wonderful for hives i have chronic hives and itus the only pill that works take it at night go to an allergist versus a dermatologist if it doesnut help if you need a recommendation dm meuddude0a
 spends  in target still forgets the reup on zyrtec 
 shout out to antihistaminesnso damn grateful for zyrtec this weekend this would suck so much more if i didnut have a way to suppress the itchy redness uddudef
 i have been using zyrtec antihistamine for many years to help manage the downstream effects of myalgice  as with most medications it is recommended to start low and titrate up slowly to see how respond some antihistamines gave me wicked headache trial and error
 i guess i should try the antihistamine thing i tend to avoid benadryl because of the drowsiness but nondrowsy antihistamines like zyrtec don't seem to do much for me
 depends what type of mucinex and what you are trying to treat guaifenesin alone is useless antihistamine like citirizine (zyrtec) or loratadine (claratin) plus pseudoephedrine (for congestion but may not let you sleep) amp; dextromethorphan (for cough) are good combinations
 btw if you donut plan on eating with the aspirin iud recommend coated tablets if you can but it has honestly been life altering for me i went from  mg of zyrtec (max dose)  mg of pepcid quercetin montelukast and other stabilizers to almost nothing being needed itus
 yeah i was pissed when zyrtec was no longer prescription but they still will do it ended up costing waaaay less it was a pain in the ass to get rite aid to do it though had to have goodrx call the pharmacy
 it depends on the severity of your allergy amp; the type of antihistamine you are takingni have multiple nonseasonal allergies so i take a zyrtec every nightnit does make you drowsy thus night doesnif your allergy is specific to something you can dose according to when you'll gt;
 i got sick at the end of december i thought i was in hell i was so stopped up i couldnut breathe i seen my dr january rd my flu test amp; strep were neg i was put on antibiotics cough meds nose spray tylenol zyrtec amp; singulair it took me  months to get over it cough took  
 zyrtec  flonase are my best friends
 i use allegra personally zyrtec knocks me out in like an hour and i end up sleeping longer than i should
 prolonged use of zyrtec d seems to have an opposite effect of what it's intended to do nnmy resting heart rate has even gone down  bpm it's crazy nni'm interested to see what's going to happen over the next couple days i'm coming back guys
 oh yeah thatus def an allergic reaction ium also allergic to avocados is the itchiness the only thing? if so iud recommend zyrtec or its off brand version (cetirizine hcl tablets) they help a lot for me
 seeing a couple people on my timeline that have loved ones testing positive for covid amp; wanted to share that i was recommended zyrtec ium not sure about the science but i will say for what itus worth it has worked wonders for me today your loved ones are in my prayers uufe0f
 ium feeling a lot better this afternoonevening was recommended zyrtec on top of all the other stuff and it for some reason has really worked
 zantac was the other med so zyrtec and zantac controlled them really well for me that is really rough i would definitely recommend asking them to look for ana positive blood result trouble sleeping can be a sign of thyroid disease too
 bi zyrtec iu00etim kendime geldim alerjik yoldau0flaru0m su0ku0 duralu0m zor zamanlardan geu00eiyoruz
  astounding and oh so damn intimidating the way you always seem to know when i need a happy and ucrandomlyud start sending me kitty pics is everything to me i canut wait to overdose on zyrtec so i can finally hug up the three of you and have you feed me some of that delicious 
 what makes covid deadly is the lack of early treatment recommendations  something as simple as pepscid ac reduces death by   why?  it stalls the cytokine storm nd covid phase and gets in the lungs fast  make it more effective with an antihistamine like zyrtec
 they all work differently and it depends on whatus triggering it benadryl is going to work well with the itching but the other stuff sounds more anxiety related and allegra zyrtec etc arenut likely to help at all with that see a doctor
 zyrtec my friend

 i fully expect to still need allergy meds before this though i was taking  sudafed two zyrtec four bendaryl with nose spray as needed a day to get through a day two allergy meds as day would be amazing
 why are people so mad about ben using a natural method for treating covid? this is equivalent to me berating someone for taking allegra for allergies when i think zyrtec works better there are a lot of remedies to use depending on the severity of symptoms get a life people
 i am allergic to zyrtec and anything in the same family as it i can take benadryl for allergies and thatus it i was also allergic to a medication for endometriosis called orilissa maybe itus related to zyrtec

 my allergy doctor does not recommend getting rid of pets if you are allergic he says the world is basically covered in pet dandruff bc so many ppl have pets you might try zyrtec and flonase they're both available over the counter
 the makers of zyrtec need to list crazy ass dreams as the number  side effect of taking their medicationnnmy dreams today have included a high speed chase that ended up with me being at a random hotel and meeting steve harvey

 i started sniffling yesterday amp; today amp; now ium fucking paranoid bc of covid amp; have been filling my body with zyrtec d advil tylenol amp; some other medicine nni usually get sick the around the last week of october(my friends can testify to this) but i am still scared as hell
  friends on our street including a  year old child with breathing problems have had the virus and recoveredpepsid and zyrtec
 hereus your annual reminder that if you take for a long period of time your body can become dependent and if you stop using it you can break out in hives and intense itching
 let me anonymously send her some zyrtec in the mail
 zyrtec d be my best friend uddude0
 it's not the only difference between me and someone who is getting it again is i know how to treat it when it comes if someone fails to mitigate their own symptoms waits too long to take an aspirin too long to take zyrtec or pepcid they could end up needing transplants
 today at the reservoir a woman sneezed and her friend was like oh do you have allergies? and she was like yeah haha i forgot to take my zyrtec  i put it in all caps because i was wearing headphones and could still hear them so i think they said it for my benefit udeudda0
 could be allergies related to his food or just allergies our vet had us try zyrtec for our lb golden and it worked for a while ended up getting him allergy shots and changers the protein in his diet shots arenut cheap around  including the visit
 mine takes half a zyrtec some days she gets the other half at the other end of the day
 have a friend drive to get zyrtec d for you  has to be the decongestant ()
 didnut take my zyrtec this weekend and now i canut stop sneezing udeudd
 if ur itching u should probably take some like allergy medicine or something i recommend zyrtec
 they would rather get a morgue than send a team out with  day covid treatment packs of hydroxychloroquine zinc pepscidac zyrtec vitamin d  nnyesit is that easy  stop the madnessnnat a minimum pepscidac and zyrtec would reduce deaths nndonut let people die
 i'm sick of sneezing i'm sick of my eyes being all puffy and watering i'm sick of my throat itching i'm sick of folks acting like i got the plague i'm sick of it all udduded fall allergies are sooooo much worse than summer allergies send help and zyrtec uddudeduddudedudduded
 i lost nonutnovember a while ago so yes i didn't even realize that it was november when i did it a result of a sideeffect of a medicine i take for my sneezing fits i took zyrtec for my allergies and the result was sleeping through most of the weekend
 welcome to capitalism sweetie pie sugar plum if you want to play this game u  ium feeling a lil stuffy ium not snorting splenda or neutrogena maybe iull take a benadryl or zyrtec maybe a sudafed if ium feeling frisky donut be fucking dense

 claritin is pretty weak so maybe try switching to a different one my doc recommends zyrtec (could make you sleepy so take it at night) or xyzal allegra works pretty well for me personally and claritin did almost nothing for me
 ium thinking xyzal aka levocetirizine? thatus the one that i use i definitely recommend double checking especially about the maize starch i canut do corn but i havenut had any issues with the meds but of course your allergy to corn may be more severe
 i find that flonase and taking xyzal helps me tremendously i also use my netti pot from time to time
 i recently started allergy shots and though itus been tough on my immune system itus also strengthening it in the long term ium allergic to cats and  other allergens uddude also highly recommend xyzal too
 thats good i try to follow up with patients or others and try to learn newer ways to help treat ailments for allergies i was a claritin person then zyrtec and now xyzal its also how i learn to recommend better to others
 i went to the house of a friend and she has a super cute cat and i had to take extra zyrtec bc omfg
 ipratropium and azelastine sprays have changed my life ipratropium finally dried up my year postnasal drip i still take zyrtec for allergic dermatitis and also flonase but adding azelastine helped and then ipratropium ended the drip
 zyrtec can work miracles it does nothing for me but worked like a charm on my late husband  i hear you however certain times of the year that may not be enough  i only recommended benadryl in case you were doing zero antihistamine

 awww sweetie baby frank has sneezy fits too his are usually allergies tho; i end up giving him half a zyrtec
 you can take the pharmacy tech out of the pharmacy but you canut take the pharmacy out of the pharmacy tech i just uxued open packages of zyrtec and sudafed at home because ium fucking insane apparently send help
 i normally wouldnt reccomend meds over the web but as far as i know it's either not possible or very difficult to overdose on zyrtec taking more just adds more drowsy worth talking to a doctor or allergist if you're worried but stopgap solution just take some zyrtec
 ah yes i never take those in the amonly in the night since they have an off label use of knocking you out  iud recommend claratinxyzalallegra or zyrtec for  hour allergy relief
 a play in  acts to be repeated endlesslynnme huh i don't feel very good something's off super tired and just ehngf hm did you take a zyrtec today? nme uhh no takes zyrtec huh okay yeah i feel great now
 so glad you got great care please follow up with an allergist epinephrine is always the first line against anaphylaxis and benadryl is not recommended zyrtec (cetirizine) is better since itus nonsedating but always epi first for anaphylaxis

 ium also wondering if my nightly zyrtec isnut helping iuve got a friend who says it encouraged insomnia but i dunnoudeudd
 ium only two days post op but i definitely recommend getting a really long phone charger compression stockings (helps against bloodclots) and an allergy medicine to help with itching (i use zyrtec but idk if thatus available in the uk would recommend asking the doctor for recs)
 i need to send her some zyrtec  kleenex  nasal spray  something  
 recommend taking a short acting antihistamine like regular benadryl not allegra or zyrtec i think the reason we experienced the itching is because we were suppressing histamine release for so long with the long acting drugs it built up in our system
 in dc my dr would give me cough syrup wcodeine so i wouldnut get bronchitis up here drus are significantly less generous with opioid rxs so i make do wfishermanus friend and zyrtec
 depends for instance the allergy medication zyrtec is just derived from it's chemical name cetirizine and sounds cool
 i took both claritin and zyrtec today it feels like spring never ended
 nah it was just zyrtec lmao i tend to not take any medication but when i do i go into hibernation
 the ones on fsa store are actually decent lmao i also stock up on allergy meds they carry zyrtec so iull buy doubles and send some to mom
 what does melatonin and pepcid do for serotonin excess? zyrtec was also recommended
 this or the benadryl creams will be your best friend and maybe take a zyrtec i believe they are non drowsy 
 i'm allergic to smoke smoking somehow made that better a friend explained why to me a few days ago while we laughed because it is so ridiculous but my allergies were almost nonexistent while i smoked and as you know i now take zyrtec daily
 second thing you could do is take a second generation antihistamine one effective tablet is called zyrtec mg a day would help relieve a lot of the symptomsbut i canut legally recommend you take it without consulting a doctor first even though its sold without a prescription
 not sure what other meds you're on but i end up taking cetrizine (zyrtec) for muscle painrestless legs almost as often as i take it for allergy symptoms don't know if it will help since you're c but may be worth a try? (it also helps my daughter's eczema flares too so??)
 someone send me zyrtec i'm having an allergy attack rn
 i donut believe in kharma if u do yours is good bc despite all odds youure still here being a wonderful supportive twitter friend sorry about the reaction never hurts (me) to add zyrtec pepcid and tylenol to the mix can help big hugs
 ohhh thatus why everyone was talking about antihisthamines c bright bby iull send you a box of zyrtec okay we allergic folks need to stick together 
 imagine having a friend be so allergic to crab but saying fuck it yolo to crab pasta let me go buy you some zyrtec lol
 i took zyrtec for the first time yesterday i ended up tripping my ass off for hours i could taste colors
 claritin is pretty weak so maybe try switching to a different one my doc recommends zyrtec (could make you sleepy so take it at night) or xyzal allegra works pretty well for me personally and claritin did almost nothing for me
 are you using an antihistamine (claritinallegrazyrtec) too? if you donut have a sinus infection it should help a decent bit my doctor would also recommend a nasal saline irrigation
 it's so crazy how after the kardashians announced the show was ending khloe has become executive producer of a show on id (twisted sisters) she's got a deal with febreze and now she has a deal with zyrtec udeuddd0 wtf is going on? step to the mic please 
 udeuddnbf going to er through a gazzilion tests for left arm pain swearing it was the end when it turns out that if you don't take zyrtec during allergy season (like i told him  times) you can get muscle aches and chest tightness derp
 i finally figured out mine were caused by sinus issues from suddenly going from cold air outside to warm air inside my sinuses drying out suddenly after i removed my mask scent sensitivities lavender amp; anything pine scented taking otc zyrtec amp; saline nasal spray helped 
 you can not take zyrtec and be close to what you are allergic fornzyrtec is just a histamine receptor blocker  it won't save you from whatever boosts your immune system to end producing those histamine it won't save you on the long run
 why should people get tested when they are not given anything until they need a hospital?  send these people home with  day packs of hydroxychloroquine or tell them to run  days of artemisinin pepscid ac zyrtec both of these treatments would have saved thousands
 start taking nfamotidine mg bid (pepcid ac x day)ncetirizine mg bid (zyrtec x day)nnmy friend had covid last month and felt better after  days of taking this cocktailn
 yalla zyrtec do your magic and send me to sleep
 yes this also allergies can irritate the lungs causing acute bronchitis happened to my friend at the beginning of the pandemic and some zyrtec stopped our panic immediately
 hoarding is real man nni cant bring myself to buy anything nonessential usually unless im very depressed but i will buy and hoard food and medicines like advil and zyrtec like my life depends on it for no reason other than i worry i wont one day have those two things
 my kitty has become a lot more needy (heus turning ) and because of this my allergies are sooooo bad claritinzyrtecbenadryl donut work for me anymore but allegra helps any recommendations? mainly decongestants pls
 right? i also have zyrtec d dependence amp; have to pay for dr visits to get script written for it so pharmacy can fill enough bc there is a limit on pseudoephedrine bc i might have a crystal meth lab at home amp; seek pseudoephedrine wtf
 what is quercetin and do you know why it would be recommended? i knew about the vitamins but had not heard of quercetin hospitals where i live are recommending zyrtec and pepcid as wellsounds crazy but they help against inflammation udeuddudcudffcuduufe0f
 i have really bad allergies and i have  hrs to get better any recommendations? (i already took zyrtec didnut do much for me )
 zyrtec d and flonase are your friends they knock out allergies in no time

 but if you are discussing brand zyrtec you are still inflating the price by about  even when looking at cvs which tends to be on the most expensive side of retailers 
 use zyrtec amp; sudafed extended caplets to control allergies top filterete acfurnace filter for removing molds fungus dust mites amp; viruses avoid all moldfungal possible keep all irritants away from nasal passages amp; lungs wearing n outside helps a lot in humid climate
 i know you already got answers but i have hives daily amp; highly recommend zyrtec if you're like me amp; benadryl doesn't work also this itch cream 
 hi based on symptoms as she said there is no conclusive testing yet my geneticist diagnosed me with mcas when she diagnosed heds ium on pepcid zyrtec and cromolyn sodium the combination has definitely helped tremendously
 same zyrtec is my best friend
 imagine at the same time sending people home with a day pack of hydroxychloroquine zinc famotidine and cetirizine (pepscid ac  zyrtec)  incredibly low risk with a high reward cost effect and scalable  all could be easily taken safely for  days  stop the madness
 what works for you? i take rhinocort (corticosteroid) daily for the entire hayfever season and then claratyne or zyrtec on the days when i start to get symptoms this approach was recommended to me by a respiratory physician friend and has worked well for the last few years
 right there with you though i only have one kitty right now  claritin (or zyrtec) and flonase are my very good  friends
 we have two cats and i offer my friends with allergies zyrtec at the door and also vacuum and clean before they come over i also try to keep some areas of the house cat free and open windows and keep benadryl on hand and also just try to go to their house if it's a big deal
 i switch backandforth between flonase and zyrtec depending on the seasonnnyou can also build tolerances to each so itus good to switch
 meds such as zyrtec which i take daily nnanyway i still donut get the ucwhyud if this but it was sort of cool imo but now i want to know whynnand yes i was that kid ucwhy? why? why?ud end
 also i begged for an extension this morning and i got left on read udeudd i would say that's gonna keep me up tonight but i think i just accidentally took  zyrtec instead of one so that's where i'm at right now lol send help 
 zyrtec is your friend monka
 yeah really depends on your allergy i have terrible seasonal grass allergies and i take zyrtec daily and use flonase for really bad days allergy shots are also a really good option if your insurance will cover it
 friendship ended with zyrtec that never did shit for me anyways
 me when i donut take a zyrtec before visiting or any friend w cats for the matter 
 it was  for  and i think like  for  udduded i bought name brand zyrtec but generic eye drops cause there was no way i was spending that much but altogether i spent close to  udeudd
 flonase and zyrtec are my best friends 
 thats good i try to follow up with patients or others and try to learn newer ways to help treat ailments for allergies i was a claritin person then zyrtec and now xyzal its also how i learn to recommend better to others
 i keep making my friends who wonut get covid tester take some zyrtec and theyure only allowed to refuse a test if the zyrtec fixes them instantly
 the answer is c zyrtecd (levocetirizine  pseudoephedrine) pse is a vasoconstrictor that elevates blood pressure there is debate about how dangerous occasional pse use is in controlled hypertension but it is probably best to be safe and recommend something else 
 i took mg of sudafed mg of naproxen and then added a zyrtecd  hour and it feels a little better not as much pressure when i bend over and stand back up ill survive the day
 nothing that zyrtecd and flonase canut cure stay healthy my friend

 iuve had two bouts of flu even though i took the shot one in january and one that started thursday i got to the doc in  hours of first symptoms for nd flu and started on tamiflu going back to school tomorrow fever ended sunday; doc made me wait a full day
 immunity takes two weeks to build so probably the best you can do how is practice good hand hygiene and stuff like that nnmaybe get a preemptive prescription for tamiflu in case you do end up getting it that's supposed to be started within like  hours after symptom onset
 falling over videos are suspect forcible removals are  a china communism  human rights issuennanecdotally everyone i know with a flu shot is just fine but my friend who refused flushot or tamiflu was down for  entire weeks yo very fit male
 may i suggest that this applies to you as well most doctors agree with the whos recommendation on tamiflu and here you are saying that the fda the who and other medical experts are wrong
 a doctor recommended that for my grandson because of the cost difference said it would do the same as tamiflu
 interestingso what's your agenda here? nbc news says tamiflu is dangerous and then does a  so they can target anti vaxxers 
 i need to start buying stock in whoever makes tamiflu ium spending a fortune on it
 there is a special place in hell for those using this childus death to push an agenda tamiflu is not a cure no one has died from lack of tamiflu in fact quite the opposite 
 tamiflu made me feel really uneasy and the day i stopped taking it was when i had my really bad panic attack nnit doesnut cure the flu it helps with symptoms until you recover nni wouldnut take it again amp; i recommend others donut 
 hey how are you? momma got no luck my friends sheus got flu now as if she hasnut had to deal with enough i feel bad she had a shot too as she is in hi risk category and so did everyone else but somehow she got it now the men all need to take tamiflu  if they feel symptoms

 hypothetical if you were down with influenza all this past weekend and your fiance has his bachelor party this upcoming weekend would you give him tamiflu as postexposure prophylaxis to protect his bachelor party weekend?
 so my bossu babies have the flu and he is on tamiflu but if i end up getting the flu and miss slytherin night and the rd i will riot at work
 they had to distract from the trending news that tamiflu was causing problems and being sued
 my friend is also affected by flu and seems to have managed to surpass him with tamiflu
 had to wind up going to the er this morning bc this cold bug was killing me only to find out i have influenza b dr gave me tamiflu to take the next  days not a great way to spend the morning but hopefully get some relief soon
 my friend is isolated by princess diamond the shipsaysthat fluis more serious than corona my friend is also affected by flu and seems to have managed to surpass him with tamiflu today for the first time in  days i was allowed to walkforhouronthesundeck
 agreed the tamiflu may or may not have helped but at the end of the day there's a deceased child taking advice from an antivax fb group is like asking an interior decorator how to fly plane totally preventable tragedy see a pediatrician it's maddening vaccineswork 
 what a bad story there is no proof that tamiflu woulduve saved him my girls were vaccinated as well as myself and we all ended up with influenza i did not give it to either of my children because in the past it caused severe vomiting dehydration from vomiting can be worse
 those doctors screwed up badly by giving a  year old tamiflu  specifically in the late stages of the illnessnnthey should be suspended and sued at leastnncommon knowledge is to never give a young child tamiflu beyond the first  hours if at all
 i was at the end of my first trimester with my son when i got the flu it was bad enough that i understood very clearly how people can die from the flu my doctor (highrisk ob) prescribed tamiflu i took it and heus a healthy kid
 tamiflu is a godsend
 i took tamiflu and two weeks later got pneumonia and ended up in the hospital
 neithernnnobody really dies from the flu just secondary infections caused by a weakend immune systemnnyou could have a horrible reaction to tamiflu and diennso neithet
 umsois there a black market for tamiflu? and theoretically if one wanted to score where would one go? asking for friend
 youure still missing the first sentence lol ucchildren with the fluud ndonut just keep cropping the end of it 
 ium sorry that youure sick nni dropped off tamiflu for friends earlier and then i drank waaaaaaay too much saku00e
 tamiflu is a god send that is all
 tamiflu causes sudden death as well as sepsis cytokine storm pneumonia neuropsychiatric disorder that's why  of doctors don't recommend it 
 and the dozens of children who've been vaccinated for the flu and took tamiflu and still died? have you not heard of them? tamiflu is a killer it causes sudden death that's why only about  doctors recommend it they know 
 tamiflu has serious side effects one of them sudden cardiac death this is why there are many stories in the media of kids who've taken tamiflu and died this is why half the doctors don't recommend tamiflu 
 been running around and just watching the end of the game? has been in or was is tamiflu the entire game? xfl
 i donut care your thoughts on anything this is highly irresponsible journalism from a reporter with an agenda who didnut do her due diligence 
 good wasn't going to be able to make it had a rough weekend also having to take tamiflu mom ended up with minor flu and i'm having to take it as preventive even though i kind of have a half flu which is weird
 lol ium on tamiflu and robitussin honey for coughi been down all weekend gotta shake back by tomorrow
 tamiflu is recommended not to be administered if the symptoms are present past  days you have to be early in the process that being said many clinicians order it to improve customer satisfaction even when they know it will not be effective
 did you hear about the mom whose doctor recommended tamiflu to her son? she went to an antivax facebook group who convinced her not to the son died of flu so the fb group is getting blamed there must be more to the story than they're saying
 according to the mother of the boy who died from the flu he was vaccinated  as for tamifluthe info on that treatment is so horrendous who in their right mind would use it? do the research  she followed doctor's instructions for treatment but they love to omit this info
 antivaccine facebook group members tell mother of unvaccinated yrold with flu not to give him tamiflu recommend elderberries instead; boy dies; antivaxxers scrub facebook page of interaction 
 itus important to disclose that tamiflu is being accused of fraud; for skewing their trial results before you recommend the drug tamiflu to consumers with the flu or even suggest not doing so is inappropriate tamiflu could be involved in a rico case 
 tamiflu has never been or used as a vaccine it is an antiviral it's key ingredient has been proven to help your body and more than likely decrease time of recovery tamiflu does work (for what it's intended to do) but people keep speaking about it as if it was a placebo
 it is not anyoneus place to recommend or deny treatment for a child you do not know have not seen and are medically unqualified to diagnose it is our responsibility however to advise someone to seek medical attention from a physician nn
 i woke up at am did a dab amp; decided to look at fbnna family friend posted the article of the boy who recently died from the flu ranting about vaccinating tamiflu putting others at risk blah blah blahnni posted the article saying they reported before interviewing
 iuve been a patient to doctors like that so i see where youure coming from but at the end of the day a  year old died because the mother refused to get tamiflu for his flu if she had listened to the doctor this might not have happenedn
 tamiflu can helpn mother chose to ignore medical advice choosing instead to go antimainstreammedicine  that is the whole point of the articlennthat you cannot see the actual issue here is not a recommendation of your point of view
 tamiflu is an antiviral lots of people had that when the swine flu was around still not sure how i managed to dodge it when loads of my friends got it

 ium so sorry youure sick on sick i hope the tamiflu helps and that you feel better soon rest well sending very gentle hugs
 i know how to read i do recommend some reading comprehension courses for you though you should also click on the pic i posted to read all the content ie tamiflu is not routinely given as preventative measure nice try though
 look okay i don't normally endorse this because i am in that industry and i know most hands are tied but if you get prescribed xofluza and it's not covered and the coupon brings it to ish feel free to harass the fuck out of your doctors office until they give you tamiflu
 my granddaughter got ulcers in her mouth and her throat was so swollen she ended up in the ernjust one dose of tamiflu udufe0fnpeople need to read about the horrible side effects that tamiflu produces it can be deadly
 time is of the essence with tamiflu waiting too long to administer it after the initial recommendation was still not a good thing to do
 tamiflu is typically recommended for those who are really ill or have high risk of complications the child must have been really ill for the doctor to even prescribe it this is complete negligence
 katie hendrickson whoever she is is putting posts on fb saying nbc lied about the colorado tamiflu story and that the child died after taking tamiflu you should set the story straight 
 docs are always happy for the business if you want to come innbut nn) tamiflu may not be that effective even when taken in the first  hours (but for high risk patients itus worth a try and is recommended) 
 oh come on he campaigned for hillary like flu campaigned for tamiflu after literally refusing to do so and i'm not sure how you inferred i thought the left is biden i support warren you couldn't be more wrong however if you trash hillary or the dnc it won't end well

 do you have sinus? or is it just a fever and i ended up getting tamiflu but it didnut work so i had to get a z pack as well but i was in the hospital for like a day or so it was the worst thing in my life
 so thatus why tamiflu was trending the other day 
 rn for  yrs not an antivaxxer i now care for  small grands while parents work fb grp is total bs but you called out mom not fb tamiflu is not recommended for littles u00b0 not emergent in littles google it like you should've before accusing greiving mother
 this is how we end up with antivaxxers who cause measles outbreaks or the deaths of yearolds because they don't want to give their kids tamiflunnthis is how we may all be wiped out by a pandemicnndipshits who think they're entitled to an invalid opinion
 ok but my daughters pediatrician recommended staying clear of tamiflu because the side effects are terrible
 ucnatural curesud she was treating all four of her children with u including peppermint oil vitamin c and lavender u were not working and asked the group for more advice the advice that came in the comments included breastmilk thyme and elderberrynudeuddcnn
 again thank you for showing your colors defending the blatant promotion of tamiflu contained in the piece thank you for showing that this was about tamiflu all along
 anyways zadrozny makes the leap that not using tamiflu caused the childus death however in an interview the mother confides that she did give every medication recommended by her doctors and he still died 
 oh dr howard i thought you said you werenut defending tamiflu now you have dropped your pretense at least that way we know what are we dealing with here
 ok at least you are now in the open defending tamiflu at least you have stopped pretending this thing was about some antivaxxers now youure in the open promoting tamiflu as a life saver good i prefer when people lie in the open
 so i couldn't get a flu shot because i'm on immune suppressors and i just tested positive for influenza btamiflu and sleeping for the weekend
 so many people coming out of the woodwork to defend this womanus decision to deny her child medical care is astounding and many of them start with uci would have given my child the tamiflu butudnnno buts this womanus decision to trust karen on fb needs to be condemned
 you took the words out of my mouth i know doctors who would even recommend elderberry before tamiflubecause you canut argue facts research and benefitsudeuddudcudffcuduufe0f
 no one is arguing that tamiflu is for everyonewithout severe side effects chemotherapy is also not recommended to the general public and even some actual cancer patients the whole point of this dang thread is that sometimes you gotta weigh awful side effects against death

 and yes the main drug in tamiflu (the medication that this post was actually about not vaccines) would have had a double blind study (project or clinical trial depending on the year it underwent initial funding)
 ruthie  do you have credible statistics to substantiate your claim or did you hear that on fox news? nnat the end of the day tamiflu coulduve saved this childus life but because of people like you it wasnut given based on fear and scare tactics nnproud of yourself?
 no     i am so so sorry to hear this    drink fluids is my only advice besides get tamiflu if you can   seems to truncate it   i am sending healing thoughts your way
 i think itus trying to tie the anti medicine propaganda of these antivax groups not necessarily use of tamiflu lavender and peppermint oil for flu does not an effective treatment make one wonders that if mom had not been antivax would the child have survived?
 i'm just looking at the general recommendations they will vary for certain individuals you can't apply your families' case to everyone else nni'm tired of this conversation and it's going nowhere the kid was prescribed tamiflu for a reason
 i didnut rush to judgment she said online that sheud been given a prescription for tamiflu and didnut fill it because of antivaxx concerns if itus the same mom then she did not give her kids all recommended drugs as claimed
 the only misinformation we've seen here is that coming from you saying tamiflu works automatically disqualifies you from being taken seriously you have an hidden agenda and we can all see it 
 you're not a nurse if you were you'd know tamiflu doesn't work not even recommended in the uk the length of deceit and lies you pharma shills go to is laughable

 yes brandy and the nbc should be investigated for negligence and hopefully this mother once she can will sue the hell out of them tamiflu isn't recommended anywhere outside the us 
 i had a friend of mine that would not listen to me about tamiflu she was sent some link from someone on facebook her kid ended up in the hospital two weeks with influenza b pneumonia and walking pneumonianeedless to say she is listening to me now thankfully the child is ok
 tamiflu and dialysis (hfhd) first dosis befor long time weekend 
 they literally did every damn thing recommended by doctors including giving the tamiflu but of course the fucking social media vampires have latched onto her having asked a question in a stupid fb group
 i hope the mother sues this pos reporter and nbc it's now known that the mother did give tamiflu and all required medications imagine having to endure the loss of a child only to be bullied online tamiflu  
 one last time before i show you out i don't give a shit about tamiflu not defending it not promoting it i'm interested in this conversation bc i care about the fact that fb groups are acting as quasimedical providers and causing harm i hope you see that
 tamiflu and very young children can cause them to hallucinate  i have a grandson who is suffering from flu a as we speak he did have his vaccine as recommended i do have the rest of the family on elderberry syrup to help prevent even when theyuve had their immunizations
 i don't care about tamiflu i've never heard anyone recommend it in real life i wonder why you are so keen on it?nnthe article is about someone who ignored all medical advice give to her by the doctor when symptoms worsened she should have gone to the doctor again not to fb
 it alleviates the flu symptoms which is what actually kill you my niece had  last weekend given tamiflu temp normal in  hours yes it can be lifesaving that's why it's prescribed uddude
 ok iull bite i might even learn something about myself i am a family doctor who strongly encourages people to get the flu vaccine and i prescribe generic tamiflu when appropriate what is my personal agenda outside of healing?
 all natural does not mean safe or effective thyme elderberry lavender oil etc are not substitutes for actual medical care nna child is dead the death could have been prevented and this is not an isolated storynn via 
 we need to careful about facts posted i provided science on tamiflu and the flu vaccine's effectiveness or lack of you seem to be stoking some other agenda neither of us know all the facts or health of that child its tragic you should stop posting those ss's nite
 this should never happen in a society as technologically advanced as ours ntamiflu isn't even a vaccine yet now that's bad? no more antivirals at all? where does the madness end? 
 not giving tamiflu is concerning but was she also advised against giving tylenol or ibuprofen for high fever?  the flu complication that killed this child appears to be related to a febrile seizurennall these fb doctors care about is their agenda not your child's health
 how do you confirm the identity and if the same person reconcile the disparities? if the child was given tamiflu here are the side effects roche hid in their trials wh aes were more severe in children than adults cdc does not recommend tamiflu for treatment of the flu 
 then your pediatrician needs to learn the cdc guidelines  cdc recommends tamiflu for patients at a higher risk of complications from flu  this includes otherwise healthy children under  years of age  this child was 
 the real story from my dear friend circleofmamas uufe0fuddudcnn
 no it's about timing tamiflu stops the virus from replicating and getting worse so that your body has a better chance of fighting it off faster which is why it's recommended to be taken as soon as possible you fuckin dingus
 tamiflu isn't all that effective but it's the best treatment available for established flu and better than lavender oil etc   it's true nobody made her but perhaps they should have done   this is a dead child not a bargaining chip
 i told him about the death threats some had received  he continued to act as if i was defending tamiflu 
 yea exactly support ) there are interesting experiments in viral antibiotics going around with tamiflu prep the hiv drug and some other things but we will see i'm checking on the health of dozens of friends daily throughout the provinces of china worried for their health
 not sure that i would accept this pediatrician's recommendations  elderberry (folkloric) vs clinically tested  nnis this the trend to which you referred?  
  via she sets up a go fund me poage for her sons death? send letters to all the antivaxxers and see what she gets back i wouldnt give her a dime
 fwiw our doctor rarely prescribed tamiflu for kids bc itus so harsh on their tummies my youngest took it one time and ended up in the er wdehydration be mad she didnut follow up when he got worse not for skipping tamiflu
 to be fair vomiting probably was from the flu itself tamiflu can have some gross side effects but i don't think that was it i tend to be hyper sensitive to medications itself now if you didn't have the flu that's one thing and it could've done more harm than good there 
 okay but like are all of the people grandstanding about tamiflu in my replies right now intentionally missing my bigger point here about taking medical advice from their facebook friends who made a c in every science class they ever took or did it just sort of happen?
 my  kids all got the flu this year the doctor prescribed  round of tamiflu and told us that she wouldnut recommend taking it unless one of them ucgets really badud said the side effects of tamiflu are often worst than the flu
 i had influenza b a few months ago and spread it to a few friends i took tamiflu and my weekslong symptoms were gone told my friends to use tamiflu and theyure good too now it works and it works really well
 when these groups are recommending potentially medically unsound advice it can have a severely negative consequence 
 tamiflu is being outed as a sham and a fraud and possibly a killer so it needs to be sainted for the vax zealots to defend it like gardasil
 my friendus son tested negative last weekend but presented so many symptoms and itus so prevalent in our area that he was prescribed tamiflu anyway
 my childrenus doctor doesnut recommend tamiflu the potential side effects arenut worth the typical slight improvement nn
 it's irresponsible to jump on the media train  people who know this woman say she gave the recommended medicine(s)  it wouldn't be the first pharma death including from tamiflu
 my coworker came to work with the flu and her tamiflu i feel like she was purposefully endangering my health
 medtwitter is there much point in going to get the flu test? just supportive care make sure hydrated alternate tylenol and advil donut really want the side effects of tamiflu asking for a friend
 here let me do this for younn best tamiflu shortens the effects of the flu and i quotendoctors point out that there is very little high quality evidence that tamiflu reduces the rate of serious complications from the flu

 one of her kids passed away because she refused to take him to the hospital amp; give him tamiflu yuall antivaxxers are fucking nuts amp; if youure one amp; youure offended go ahead and block me i will never understand how someone can let their kid go through this 
 so the mother took her son to the doctor and he had the flu and they prescribed tamiflu (which works) she then proceeded to go home her on fb and let a bunch of strangers against vaccinations tell her how to treat her child and he ended up passing is that correct?

 i feel awful for the mother and the family i hope they can heal  i donut think itus clear that she gave the tamiflu  i think cernovich is trying to stir up things  that was my main concern  too often people use these situations to advance agendas
 awww sweetie i defend basic science i defend pediatricians everywhere i support vaccines and medicine like tamiflu nyou defend kooky conspiracy theories 
 anti vaxxer friend just posted some cherry picked antitamiflu stuff on an fb post of mine and i deleted them told her why and refuse to engage on it further i won't stand for it kids are dying because of it
 this makes me so sick your baby is having febrile seizures and you head to facebook for answers? dr gives you tamiflu to heal your sick kids and you donut give it to them? now that child is dead bc your agenda was more important than your childus health electric chair 
 no she stated she wasnut giving him tamiflu she also said she ended up giving it this needs to be retracted and the real story needs to wait until all the facts are out there because all these headlines are misleading

 of course the propagandist links an article which doesnut specifically state she gave the tamiflu  just that she gave the medicine recommended  she may just be referring to the natural remedies from the group  serial liar
 the kiddo i nanny had the flu this year his doctor said that tamiflu isn't going to cure the flu but makes the symptoms go away a little quicker and actually didn't recommend it because it causes hallucinations and other side effects
 my dr said she doesnut recommend tamiflu so i choose to believe her amp; the research iuve done
 hedied he was just in preschool? why? please vaccinate use tamiflu when recommended please     on facebook antivaxxers urged a mom not to give her son tamiflu he later died      
 i couldnut get vaccinated this year and got the flu tamiflu was a godsend ium absolutely thankful for it why would you deny it to your children?
 so god forbid if my friend dies do you think her dr will be charged with negligence? you are aware that tamiflu helps ease the flu symptoms doesn't 'cure' ot it also has side effects like all pharamsudicals
 well think mom made a terrible mistake and everyday is a reminder of that mistake i was just commenting that maybe taking advice of people who recommend a potato isnut smart kids and elderly and those with compromised immune systems are at high risk tamiflu 
 i originally expected tamiflu but according to out regular pediatrician it wasnut recommend for kids his age? he had a respiratory cough thing the week before his diagnoses then flu the week prior and flu b came with a stomach bug day  he kept a temp of  or over for days
 iuve been home with my  year old son for a week due to flu it got scary he was diagnosed last friday with flu b his pediatrician didnut offer or recommend tamiflu apparently it causes seizures in kids? we did over the counter meds bathsdiligently checking temps
 agreed but the point could have been made without calling her out my ped doesnut recommend tamiflu (a urmc doc) so how is this different?
 this kids parents did the shot and tamiflu  did it change anything?  stop pretending that these meds and shots are effective at anything  they arenut 
 tamiflu saved my sons life and life of my friend son as well
 and even if she hadn't that wouldn't make her a negligent mother given that drug is useless not even recommended in the uk 
 legend took the tamiflu when he had the flu amp; he was cured quick af
 very sad but not surprising people who jump on a trend based on thinks beechgrove  their gut or the cheers of a clown might always be surprised or sad folks who think they do know better do not demonstrate that they know much  
 so the mom went to the dr and asked for tamiflu?  you act as though itus a guarantee that it woulduve helped  besides you think people donut ask questions on those pages but end up giving prescriptions anyways?  thatus what the mother said in her interview with cbs denver
 please look into the facts instead of leveraging this familyus tragedy to shame them and denigrate others tamiflu is not an effective treatment for flu and many pediatricians do not recommend it how about one of the most respected research organizations? 
 local news reported the childhad the vaccine and followed doctors instructions which was to take tamiflu  the reporter never contacted the mother  mother said nbc got the story completely wrong mob descended irrelevant that she asked for advice on a natural health website
 plans this weekend? i have the pleasure of taking tamiflu and installing fire blocking in my basement
 tamiflu works but it's not going take away all the symptoms nor work for everyonenn it worked great for my daughter amp; wife nnbut we're just going round amp; round hereand not looking to change so this ends here
 yeah we have no clue if tamiflu would have helped just pointing the alarming and scary trend of people pushing others to go against medical advice people shouldnut get shamed for taking medication
 tamiflu is useless so much so it's not recommended here in the uk i'm surprised no doctor has intervened they just sit back while a suffering human being gets bullied for no reason shameful

 okay don't get the flu shot that is fine but you are not going to give him a prescribed medication? tamiflu is not a vaccine amp; it works lovely my youngest has cld  amp; i thought we were going to end up in the hospital nafter  days of tamiflu she was back to her usual self
 these lying cowards implying tamiflu would have saved him in the uk i've never ever met a doctor who would recommend this medication because it's considered useless and not worth the side effects i feel for this mother  
 it's not negligent to avoid a medication that doesn't work you silly man thank god i live in the uk where our sensible national health service doesn't recommend this useless product 
 my kidsu pediatrician only recommends it for kids who are high risk for flurelated complications amp; not for everyone who catches the flu udeuddudcudffcuduufe0f that was the original indicated use of tamiflu we all get vaccinated though
 msnbc is doubling down and states that the original nbc story was real the cbs story seems to contradict truth may or may not come outnni am pro vaccine and am very aware of the controversies surrounding nais like tamiflu nnin the end we do not have a better treatment 
 omg people  tamiflu is your friend when you have a bad case of the flu vaccinations are good science is good science medicine 
 this debate will never end a yearold boy died of the flu after an antivaxxer facebook group told his mom to treat him with elderberries and breast milk instead of tamiflu 
 tamiflu saved me from an extensive hospitalization nndoctors usually do not recommend anti virals like tamiflu or prescribe antibiotics unless they are needed to slow the rate of drug resistant viruses amp; bacterianndoctors also take into account a patientus age when prescribing
 i donut know where youure getting this ingredient information from there is documentation for tamiflu from the fda and star anise is not a component ium also not sure what end the linked article is supposed to support they marketed the drug very inappropriately
 i don't make a habit of defending beth but they aren't antivaxx if you read her timeline she's actually very provaccine and thinks that people who don't vaccinate are dumb tamiflu isn't a vaccine and is actually rather controversial esp with children
 that's great but i've had doctors tell me that giving my child tamiflu wasn't worth the serious side effects  so which is it good or bad?  i guess it depends on the doctor?  if the next dr tells me to use it which advice should i adhere to??
 the article makes it abundantly clear thatnntamiflu is not a panaceanthe group also recommended against other supportive carenvaccination would have been more effectivennso itus weird to see people fixate in the headline because they dislike tamiflu
 day  of being sick tamiflu zyrtec and motrin are my best friends uddudda
 false reporting on your endnn
 nobody dies from lack of tamiflu and nobody knows if it would have helped in the slightest but lots of people in here pretending to be biblical level prophets and declare what would have been must be nice to know alternate future timelines supernatural ability
 just read an article on an antivaxxer who willingly let her  yo die instead of giving her son the prescribed tamiflu she let people in a facebook group recommend she treat him with elderberries and breast milk i feel for that baby and the other  siblings still in that house
 this grieving mother endured blame and hateful remarks because of an irresponsible inaccurate story what was her crime? asking questions about tamiflunnturns out she listened to her doctors  
 tamiflu only reduces symptoms by  days numerous doctors and pharmacists recommend natural remedies as a valid treatment option tamiflu is mostly given to satisfy patients but the flu is evolving quickly and getting stronger so a  year old is especially at risk for fatality
 day  of flu recovery at the boyfriend's house despite my lack of appetite he and his mom have ganged up and made me eat every day he's been giving me tamiflu and i'm being pumped full of fluids
 tamiflu may reduce symptoms however based on independent testing it has not been shown to reduce the severity of flu you've obviously not seen the research
 how these conspiracy theorists can do this to their own children is beyond my ability to comprehendn
 this was false reporting dan you are smarter than that look into it the mother did give her son tamiflu as her doctors recommended and then he died the reporter never interviewed the mother and had fake news big lawsuit coming
 on facebook antivaxxers urged a mom not to give her son tamiflu he later died the mother also wrote that the ucnatural curesud including peppermint oil vitamin c and lavender were not working  via 
 i have many friends and family in the medical field the vast majority of them agree that tamiflu has too many dangerous side effects for it to be 'safely' given to children a friend's child tried to commit suicide while taking it because he was having grotesque hallucinations
 found it  by searching nuc potatoesvirus ucnthanks for the headsupnnaggravating factor facebooknnso ium going to share this on my facebook wall because iuve got a few intransigent knucklehead friends who might just be shopping for potatoes soonn
 you and the nbc story conveniently leave out the detail where she did end up giving the kid tamiflu that would get in the way of the narrative though so i can see why youud leave it out
 not an antivaxer both myself and my kids have all recommended vaccines  but i won't takegive tamiflu it's a waste of money most of the time just not much that does any good against a virus
 a doctor prescribed the tamiflu witch doctors suggested potatoes in the kids socks don't defend the indefensible
 concern wasnut with tamiflu or another pediatrician coulduve been consulted itus a concept that lavender amp; peppermint oil are substitutes for medical treatment if your child is sick amp; you question advice youuve been given seek other professional advice not a facebook group
 because the seizures were happening due to the fever tamiflu was not going to prevent that ibuprofen or tylenol was i still think she had to give them the medication just bc of their age to help them decrease the symptoms but this didnut mean it was going to help tremendously
 i see this every day because we are still on flu season we have around  patients coming w the flu the doctors of course recommend tamiflu to them but immediately explain the effects and what exactly does
 influenza the flu is very dangerous for kids under  and seniors which is why doctors recommend them to get the tamiflu just in case this does not mean you are getting cured influenza is a virus thereus no cure
 wow brandy what a scary fearmongering freak you are not only does she dispute your claim but there are even doctors who do not recommend tamiflu either great journalism n
 thatus not what it said she does not say she gave him the medication she was prescribed she posted that she did not pick up the prescribed tamiflu but gave him lavender peppermint oil and vitamin c but it wasnut working
 the child was vaccinated and had tamiflu per the mother whom you did not interview journalists like you are the reason why no one trusts the media anymore you do not report the news you make up whatever fits your personal bias and world view and pretend it is news
 i see the article trending that a colorado boy dies from flu due to mom not giving the child tamiflu ium which she was prescribed by the child doctor hot take if you didnut go to medical school or do not study medicine shut the fuck up
 good article just missing the horrendous side effects of tamiflun
 local news reported the childhad the vaccine and followed doctors instructions which was to take tamiflu  the reporter never contacted the mother  mother said nbc got the story completely wrong mob descended irrelevant that she asked for advice on a natural health website
 my daughter also had flu b last year it started with a belly ache and since i had a ruptured appendix at her age we immediately took her to the doctor she was diagnosed with the flu and prescribed tamiflu she was completely over the flu in  hours it works

 this is a horrendous tragedy but i donut understand tying it to tamiflu a pretty expensive drug that doesnut have a good performance or safety record tamiflu is in some ways an avatar of problems with our health care model flu vaccine (way more relevant here) is not
 we don't know if this boy was vaxed for flu or not we do know that his mother did give him tamiflu as directed by doctors amp; he died anyways brandy didn't bother to fact check her story the mother ended up being harassed amp; called a murderer how awful as she just lost her son
  days ago my friends son almost died from taking tamiflu it started breaking down his muscles and poisoning him still donut know what effect it will have on his kidneys rhabdomyolysis google it

 vaccinate your damn kids parents they aren't a means for you to make a political statement and believing some ignorant doctor who claimed vaccines were linked to autism (who was summarily debunked and shut down) does nothing but endanger your children 
 my kids have had the flu several times none of their pediatricians recommended tamiflu i just got the flu got tested within  hours and my doctor said nah donut do tamiflu the side effects arenut worth it  i vaccinate my kids on schedule and think mckaeighleigh is a moron

 my youngest son has the flu right now tamiflu has been a godsend for him thereus an outbreak in our area with some schools having more than  kids absent this flu strain is no joke amp; i simply cannot imagine not giving him this medicine to help alleviate his symptoms
 ah another becky  do you not comprehend what ium saying?   at least  other child deaths this season in kids who did have the shot and tamiflu  who will you blame for those deaths?  also this article says he took the meds

 i would assume child endangerment  since the tamiflu isn't actually a vaccine this would be withholding medical treatment
 someone put out a story that she did give her kid tamiflu and took him to the er multiple times and they kept sending him home and that she should sue nbc or whoever put out that article udeudduduufe0fudeudd
 thatus a super hard call to use tamiflu or not to use it a friend of mine gave it to her child i believe it was day  she got so lethargic and much sicker she told her mom her toes hurt mom looked and her toe nails they were curled up and coming off ium not for it
 for a med mal case iuve been working on iuve done a great deal of research into tamiflu studies do recommend giving tamiflu especially to the very young  very old and immuno compromised tamiflu has minimal side effects so itus always best to err  on the side of safety
 she shouldn't have been seeking medical advice and they shouldn't have been giving it  whether or not tamiflu was used isn't the issue  it's the giving of advice for a sick child who ended up dying  any way you slice it smv and fb are culpable imo
 that is unbelievable she deliberately refused to pick up the tamiflu which is yet another example of refusing recommendations by a trained medical professional and consulting her antivaxer friends from facebook university instead udeuddudcudffcuduufe0f
 i am sure the parents are devastated but i think they should go to court for child endangerment not giving your very sick kid tamiflu in favour of essential oils elderberries and potatoes? ffs
 do you mean not getting their kids a flu shot? if so i agree that's negligent unless there is a medical reason they shouldn't get onenntamiflu is only recommended for a small  of children who are at highrisk for developing serious complications or exhibiting severe symptoms
 ucshe was treating all four of her children with u including peppermint oil vitamin c and lavender u were not working and asked the group for more advice the advice that came in the comments included breastmilk thyme and elderberryudnnvaccinesworkntamiflu also has a role
 i literally cannot comprehend what it's like to be someone who thinks why don't i get medical advice got my kids from this facebook groupnnon facebook antivaxxers urged a mom not to give her son tamiflu he later died 
 if someone asked advice on if they should give their kid tamiflu and someone told them no i donut really blame facebook for that that seems like if i asked if i should go out with someone and someone said yes and i ended up murdered fb already censors antivax stuff
 tamiflu might have helped and she ignored the doc and that likely contributed to her child's demise fucking horrendous
 tamiflu trending nme 
 yeah i was wondering if she gave her child the tamiflu as the doctor recommended if he would have passed anyway i dont take my  year old to the doctor but if he had a fever that didnt break for  hours i'd take him to the hospital of course
 most people are aware that a flu shot isn't going to work instantly nor does it stop all flu  it takes a few days for it to get the body to have an immune response against flu and if you do get the flu it is wise to take tamiflu as your doctor recommends pneumonia is not flu

 antivirals like tamiflu are only prescribed when a patient is genuinely in danger of dying from the flu the amount of cases where people say nah i don't need it the doctors just overreacting and end up dead is rampant

 check out this story today about a  year old who died after antivaxxers urged his mom not to give him the tamiflu he was prescribed and use lavender and potatoes instead 
 my mother had emphysema they gave tamiflu to her she ended up with water in the lungs and swollen lips and eyes they didn't even pick it up as being the cause until i took her off it and told them they put it on her chart but twice after still tried prescribing it to her
 not defending the mother i don't know the whole story but tamiflu is awful
 the real reason tamiflu should be trending 
 and there's no way of knowing whether the tamiflu had anything to do with my slightly quicker than anticipated recovery even if it did i'd rather have had to take one more day off work than spend an entire day vomiting when i could barely lift my head
 ultimately one of her other children a fouryearold (who the doctor recommended be treated prophylactically with tamiflu) falls ill to the flu and suffers respiratory failure leading to cardiac arrest
 child abuser  featured here has  children with influenza one is an infant the other is a  year old nnshe details their misery and the fact that she took them to the dr but refused to follow through with the treatment of tamiflu that was recommended
 she did take the prescription the doctor gave her she reported it to several news stations the doctor recommended tamiflu the boy died after should the doctor be arrested? what about tamiflu makers?udeudd
 corrected? by who? has she changed her original statements regarding tamiflu?  nium not dunking this is what antivax mentality leads to ni do feel for the mother i think she was taken advantage of by larry cook amp; friends for her other kids sakes i hope she learns from this
 heartwrenching i wish this poor mom had given her son the tamiflu since it was recommended by the doctor who treated him the uantivaxx groupu have crossed the line ium an advocate of natural remedies for some illnesses but pharmaceuticals are still invaluable amp; lifesaving
 yes of course and if someone pretends to be brave attacking fish in a barrel i am also free to point out that that is not brave at all dr gunter's tweet is promoting the idea that refusing tamiflu for flu caused the child's death that's irresponsible coming from an md
 my four year old got influenza b last week and ended up having a seizure this fucking pisses me off so bad we donut have insurance right now and i still took her directly to the er where she was diagnosed and we got tamiflu i cannot imagine not giving her the medicine
 omg this is horrendous i hope she sues the shit out of if they made up this story on how she refused to give him the meds wouldnut that be defamation? disgusting tamiflu thursdaymood fridaymotivation fridaymorning 
 depends how tricky the drug is to make tamiflu was quite hard to fabricate entirely synthetically though they eventually found a way
 ium a pnp and none of the providers at my office recommend tamiflu except in specific occasions at best it shortens the course of the disease by  hours when taken within the first  hours of symptom onset and the side effect profile is quite negative just not a great drug
 thanks so much i image protecting a sv kiddo with timely tamiflu would be a common recommendation (after flu dx) zoe took it this season wo issue after recommendation by both her ped and cardio
 tamiflu is trending nbecause one vile ucjournalistud felt it was appropriate to piggy back on the death of a child after the flu telling the world the parents opted out of this panacea of potential poison ntheyure evil 
 interesting that the parents say they tried all meds the docs recommended assuming tamiflu was part of ucallud   this poor mom is probably now wishing she listened to antivaxxers 
 i also thought this was a trend about how expensive tamiflu actually is sad day for mom and son
 there are plenty of physicians who avoid tamiflu; typically symptoms resolve lt; hrs quicker wtamiflu udeudde and hallucinations but ymmv nnit would have been nice to see the posts that nbc said they saw nnlavender may be good for allergies; peppermint for fever but flu? nah
 remember that trending article about tamiflu today by nbc and the young boy who tragically died from the flu?nnthe mother says she called the hospital talked to doctors and gave her son the medicine they instructed nnthe entire nbc story was fake news 
 i'm curious how the  antivaxxers feel about this  i see you guys are pretending that you don't see it trending huh
 i wonut give my kids tamiflu honestly my doctor doesnut give it to her kids either they are other meds you can take for the flu though depending on the strain but it sounds like she may not have taken every step possible to cure her child

 the announcement came after the same panel recommended on tuesday that the prescription flu drug tamiflu (oseltamivir) should have a stronger warning label to reflect reports of bizarre behaviors and deaths among children who use the medication 
 probably depends on how sick you are my  yr old niece had a amp; b with an alarmingly high heart rate tamiflu helped keep her out of the hospital and got her symptoms under control in  hrs benefit vs risk plus easier to get adult to drink fluids than a kid

 the  year old did not die from not taking tamiflu the mother should have brought her kid to the hospital when he had a seizure end of story this has nothing to do with vaxanti vax  many drs in my area would never give a  year old tamiflu
 let me start off with my kids are vaccinated and i am completely against antivaxers ium just curious though if any of you have kids and theyuve had the flu did your pediatrician recommend tamiflu for your kids?
 tamiflu is actually trending because of this story and i wonut be surprised if the next thing we hear is the mom faces chargesnnher kids had high fevers amp; a seizure and she was turning to a scam facebook communitytragedy all the way around 
 we didnut do tamiflu for our sick kids on the recommendation of our pediatrician and another pediatrician friend thatus a pretty gray area (though the seizure does differentiate our cases)
 the doctor should have recommended the child go to the er if he was having seizures  tamiflu would likely have not saved this childus life  this entire post and article is stupid  flu shots also do not prevent the flu
 i did figure out why tamiflu is trending yikes
 lol if you don't get it let me know i can share wyou i mean tamiflu is trending hmmm 
 oh yes tamiflu is nothing when compared to the power of freaking spuds in your socks nnno amount of lavender oil will calm me of my anger when it comes to these facebook moms that think theyure an herbalist from the witcher

 the article provided states that the child was prescribed tamiflu but the mother decided not to pick it up usually when a doctor prescribes a medication itus usually within reference that the child should take the medication that was recommended by someone with a medical degree
 ium not antivax and iud recommend people not give their kids tamiflu udeuddudcudffbuduufe0f majority of the time itus prescribed too late and gives worse side effects
 dear anti vaxxersnnscrew you for making tamiflu appear under trending hobbies

 we're here in colorado my  yo had a mild type b flu last weekend and our doc said tamiflu wasn't required (kids motrin  fluids) tamiflu is only given to more severe higher risk casesso this  yo needed itnnto the antivaxxers crowdnngo fck your deza selves 
 on facebook antivaxxers urged a mom not to give her son tamiflu he later died bet all those anti abortions freak donut give a shit about parents intentionally killing their kids should be a criminal law for shit like this kids depend on parents 
 tamiflu is terrible and if you take the shit then you bound to die from it and not the actual flu donut argue with me my old friend aunt died from taking tamiflu after she was prescribed to take it
 couldnut agree more i got influenza b late last week and my dr highly recommended it ntamiflu elderberry cough pearls and ibuprofen with lots of gatorade and rest is the concoction to bounce back quicker
 tamiflu is trending because the american people have lost any sense of reality this country left sanity behind twenty miles back
 i absolutely hate that when i saw tamiflu trending i thought we was dragging tammy lasagna nagain 
 falsendoctors in hospitals prescribe tamiflu regularly especially to high risk patientsnit is an antiviral preventing replication of virus in your body amp; most effective if given shortly after exposure nif your symptoms aren't caused by influenza it won't work
 terribleuddudeb donut take flu symptoms lightly i had last weekend suffering with severe shivering and high fever leads to flu go to doctor right away take medication recommended by them tamiflu 
 my friend and her daughter suffered worse side effects from the tamiflu than the actual flu blaming the mother for a treatment that may or may not have worked is unconscionable
 ium scared to see why tamiflu is trending i just know itus gotta be due to some gwyneth paltrowstyle fuckhead saying itus evil or some dumb shit like that
 i see tamiflu trending now i know why
 utah reps now seek to censure romney for voting his consciencennrep's say they dont expect retribution by trump but want to send a messageparty loyalty of above allnndictators punish all who disagreennutah better stand by romney nntrump's mind is sick wake up americanntamiflu 
  of my kids got the flu and we caught it in time to get them tamiflu (it was awesomeuthey got better so much faster) got one friend mentioning that elderberry syrup is supposedly just as good when i posted on facebook whatever
 maybe she should have talked to your friend who says she can cure cancer with household ingredients?  udeuddn
 ugh so dumb to recommend against it that being said tamiflu isnut an amazing drug but def better than nothing
 tamiflu does not cure the flu and the side affects are horrendous
 i saw tamiflu trending and i thought people were still coming at tammy from thebachelor
 the problem with this dumb mom who didn't give her kid tamiflu is that she's gonna get funded out the ass on the when her child's death is entirely of her own doing  suspend the account
 log onto twitter and tamiflu trendinglisten ya'll need to get vaccinated and when a medical provider prescribes a med you probably should take it that kid who died might not have died and his siblings might not have become sick in the first place if they had been vaccinated
 the mother also wrote that the ucnatural curesud she was using  including peppermint oil vitamin c and lavender were not working and asked the group for more advice the advice that came in the comments included breastmilk thyme and elderberry 
 i guess it depends on the age but you said you never prescribe tamiflu to children ium guessing there are other options since there are a wide range of drugs out there
 her lavender essential oils didn't work what a fucking shock i feel terrible for her family tamiflu 
 you insensitive pricks they tragically lost a child and youure pointing your fingers uddude my own doctor says he doesnut recommend tamiflu unless someone has a health problem that puts them at risk of complications condolences to this family what an unfathomable loss uddudc
 mild side effects are worth the risk if it helps beating the flu once you have it hell the cdc says tamiflu is recommended for kids two weeks old or older directly from the  website these side effects are worth saving a life you never prescribe it? 
 saw tamiflu trending and figured maybe they had decided to use it against coronavirus nopeits a fucked up story
 who? the people who spend years studying them pediatricians do understand the benefits of vitamin c none of which include preventing complications from influenza they also know the possible side effects of tamiflunone of which are death
 the advice that came in the comments included breastmilk thyme and elderberry none of which are medically recommended treatments for the flu 'perfect iull try that' the mother respondedngod help us 
 the er my husband took my son to told him tamiflu isn't recommended unless there is an underlying medical issue but who the hell takes medical advice from people on facebook??????
 if you wanna do peppermint  lavender  etc who cares it won't hurt antbody but do it in addition to the flu shot and tamiflu
 a friend who is big into essential oils curing everything did the same thing avoided tamiflu chugged elderberries and was so thankful i have my roll on oils to get me through yeah so she just got out of the hospital because she almost died from complications and there's a
 this case didn't even involve vaccination; this child had been prescribed tamiflu which is an antiviral drug that an antivaccination group advocated against even this shows  their agenda is simply pushing snakeoil marketing even at the cost of a child's life 
 that's an important pointnso the anti vaxxers not only promote no vaccinesn but also instruct to not have their children take the tamifluni wonder how many children have died from the flu dt believing in their advicendeadly cult
 uh if the child was in that bad a condition shouldn't the doctor have immediately forwarded the child to a hospital instead of sending him home? tamiflu would have not stopped dehydration
 but wait tamiflu is not a vaccine itus a medication so antivaxxers are antipharmaceuticals now? they donut trust any medications? just potatous amp; lavender?
 the flu is for real most parents have no idea about pediatric emergency distress and spend more time on twitter than attending to children recognition of deterioration and seeking help probably would have prevented this not tamiflu
 i was enraged seeing this read the article read the gofundme the mom wouldn't give him tamiflu yet was okay with sending him to the hospital smhni'm now more enraged shut these antivaxx groups down before more children and adults die
 how was she doing things ucrightud from her perspective when she was given a doctors recommendation for tamiflu and ignored it she willingly chose to trust a facebook group over a doctor
 antivaccine group recommended mom put potatoes in his socks instead of taking tamiflu ffs nn(this precious little one passed away) nnvaccineswork believescientists vaccinateyourkids 
 the advice that came in the comments included breastmilk thyme and elderberry none of which are medically recommended treatments for the flu  via 
 this is a terrible story but tamiflu is a borderline useless medication which has far more side effects than benefits there is precisely zero clinical evidence that it reduces complications hospitalization or death in healthy patients i rarely recommend it to my patients
 sad for the family  ni donut want to muddy the waters but i donut think tamiflu is recommended for kids under ?  thatus what my daughterus physician said when my  year old grandson came down with infuenza b
 a kid died from the flu after mom asks for advice in one of the biggest antivaxx fb group they recommended to use essential oils and put potatoes in socks while the kid was having seizures  
 yup thatus the one iuve been following the story since earlier in the week when a friend showed me her original posts about avoiding tamifluignoring the febrile seizures
 i get it walk in clinic prescribed my son with tamiflu on a weekend and then pediatrician told us to stop monday morning but people asking for medical advice from randos on the internet that donut even know the situation is bonkerslevel stupid
 i'll say this as plainly as possible  if you are anti vaccinations get the hell off my friends list n
 never everyone of my friends that were forced to get it all got the flu we never needed them before you get sick? get tamiflu ride it out and get back to normal life
 i had a friend who reached out to facebook and ask if weuve given our kids tamiflu because her child had the flu i told her my family and i have used tamiflu for  consecutive seasons her child threw up after st dose so she decided not to continue udeuddudcudffbuduufe0f i mean why ask fb?
 in fairness tamiflu is the devil ium not going to recommend essential oils and potatoes though ium going to recommend fluids rest and being vigilant in making sure a kiddo stays hydrated otherwise straight to the er if kiddo is lethargic isnut using the restroom etc
 i have  fluvaccinated kids () and three came down with the flu our doctor prescribed tamiflu and we all took it i mentioned it on facebook and antivaxxer friends went nuts they told me i was poisoning my children and i'd be responsible for their deaths seriously
 pra quem tas torcendo entu00eo?
 shot in the ass and waiting to pick up my tamiflu how is everyone else spending their weekend?? 
 this isnut neglectuthis is deliberate reckless endangerment if she had followed the doctorus advice and given him the tamiflu her doctor prescribed he almost certainly would still be alive
 she had the first two kids tested for flu and the doctor prescribed tamiflu for the sick kids and also for the healthy kids to reduce their chances of getting sick she chose to use natural ucremediesud despite knowing that there was a medically recommended treatment
 it was a long weekend of fighting the flu i pull up to work; take a deep breath; turn the key to my classroom door and immediately crap my pants and pass out as my last tamiflu pill rolls out of my pocket
 first it was flu i couldn't keep water down then i'm told at carespot it's also a sinus infection a week later i'm not contagious anymore but the tamiflu has rendered me useless
 half of my kids classes have been out with the flu now itus our turn as we pick up tamiflu now itus time to shut down the schools for a long weekend amp; disinfect everything amp; allow students to have a chance to fight this epidemic shut down the flu
 my colleagues seem to be big fans of tamiflu can you recommend any peer reviewed andor authoritative papers about how itus not that great?
 i am not impressed with presumed influenza  and prescription tamiflu without a formal swabnalso no test for anything else despite convention attendancenmehni'm out of here
 a friend of mine took tamiflu once and will never take it again for two reasons  didnut help at all   was hallucinating like crazy oh and he ended up with pneumonia udeuddudcudffcuduufe0f
 really? weure still having these conversations about subgroups and theoretical benefit? well documented systematic data suppression spectrum bias and obstruction by roche thereus never been an independent trail showing clear benefit 
 cant help on tamiflu but i recommend you read the emperorus new drugs  it is about anti depressants  they donut work but the analysis is excellent fun
 my oldest has flu symptoms i got the side eye today for not taking him to the doctor getting a test and tamiflu doc visit and rx would be  amp; there are  of us he got a flu shot in octobernthen she told me that their pediatrician recommended not getting a flu shot udeudduduufe0f
 heus on the mend tamiflu is  with insurance (just fyi in case you need to save up)
 one for sure kid with influenza b and  other kids taking tamiflu for preemptive measures covering all bases here already called my doctor to see if he'll send it out to jay and i obviously trying to make sure the rest of us won't get it
 i think in maryland you're legally allowed to send a yearold out for your tamiflu prescription as long as you attach a tile tracking thing to his shoe
 did we send tamiflu over to china yet
 and gilead were behind that lifesaver sorry massive money maker tamiflu werenut they? remember that stuff supplied to europe that very largely ended up being incinerated in the gulf 
 not intended to obfuscate or confuse but admittedly i am not always able to communicate as well as i would likeuddude0nnsometimes we have evidence but its inconclusive thats my view of the lancet study does tamiflu work? from this study i dont think we can answer
 oscillococcinum uddudcaf seriously it made a huge difference for me last month with the flu otc at target or on amazon xday dissolve on tongue my whole extended family swears by it plus none of tamifluus nasty side effects gws
 yeah prescription antivirals like tamiflu may lower flu duration from  days to  days but are only recommended for people  that may face complications because ppl taking drugs to take them is one reason us healthcare is expensive zicam is otc but is for colds not flu
 if anyone needs me iull be mixing tamiflu suspension until the end of time
 prescription only itus does the job in half the time compared to tamiflu ask them to give you that good good hook my friend up thanx

 in nh we had a lot of flu cases this year at the end of january most mds stopped testing for the flu if there were symtoms and prescribed tamiflu
 outcomes need to be reported honestly like all drug trials there will be a tendency to only report the positive reporting of results must be unbiasedni hope there is a control group who are given something like tamiflu
 i also ended up vomiting on day two but assumed it was a side effect of the tamiflu which i then stopped taking nnafter my negative flu test on monday i went to a minute clinic on wednesday in hopes of getting another test
 also we have both vaccines and a antiviral drugs  ie oseltamivir aka tamiflu  to treat the flunnand flu viruses are endemic so there is at least some immunity to them in the populationnnnone of those three things apply to sarscovcovid
 so did they not buy the tamiflu? or were they not really criticized for the expenditure? which part is the propaganda?
 time of stay in hospitals nnthatus the big difference  thatus what you are asking nnif you go to er for flu you get fluids discharged in hours maybe a day with tamiflu nnif you get covid and need er you spend multiple weeks maybe a month taking a bed staff amp; vent
 i recommend trumppence team approve tamiflu nationally;
 i think that in large part depends how soon until a reliable treatment is found if we have one that lessens the effects and works fast (much like tamiflu does for the flu) then we may not need such drastic actions nnor at least that is the hope
 my doctor friends say it is analogous to tamiflu ie a tool for treating particularly bad cases not broadly useful for all cases

 covid (coronavirus) what is the recommendation regarding tamiflu use in suspected cases? i checked this on uptodate and they recommended that patients with symptoms should receive the usual care for patients with flu which seems dubious who knowsguess this?

  can i tell you i have a friend in orlando who went to the er a few days ago for flu like symptoms test came back negative but put her on tamiflu anyway fast forward  hours  she feels worse wouldnut retest for flu and refused to test for covid

 well that's america's problem with those pharmaceutical co  is it not? and side effects since i know a few friends who recovered from sars back in that pandemic a decade back they got treated with tamiflu and went through all its side effects

 oh yea we didn't say boo by spending  million on a vaccine smdh with all you guys and your total bs go get your free vaccine and take the pretreatment(tamiflu) and the known treatments that work this nonsense is so ignorant
 if your doctor prescribes you tamiflu think twice and do your research before taking i had the worst reaction and ended up in er
 remdesivir is not a definitive treatment for covid it is a stopgap measure the material i read stated that remdesivir shortened illness from  days to  days with a trend towards fewer deaths like tamiflu remdesivir is not a vaccine that prevents illness

 ium infinitely skeptical of anything that comes from gilead after tamiflu amp; itus ilk donut really believe ucshortening symptomsud was a primary end point when what we really need is fewer deaths fewer icu admits amp; intubation nfauci was incredibly irresponsibleugt;
 that's somewhat of a relief tamiflurelenzaxofluza activity looks similar more rapid reduction but end of treatment load similar to pbo  agree with your point that at  days post symptom onset viral replication is not the driver of disease
 wild warnte die politik davor ohne evidenzgrundlage weitreichende entscheidungen zu treffen und verwies dabei auf den fall des grippemittels tamiflu das zur zeit der vogelgrippeepidemie in den jahren 0 vom u00fsterreichischen staat im grou00dfen stil gebunkert wurde )
 prediction more than a few experts will be questioning the dsmb decision to stop the nih remdesivir trial with a uctrend towards significanceud in mortality and benefit seen in clinical improvement  not same but useful to revisit tamifluus ucbenefitud   
 so with remdesivir we are killing a fly with a bazooka i remember when tamiflu prices skyrocket because hn panic now viruses got resistent and tamiflu once effective against real diseases is  uselessncovid lockdownend remdesvir remdesevir
 remdesevir doesn't work on coronavirus  gilead are bullshitting after the abandonment of the st trialnnthe tamiflu  remdesevir treatment pathway which is efficacious in respect of influenza abc is a dead end obviously so in terms of tamiflu amp; analoguessubstitutes
  years ago a friend of mine wrote i'd advise all to stock up on tamiflu the government is lying  it doesn't have nearly enough supplies the london underground is a malthusian disaster waiting to happennnhe is a lot wiser now of course which is why he's still my friend
 we need this to be readily prescribed outside of the the hospital setting same as tamiflu while the us outbreak is ending itus  day cycle the ability of drs to have this as a therapeutic early in the virus is crucial to getting back to normal and preventing further outbreaks
 wow rielly sends me so many vids with her nursing lecture on in the background i'm thinkin i could be a nurse just learned tamiflu can be take profelactively
 the flu shot helps to mitigate the flu symptoms also you can take tamiflu to help end the flu in three () days the coronavirus is much more contagious and lethal eg flu killed k americans in past  weeks the coronavirus killed k in  weeks and more unknowns exist
 this seems another uctamifluud study we get another ucimproves symptomsud when we are looking for something that decreases mortality they changed the endpoints of the study  weeks ago and ucdeathud became ucimproves symptomsud
 at this pt kinda smells like tamiflu or hype re a cancer drug approved upon some dramatic improvement in a surrogate endpoint but don't show gains in os (paging ) i'm hoping there's real clinical benefit here; i just don't think it's clear if it exists yet
 also  this ainut tamiflu which maybe helps you feel better a day or so earlier the outcomes here are hospital discharge and need for oxygenation a much harder endpoint
 to my knowledge tamiflu hasnut been tried in the same trial design as remdesivir making comparison hard  but yes itus more than likely the remdesivir mortality trend is real (but quantitatively small)
 precisely why i say itus promising at least itus not hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin combo remdesivir is the farthest we have gotten remember not even tamiflu is as effective i recommend no drug if itus not needed depending on the case
 but tamiflu never showed hard outcomes benefits  just symptom reduction  ndo you see the mortality trend for remdesivir as likely real here? (p 00)
 this tweet and article is a perfect example of the intellectual laziness of the media  no one thinks that remdesivir is going to end covid anymore that tamiflu ucendsud influenza  itus a possible treatment that seems to reduce the amount of time on has covid
 depends how sick you still get even if you donut die long term health effects of covid still unknown antivirals in general only slow the infection do not cure it see tamiflu and hiv meds 
 lancet study was adequately powered to detect to the 'time to improvement' effect size reported in niaid press release but only found a nss trend and the gilead singlearm study is effectively worthless  right now we're looking at super expensive iv tamiflu
 remdevisir is zionist gilead ciezat tried push their dangerous tamiflu during the porcine flu time ;;; now learn more about fauci z fake fauci z fraud servant of hilary  see who his friends are 
 i see it like tamiflu i know the flu could very well kill me or send me into dire straits so the relative risk to people like us isn't that different tamiflu is a safety net a therapeutic for novel coronavirus would have to be seen as a similar tool
 cool your jets jimthis is as much better as tamiflu has been for flu which is to say not veryneeds early application and doesn't change the odds that greatlythis is not ending stay at home
 if remdesivir ends up being the 'tamiflu of covid' that would be great news
 yeah this is something iuve posted about before itus got to be soc in that event in effect weud need adaptive study designs if primary endpoint is  pt scale hard to know what that means until we see actual clinical data if we had a tamiflu iud be happy better w earlier
 but search remdesivir on google right now check out the news that came out  hr ago they passed the gold standard trials by the nih and niaid its equivalent to the tamiflu when swine flu came out it's a game changer even for people that wanted the lockdown extended yesterday

 standing on bended knee until fda conducts tamiflu trials; (because some may have both influenza  covid);
 i reckon a lot of it was because they got absolutely monstered for spending half  billion quid on tamiflu for an epidemic that never happened so they held off until the last minute this time
 what eventually came out is that the who recommended tamiflu without seeing underlying clinical trial data the ema amp; cdc approved tamiflu also without vetting the underlying data the cdc approved the drug based on a  page rochesponsored paper alone badpharma

 back in the days of avian flu public health england bought (from memory) u00a million worth of tamiflu made by roche  roche's record for bending the data can we accept their claims of  no false positives?
 the tamiflu fiasco it is inexplicable that despite the lack of scientifically robust data on efficacy and safety of oseltamivir reputed organizations like who cdc ema us fda not only recommended the drug  but its stockpiling as well

 hcq with zinc early in covid seems to help tremendously if given later after intubation then itus kinda worthless all anti virals are this way give tamiflu after  days of flu and wonut help etc  good points shelby
 why is everyone parroting this bs as well?nnvacuous statement probably being spread by botsnndonut focus on means focus on ends vaccine is a very long term solution and not necessary most arenut vaccinated against flu but when it gets bad we have tamiflu to reduce deaths

 a delay of days before symptoms appear after first infection? a  lack of effective drug (massive nhs stocks of tamiflu useless) a novel disease so fatalistically accepting the inevitability of being endemic in the long term not being the right response big difference to flu
 i remember having a difficult time trying to get prescriptions filled during that time because of the hoardes descending on my local pharmacy trying to get their hands on tamiflu almost none had an rx for it or any symptoms they just wanted it just in case

 seems that the early use of hydroxychloroquine might be the key isn't tamiflu for normal flu recommended in first  hours? not bowled over wremdesivir reducing recovery time from  days to  but only tested on the very ill where are tests of hydroxy given early?

 you may shorten the duration of flu by a day (eg tamiflu) or as in hep c decrease chronic infection (ifn rbv sobosfuvir)nnbut as is shown in the lancet paper the viral loads were already off peak and downtrending remdesivir had no effect via its putative mechanism

 stock piled in  and the hn plandemic hit in  udeudd with the who recommending   tamiflu 
 hey friends  save this article for when the flu comes around next fallnnin a nutshell  study finds singledose baloxavir works as well as  days of tamiflu for flun  demcastco
 so i just don't buy the exceptionalism thing because we did the imv right thing over stockpiling tamiflu (which in the end we didn't need) and the right thing over being overly cautious around ebola under a labour and a conservative government

 som pensioneret praktiserende lu00ege og med min erfaring ligner det helt almindelige influenza symptomer har vi pru00fvet behandling af covid infektionen med tamiflu i danmark? udeudd
 hab mal in den bereich gearbeitet und ewig viel zeit mit qualitu00etssicherung von tamiflu zugebrachtnextrem aufwendige synthese und der hohe bedarf hat in zeiten von hn die preise fu00fcr sternanis extrem spiken lassen
 achja das endet dann mit einem tamiflu szenario
 first now you  when will it end
 uh huh  you adore and defend hydroxychloroquine instead of tamiflu or famotidine or any other drug for no particular reason and not because you support trump?  i donut believe that for a single second
 if covid ends up like flu we might never have an effective treatment people in their s and s can still end up in intensive care with flu and all we have for that is tamiflu which is pretty useless

 agreed the purpose is to lessen the severity like tamiflu not used as a cure they just want to keep pushing the vaccine agenda
 it really matters?? not for menwhat really matters is another issuendoes hcq treatment reduces the severity of infection and the risk of progression to pulmonar and hyperinflammation phase?? thatistherealquestionntamiflu doesn't prevent flu but prevents severe evolution
 vaccines will be key to ending this pandemic  sarscov will still exist regardless of how many people wearamask it is also the only thing that will truly end the covidquarentine hopefully we'll get the tamiflu equivalent for covid_ 
 while you may accept the conclusions of a body that refuses to be open to independent scrutiny i do not you should not let your distrust of one group lead to you placing blind trust in another group we all should learn from the tamiflu fiasco
 en diciendo q no se puede llegar y recetar cualquier remedioq opina del tamiflu00fa entonces?n
 telling the difference between the effectiveness of the drug and the beginning of the end of the regular course of the disease may be difficult for patients to recognize 
 tamiflu is for influenza a and hn not for covid but omg etong steam inhalation is stupidpropaganda ng cebu city lgu even after spending million pesos on a nonfunctional warehouse aka covid isolation center now additional  million for a command covid centr
 why are people pretending that a drug that doesn't help for covid pneumonia doesn't help covid cold ? ntamiflu must be given within  hours to work ngiving your patient nothing and telling them to go to er when they can't breath even sounds crazy
 stacey thank you for this well written piece as a young hospital rep for roche i helped set up some of the early flu pandemic material as we rolled out the drug tamiflu covid is a ptsd horror story for me when it comes to friends 'surely lockdown will protect our parents?'
 why are democrats pretending that a drug that must be used early is unusual ? ntamiflu must be used within  hours
 nwhy do we have to die? nwhy are you pretending it is unusual for a drug to be used early to work ?  tamiflu must be used in  hoursn
 i still contend that why did we get the data that we got from tamiflu studies on outpatients?   lessening the disease by  day hardly seems beneficial or helpful either but doctors prescribe it all the time during flu season    hard to tweet when more needs to be said
 independent laboratory testing conducted by hong kong university school of public health demonstrates that tamiflu does not have any antiviral effect on the novel coronavirus roche manufacturer of of oseltamivir
 you get fhe flu  tx tamiflu steroid possibly cough syrup  you still have fhe flu and feel like shit  maybe end up in er if sick enough  why not use hcq? neven if there is a chance to feel better with covid  makes no sense  steroids are not good for you but they rx them
 you still donut seem to comprehend that there is a difference between vaccines which are tailored to specific dna chains in a specific virus and antiviral treatments like tamiflu that attack entire virus families both sarscov and sarscov are (surprise) the same family
 iud even go as far as to say that the health professionals who are refusing to administer this hcq cocktail are also to be labelled murderersnnthe fact that this idiot govt is ready to spend millions on useless vaccines proves theyuve learnt nothing from the tamiflu debacle
 and they didn't ban tamiflu or (hcq) or send sick people to nursing homesuufe0f faucithefraud
 it depends on when you take like tamiflu early in the process
 perhaps because it's intended to be administered at the onset of the virus not after being admitted to the hospital? kind of like tamiflu which is taken at the beginning of flu symptoms not after it's in full swing let the doctors who are doing their jobs do their jobs
 wait isn't that shifting the goalpost? i was only addressing the claim that earlyuse was a pivot if it was claimed by defenders from the beginning it was not a pivot (and many antiviralseg tamiflu work only on first days so there is plausibility to the claim)
 the clinical trial where they waited until the patient was severely ill or the one where they gave four times the recommended dosage which was toxic?  both were set up to fail on purpose this drug cocktail has drs all over the world reporting success if given early ie tamiflu
 waarom heeft who richtlijnen over antigriepmiddelen laten schrijven door mensen betaald door producenten zonder dit bekend te maken waarom zo heimelijk en onmogelijk te informeren wie zitting hadden in commissie? who is ideale partner geweest voor wangedrag roche () tamiflu

 yea i have always believed in leronlimab but here so many folks are investors in cytodyn so they have different agenda i just want to understand is this antibiotics quality drug v tamiflu both approvedbut tamiflu is close to placebo while the others changed the world

 i also wonder if that  million vaccs purchase was some kind of settlement payoff because they felt this scam was coming to an end; that is what happened with tamiflu afternall
 totally agree we will be stuck doing retrospective publications about survival effects or expert opinion as you well know tamiflu is now recommended for all hospitalized patients with flu (no rct)
 every single one of the patients transferred to my icu in new york had received this combo of meds your friend was one of the lucky ones nntry to think of any other treatment thatus so hyped up and politicized tamiflu? clot busters? any abx? nlet the studies show the truth
 gibt noch restbestu00ende die mit tamiflu eingelagert wurden
 another thread wevidence information supporting the use of hcq used early like tamiflu is for early treatment of the flunimo it's criminal even murder for physicians to not prescribe hcq if it's in the best interest of the patient amp; they're doing it for a political agenda 
  i should've been more clear but limited space the employees have a political agenda and are the ones making guidelines that favor their investors(tamiflu example) not all research they have agendas
 if fauci didn't panic when it seemed that hcq was effective enough to make a vaccine pointless he might not have funded the remdesivir trial and then declared it soc even though it flopped gilead has failed with tamiflu  remdesivir but it has friends and will thrive

 because there's no antiviral treatment that can be administered early at home maybe? there's been a largescale effort to develop a vaccine but is anyone developing a medication similar to tamiflu that can reduce the effects of the virus so they don't end up in hospital?

 then how about we deal with the nih recommendation to not treat positive people until they are hospitalized get the flu virustake tamiflu within  hours to prevent multiplication of the virus get coronavirusnah we'll wait till you need oxygen 
 i remember sitting in a crowded cafe having lunch with a friend who was telling me about tamiflu no masks no shutdowns no cdc bullshit

 we all have high hopes that a safe and effective covid vaccine will be introduced soon so we can finally put an end to this public health nightmare but as the tamiflu saga shows blind belief in corporate pronouncements is inherently risky

 look up tamiflu (swine flu) vaccine injuries amp; deaths lol spent millions and ended up throwing away the stock 
 also the vaccine alone wonut do anything because youure gonna have to vaccinate the majority of the population for this to end a medicine like tamiflu for hn is more important imo
 disponibili per analisi indipendenti verrano solo pubblicati i dati elaborati dai laboratori delle aziende che producono il vaccino ma i dati nudi e crudi sono importanti vedere quello che successe col tamiflu  anni fa

 who recommended tamiflu but had not vetted the underlying datanema approved tamiflu but had not vetted the underlying datancdc encouraged the use amp;stockpiling of tamiflu based on manufacturer funded pooled analysis of  clinical trials also by not vetting the underlying data

 that's not true friend went to er w  fever  coughing etc told he had flu amp; given tamiflu not tested sisinlaw's mother ()had stroke in hospital for  days before she amp; her husband (who they let stay) were tested for covid both are positive she's in icu he's home
 ok how about this? anyone who has ever touted a theory about or treatment for covid on social media if they get sick will be treated only with their previous recommendations you say it's the flu? tamiflu hydroxychloriquine works? you'll find out fake news? so are you sucka

 detecting tamiflu like benefits would require a large scale clinical trial for the outpatient protocols to examine fornn) faster recoverynor n) reduced hospitalization risk nnrx likely needs to start early in viral replication which may mean symptom onset while pcr pending
 i'm cautious incase it's like the tamiflu vaccine for swine flu that one had a few nasty side effects and some friends were unfortunate enough to get joint problems due to it so since i'm in the low risk group for covid theres others where even so it's worth it so st for them

 some clown on said of the coronavaccine we can trust the people who recommend it really? the same companies amp; 'experts' who told us that 'tamiflu' vaccine was effective and safe? a 'treatment' that inflicted neurological damage and proved useless
