 i started at  quit at  because i started taking wellbutrin and the urge to smoke decreased to such a degree i figured i should use it i didnut even plan to quit i had some mild craving but it went away quickly itus been  years and iuve never wanted to go back
 yes well i did it thru wellbutrin but not everyone likes that i hope to never smoke again plan to never smoke again itus as bad as nutrasweet andbother chem poisons go super healthy maybe find a nonsmoking med that works for u  i did
 when i first started trying to get help  i had a notinsurance plan that had a limited formulary they gave me wellbutrin first and i had a terrible ragey reaction to it there was some reluctance to prescribe controlled substances iirc which is dumb and also a major pain
 itus probably wellbutrin i got lucky that it was covered under my plan as itus one of the most effective antidepressants itus just not covered under  of plans
 i take wellbutrin and i donut plan to ever go off again iuve tried going off all meds several times even years at a time i wonut choose that again because itus terrible i agree that you have to be careful and pay attention to your body with side effects

 i am a monster i have the implant and have never been so hormonalemotionalmood swingy taking an antidepressant (wellbutrin) definitely helped while i was still on it though

 also no longer used as the source of shikimic acid for tamiflu (they are now using ecoli fermentation i believe) good because roche made the price of star anise crazy butalso see vinca alkaloids and all taxanes in cancer treatment for why plants are good for medicine
 itus easy to assume plants are irrelevant in modern medicine but they still play a vital rolennfor example one of the drugs being used to treat covid is oseltamivir (aka tamiflu)nnthis is synthesised from shikimic acid a naturallyoccurring substance found in star anise

 tamiflu just helps with the symptoms never heard of a death related to the medication theoretically at risk for anaphylaxis but that risk is there from any medication or food or plant 
 you do know star anise is the main ingredient in tamiflu??? a pharmaceutical? and that most drugs today are synthesized through plant extracts also food is pretty damn important especially for someone immunocompromised there are food you should and shouldnut eat for a reason
 members of the group are planting fake stories claiming she did give her kid tamiflu they are also deleting intertactions from her off the group
 yes the body must metabolize tamiflu for it to function it makes sense that complete plant extracts would have more synergy than a synthesized version
 yw thereus so much to say about the discourse right now i think the polarity between clinical vs natural is quite reductive especially considering how much pharma (like tamiflu) relies on plantfungi medicine to be synthesized we need to examine things as they actually are
 tamiflu sucks but shilohs transplant team literally told me i have to give it to him if he gets the flu ugh even the pharmacists i used to work for hated it lol
 i hope sheus happy with her decisions i guess using tamiflu was worse than planning a funeral because thatus what sheus doing now 
 a special strain of ecoli bacteria is now used to make shikimic acid through fermentation and accounts for  of production nnscientists are working to improve the fermentation process but from what i gather plant sources are still the majority of extraction to make tamiflu

 is there a real treatment plan? like with the flu they give people tamiflu what antibiotics combinations have they found that are most successful?
 no it doesnut but it does free up a test for someone with no explanation for their critical illness you can still take precautions without a test (they are the same for flu and covid) the management is the same too (tamiflu is garbage) how would your management change? 
 i plan to begin a petition to the fda to approve tamiflu;

 more evidence that public institutions can work well with the govt with pandemic and disaster planning anyone remember hn after sars? your mom telling you to get tamiflu? thatus why the cathedral had masks 
 that's  masks per person this is actually good planning for a company but he should have donated them before now during the avian flu scare people bought masks and companies bought masks and tamiflu for their employees does zuck have tamiflu stocked up?
 after  many companies were compelled by their insurance brokers to implement business continuity plans then came sars so we added pandemic plans bought a ton of tamiflu and surgical and  face dust masks check in with defense contractors uddude0e
 after  they set up business continuity plans to make their insurance companies happy then added pandemic planning to it after sars  they bought huge supplies of masks and tamiflu and let them sit on shelves

 if you actually read our pandemic plan the flu vaccine plays a key part that's why i said at the beginning that an influenza pandemic plan is not enough for covid covid does not have a vaccine nor antivirals (tamiflu)

 i worked for roche in  during the hn scare they made tamiflu so we had a lot of insight into pandemic planning i think companies cities states etc have plans in place but executing pandemic plans requires information and coordinated effort and we arenut seeing that
 ps if they find an antiviral that works on this virus plan on running out and needing a rush order we run out of tamiflu during bad flu epidemicsnnactually that goes for iv bags iv equipment oxygen administration devices etc just because they are theregt;
 fair as well but i think another likely explanation is they adjusted based on the subgroup analysis from the lancet data  neither trial notably changes mortality nnsmells like tamiflu
 the fact of the matter is that the flu is normal and just like the flu covid will become the new normal we will develop a treatment plans sort of like the tamiflu and a vaccine that many people wonut get
 staranise fruit is the global source of shikimic acid adn the constiuent in tamiflu; shikimik migh help prevent covid; skikimic acid (tamiflu) is found in many plants and herbs;

 the natural element in tamiflu is skikimic found in plants;
 shikimic acid is found in star anise; dill and other plants; shikimic acid is the priority ingredient in tamiflu;

 bush did a lot for america's pandemic planning founding the national stockpile of tamiflu  via 
 tamiflu has only moderate success amp; requires use early in infection amp; we've spent much longer researching influenza planning on a magic antiviral to come along is unrealistic amp; a vaccine candidate may come in fall or in  locking down the country for  years is not serious 
 yes  the lack of both a vaccine and anti virals is a massive risk  flu pandemic planning in this regard doesnut work  we have a secret warehouse full of tamiflu for a flu pandemic  no good here as you say 
 the federal government actually decided since by the time they decided it was a problem it was too late for containment that routine flu precautions and tamiflu was the only plan did not work out that well donut know about having models but if they did knew wasnut overwhelming
 usually a national stockpile such as the tamiflu stockpile is planned for these scenarios yet it appears that the government overlooked this particular risk
