"RESULTS: After 4- to 14-month period of therapy with the combination of <e1>indapamide</e1> (2.5 mg/day) and fosinopril (10 mg/day) in three patients and 6-month period of monotherapy with <e1>indapamide</e1> (2.5 mg/day) in one patient, glucose levels of all patients increased and achieve criteria of <e2>diabetes</e2> diagnoses."

"CONTEXT: Previous investigators have reported <e1>discrepancies between hematologic, marrow morphologic, and cytogenetic responses</e1> to <e2>imatinib mesylate</e2> among patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)."

"Our findings suggest that significant <e1>progression of marrow reticulin fibrosis</e1> during <e2>imatinib</e2> therapy can be an indicator for a return or progression of CML and, in some patients with CML, <e2>imatinib</e2> may promote cytogenetic clonal evolution, resulting in a poor response to treatment."
