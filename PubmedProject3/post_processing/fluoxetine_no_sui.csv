Abstract: Fluoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) that is commonly prescribed for major depressive disorder (MDD). Akathisia is one of the well-recognized extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) of antipsychotics and antiemetics, but also a rare manifestation of antidepressants. There are various documentations of EPS of antidepressants including acute dystonia, Parkinsonism, and tardive dyskinesia. Akathisia is not only a rare extrapyramidal manifestation of fluoxetine but a frequently unrecognized phenomenon in those using this medication. This case report describes a case of akathisia observed in a 69-year-old Caucasian female using fluoxetine. Various factors that may have contributed to the development of akathisia in this patient were also discussed as well as implications for clinical practice and future research.

Abstract: Self-injurious behavior (SIB) can be described as an act involving self-inflicted destruction of tissue, right away or over a period of time. Patients with epilepsy have to deal with an often chronic and unpredictable disorder leading to adversity in many psychosocial variables such as employment, stigma, and overall quality of life. The above factors contribute toward SIB in these patients. Behavioral problems occurring in people with epilepsy can range from aggressiveness, mood fluctuations to SIB. We report a 23-year-old male, married, educated up to 10

Abstract: Treatment resistant restless legs syndrome (RLS) in the setting of psychiatric comorbidities can be difficult to manage. Our patient is a 69-year-old Caucasian gentleman with bipolar disorder type I, unspecified anxiety disorder, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and treatment-refractory RLS. At initial presentation, the patient's prescribed medication regimen included fluoxetine 40 mg daily, gabapentin 800 mg in the morning and 3200 mg at bedtime, pramipexole 0.375 mg daily, lamotrigine 200 mg daily, trazodone 200 mg at bedtime, and temazepam 15 to 30 mg as needed for insomnia and RLS. Over the course of nearly 4 years, treatment interventions for this patient's RLS included: cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, discontinuation of exacerbating medications, switching dopamine agonists, use of pregabalin and iron supplement. This report demonstrates a challenging case of RLS in the setting of psychiatric comorbidities, development of augmentation, and polypharmacy.

Abstract: Catatonia is a psychomotor syndrome that presents with severe symptoms which can lead to dangerous and lethal conditions if not diagnosed and treated properly. SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus that can occur in severe cases with acute pneumonia, ARDS, sepsis and septic shock. In these cases, ICU admission is necessary.
A 59-year-old Caucasian man with septic shock and bilateral interstitial pneumonia from SARS-CoV-2 and schizotypal personality disorder presented with catatonic behaviour manifested by soporous state, response to intense painful stimuli with opening of the eyes, execution of simple verbal commands, maintenance of the same position, catalepsy, immobility, rigidity and mutism. At the same time, there were symptoms of septic shock and catatonic symptoms causing greater difficulty in the correct formulation of the diagnosis. During the course of his hospitalization, he was treated with asenapine 20 mg/day. The catatonia responded rapidly and significantly to the asenapine.
To date, the pathophysiology of catatonia is unclear and few guidelines are available for the treatment of catatonia. In the literature, studies have reported the efficacy of benzodiazepines such as lorazepam and diazepam, GABAA agonists such as zolpidem, NMDA receptor antagonists such as memantine, antidepressant SSRIs such as fluoxetine and paroxetine and antipsychotics such as olanzapine, clozapine and aripiprazole. We demonstrate that the antipsychotic asenapine is also effective in treating catatonic symptoms in psychiatric disorders.
Asenapine produced a rapid and significant reduction in catatonic symptoms in our patient with schizotypal personality disorder.

Abstract: Hyponatremia is a frequent, yet often unrecognized result of water intoxication caused by psychogenic polydipsia in patients with psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and anorexia nervosa. The consequences of hyponatremia may include cerebral edema with tonic-clonic seizures and, in extreme cases, death. In cases of hyponatremia seen in psychiatric practices, the use of psychotropic drugs is often necessary to address both the underlying psychiatric problem and reduce the hyponatremia. Therefore, a patient's clinical condition, the risk of side effects, the possible effect of the medication on hyponatremia and a history of prior medication use should be considered when selecting appropriate psychotropics. The present clinical case details the beneficial effects of olanzapine and fluoxetine in treating a patient with anorexia nervosa and body dysmorphic disorder experiencing acute hyponatremia, and the stable effect the medications achieved over a period of 2.5 years of maintenance therapy.

Abstract: Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is associated with co-morbid psychiatric symptoms (disruptive behavior, anxiety, mood disorders, and psychosis) often requiring psychotropic medications. In this clinical case series of 35 patients with PWS, pharmacogenetic testing was obtained to determine allele frequencies predicting variations in activity of cytochrome (CYP) P450 drug metabolizing enzymes 2D6, 2B6, 2C19, 2C9, 3A4, and 1A2. Results were deidentified, collated, and analyzed by PWS genetic subtype: 14 deletion (DEL), 16 maternal uniparental disomy (UPD) and 5 DNA-methylation positive unspecified molecular subtype (PWS Unspec). Literature review informed comparative population frequencies of CYP polymorphisms, phenotypes, and substrate specificity. Among the total PWS cohort, extensive metabolizer (EM) activity prevailed across all cytochromes except CYP1A2, which showed greater ultra-rapid metabolizer (UM) status (

Abstract: Congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS) are genetically determined heterogenous disorders of neuromuscular transmission. We report a rare mutation of COLQ causing CMS in an Asian man that remarkably improved with fluoxetine. A 51-year-old Sri Lankan man with slowly progressive fatigable muscle weakness since eight years of age, presented with type 2 respiratory failure that required mechanical ventilation in the acute crisis and subsequent home-based non-invasive ventilation. His birth and family histories were unremarkable. On examination, he had limb girdle type of muscle weakness with fatigability and normal tendon reflexes with no ocular or bulbar involvement. DNA sequencing revealed a pathogenic homozygous mutation in COLQ gene: ENST00000383788.10:exon16:c.1228C>T:p.R410W, the first report in an Asian. Treatment with fluoxetine resulted in remarkable improvement and regain of muscle power and independence from assisted ventilation.

Abstract: To describe a patient with Sjögren syndrome (SS) associated with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
Case report and systematic review of the literature.
A 40-year-old female patient with a history of xerostomia and xerophthalmia initiated in 2015. She also had a history of changing her behavior, and she practices rituals, recurrent obsessions, and compulsions. She was diagnosed with OCD. She was treated with fluoxetine associated with risperidone and then was changed for aripiprazole 10 mg/day. Cognitive-behavioral therapy was also applied. She had good control of the obsessions with these drugs and psychotherapy. Laboratory tests showed positive antinuclear antibodies, anti-Ro/SS-A, and-La/SS-B antibodies. Schirmer test, break up time, and positive green lisamin were all positive. Scintigraphy and ultrasound of salivary glands were positive. A diagnosis of Sjögren syndrome was determined. She was treated with HCQ, vitamin D3 50,000 IU/week, omega-3 2 g, and artificial tears with a good response. Currently, 5 years later, the patient is asymptomatic and has OCD under adequate control even without drugs.
This case illustrates a rare case of a patient with SS who evolved with OCD.

Abstract: Olanzapine is a second-generation antipsychotic (SGA) that has been shown to promote disease remission in persons with treatment-resistant depression when used in combination with fluoxetine. However, tolerability of treatment augmentation with SGAs may be limited because of common adverse effects, such as weight gain, hypertriglyceridemia, and elevated glucose. Data exist pertaining to rare localized edematous reactions or angioedema with use of SGAs, but diffuse whole-body edema has yet to be documented. A 47-year-old white female with treatment-resistant depression presented with a 5-day history of weight gain and swelling of her torso and extremities. Five days prior, she had initiated olanzapine/fluoxetine 6/50 mg daily following failure of fluoxetine 40 mg daily monotherapy. The patient was noted to have gained 3.6 kg since her last appointment and exhibited profuse pitting edema on her forearms, lower limbs, hands, and chest. Olanzapine/fluoxetine was discontinued and the patient was prescribed a 3-day course of a loop diuretic for symptomatic management. A follow-up visit 5 days later noted complete resolution of symptoms. Because of the temporal relationship of symptoms with initiation of olanzapine, we recommend monitoring for edema with initiation and/or titration of therapy.

Abstract: Slow-channel congenital myasthenic syndrome is an autosomal dominant inherited progressive neuromuscular disorder caused by abnormal gating of mutant acetylcholine receptors in the neuromuscular junction. Its pathological hallmark is selective degeneration of the endplate and postsynaptic membrane due to calcium overload. Pyridostigmine should be avoided in this syndrome, being quinidine or fluoxetine the current recommended therapies.
An 11-year-old girl with a limb-girdle phenotype of slow-channel congenital myasthenic syndrome presenting with a slowly progressive fatigable weakness at the age of 8 years. After a clinical worsening with pyridostigmine, empirically started before the exome sequencing results were available, a dramatic and sustained response to ephedrine monotherapy was observed. Whole exome sequencing revealed a de novo heterozygous mutation in CHRNB1 gene: c.865G>A; p.Val289Met (NM_000747.2). An abnormal decrement in amplitude (23.9%) from the first to fifth intravollley waveform was revealed after repetitive peroneal nerve stimulation at low frequencies. In addition, a second smaller compound muscle action potential after the peak of the main M-wave in median, ulnar and peroneal motor nerves was observed.
Favorable responses to adrenergic agonists added to fluoxetine had been reported. However, to the best of our knowledge this is the first report on effective monotherapy with ephedrine in a slow-channel congenital myasthenic syndrome patient. Adrenergic agonists may be considered as a therapeutic option in patients with this syndrome.
Respuesta clínica y neurofisiológica a la efedrina en un paciente con síndrome miasténico congénito de canal lento.
Introducción. El síndrome miasténico congénito de canal lento, o síndrome de canales lentos, es un trastorno neuromuscular progresivo hereditario, autosómico dominante, causado por una activación anormal de los receptores de la acetilcolina en la unión neuromuscular. La alteración histopatológica característica es la degeneración selectiva de la placa terminal y la membrana postsináptica debido a la sobrecarga de calcio. La piridostigmina debe evitarse en este síndrome, y la quinidina o la fluoxetina son las terapias recomendadas actualmente. Caso clínico. Niña de 11 años con un fenotipo de cinturas de síndrome miasténico congénito de canal lento que presenta debilidad y fatiga lentamente progresivas desde los 8 años. Tras un empeoramiento clínico con piridostigmina, iniciado empíricamente antes de que los resultados de la secuenciación del exoma estuvieran disponibles, se observó una respuesta espectacular y sostenida con efedrina en monoterapia. La secuenciación del exoma reveló una mutación heterocigota de novo en el gen CHRNB1: c.865G>A; p.Val289Met (NM_000747.2). El estudio electromiográfico con estimulación repetitiva en el nervio peroneo mostró una disminución anormal en la amplitud (23,9%) y también la génesis de un segundo potencial de acción muscular compuesto más pequeño después del pico de la onda M principal en los nervios motores mediano, cubital y peroneo. Conclusión. Aunque se han documentado respuestas favorables a agonistas adrenérgicos en asociación con la fluoxetina, ésta representa la primera aportación que documenta una respuesta clínica relevante con efedrina en monoterapia en un paciente con síndrome miasténico congénito de canal lento. Los agonistas adrenérgicos pueden considerarse una opción terapéutica en pacientes con este síndrome.

Abstract: This report describes a case of major depressive disorder with peripartum onset in a 24-year-old African-American female who was admitted to the inpatient psychiatric facility after a suicide attempt. The patient demonstrated what we will describe as heralding symptoms during the birth of her second child, but her symptoms dramatically worsened one month prior to her admission with the birth of her third child. The patient presented with anxiety and depressive symptoms, including decreased energy, disrupted sleep patterns, and emotional lability. At the time of her admission, the patient had failed treatment with bupropion, which had been prescribed by her obstetrician. During her stay, the patient was treated with fluoxetine and participated in group therapy sessions. The patient gradually exhibited improvement in her depressive symptoms during the course of her six-day stay. At the time of discharge, the patient's depression was adequately managed with her medication regimen, and she was eager to be reunited with her newborn child. This case highlights the idiosyncratic nature of major depressive disorder with peripartum onset and the need for providers to tailor the treatment to the patient's need.

Abstract: Stiff-person syndrome (SPS) is a neurologic disorder characterized by muscle stiffness, rigidity, and muscle spasms, and it can increase a patient's risk for falls. It is recognized as a rare disease with limited clinical guidelines to manage the condition and its symptoms. Currently, there is even less clinical guidance for the management of common comorbid conditions in these patients. This patient case report aims to evaluate the efficacy of various medications for symptom management in a patient with SPS and comorbid psychiatric disorders, specifically bipolar I and panic disorder. Throughout the patient's course of treatment, various medications were trialed, including fluoxetine, hydroxyzine, valproic acid, propranolol, and clonazepam. Ultimately, fluoxetine, hydroxyzine, and propranolol were discontinued due to adverse drug reactions and incomplete symptom resolution. The patient's bipolar I disorder was adequately managed with valproic acid. Once the clonazepam was changed from as-needed to scheduled dosing, the patient's panic disorder and anxiety-triggered spasms were well controlled. The efficacy of benzodiazepines, specifically high doses of diazepam, in alleviating muscle spasms and anxiety in SPS has been demonstrated in the literature. Case reports including patients with SPS that are prescribed selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors provide controversial evidence as some studies report exacerbation of SPS symptoms with prolonged use. As this case report and literature review suggest, patients with SPS and comorbid panic disorder and anxiety-triggered spasms may benefit from the use of benzodiazepines. The use of other medication classes for the treatment of other comorbid psychiatric disorders in a patient with SPS is lacking evidence.

Abstract: Paediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococci (PANDAS) are important neuropsychiatric disorders in childhood. Streptococcus pyogenes infection associated with tics, obsessive-compulsive disorders, and chorea co-occurrence is important. Swedo et al. have increased the awareness of this situation since 1998. How streptococcal infections give rise to this condition is not clear yet, but the severity of the symptoms is reduced by the treatment of streptococcal infections is important. Eight-year- nine-month-old girl presented with complaints of a 2-year history of upper respiratory tract infections and increased severity of blinking of eyes, throat cleaning, tic disorder and obsession with hand cleaning. In addition, choreiform movements were present and fluoxetine did not improve the symptoms. The patient was followed-up and treated with PANDAS pre-diagnosis. Streptococcus treatment and prophylaxis decreased the patient's complaints. A six-year-four months old boy, admitted with abnormal hand and body movements, which increased severity after the school period, and causing deteriorated fine motor skills during infectious periods for two years. There were also complaints with vocal tics and obsessive-compulsive disorder in the form of throat cleaning. Treatment of S. pyogenes was administered in throat culture. After the penicillin prophylaxis, the complaints decreased. In this study, two patients were presented with choreiform movements, obsessive-compulsive disorder and tic disorder due to follow-up PANDAS diagnosis. PANDAS should be considered in children with neuropsychiatric disorders, especially symptoms associated with infection periods.

Abstract: Extrapyramidal side effects of psychotropic medicines are usually experienced by patients in the first few weeks of initiating therapy. Patients stabilized on these medications who present with distressing complaints akin to akathisia may be triggered by other factors. This report presents two cases of drug-drug-induced akathisia. Case A is a patient with schizophrenia who was being managed with risperidone 2 mg tablet daily for the past 3 years. She fell ill and reported to a nearby clinic where she was prescribed ciprofloxacin and artemether/lumefantrine tablets for the treatment of an infection and malaria. She presented 7 days later to her psychiatrist with complaints of restlessness, tremor, palpitations, insomnia, and resurgence of obsessive thoughts. Case B is a patient who was diagnosed with first-episode psychotic depression and admitted for 10 days. Her medications on admission were fluphenazine decanoate 25 mg depot injection once, olanzapine 10 mg tablet daily, and fluoxetine 20 mg capsule daily. On discharge, ciprofloxacin 500 mg tablet every 12 hours for 5 days and fluconazole 150 mg capsule once were added to her medications for the treatment of a urinary tract infection. She reported back to the hospital a day after discharge with complaints of restlessness, "seizures," tremor, abdominal discomfort, and weight gain. Both patients were diagnosed with akathisia using ICD-10 classification and the Barnes akathisia rating scale and managed with anticholinergics, benzodiazepines, and beta blockers. Other measures employed in managing the akathisia included reducing the dose of the antipsychotic and/or switching antipsychotics. Despite these management measures, the symptoms of akathisia persisted and only resolved after 4weeks. Upon the resolution of symptoms, Case A continued treatment on olanzapine 5 mg tablet daily and fluoxetine 20 mg capsule daily while Case B continued treatment on risperidone 2 mg tablet daily and fluoxetine 20 mg capsule daily. Using Naranjo's adverse drug reaction causality assessment scale, Medscape drug interaction checker, and literature review, a possible and probable case of drug-drug-induced akathisia was made for Case A and Case B. This report is to create more awareness about psychotropic-antimicrobial-induced akathisia. The information underpins the need for health professionals to consider adverse drug-drug interactions as the probable cause of extrapyramidal side effects experienced by patients on antipsychotics.

Abstract: Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) may be induced by atypical antipsychotic drugs (AAPDs) such as aripiprazole, olanzapine, risperidone and quetiapine, either as a single treatment or in combination with other drugs. A case of NMS following the administration of lamotrigine, aripiprazole and quetiapine in a patient with bipolar disorder, and with renal failure caused by toxic lithium levels has not been reported.
A 51-year-old female patient with a 27-year history of bipolar disorder, being treated with lithium, fluoxetine, olanzapine, gabapentine, perazine and biperiden, was admitted to the hospital due to depressed mood and delusions. A urinary tract infection was diagnosed and antibiotic therapy was initiated. After 5 days of treatment her physical state deteriorated and she developed a fever of 38.4 °C. Her laboratory results revealed a toxic level of lithium (2.34 mmol/l). Acute renal failure was diagnosed and the lithium was withdrawn. After stabilization of her condition, and despite her antipsychotic treatment, further intensification of delusions and depressed mood were observed. All drugs being taken by the patient were withdrawn and lamotrigine and aripiprazole were initiated. Due to the insufficient effectiveness of aripiprazole treatment and because of problems with sleep, quetiapine was added, however further treatment with this drug combination and an increase of quetiapine to 400 mg/d eventually caused NMS. Amantadine, lorazepam and bromocriptine were therefore initiated and the patient's condition improved.
This case report indicates that concurrent use of multiple antipsychotic drugs in combination with mood stabilizers in patients with organic disorders confers an increased risk of NMS development.

Abstract: The increasing incidence of allergies and allergic reactions among children and adults has become a major public health concern. The etiology of allergic reactions can often be confirmed based on a detailed history and supportive testing. However, there are cases where the underlying factors are more complex and difficult to identify.
Here we present the case report of a 14-year-old Caucasian  girl with weight loss and a 3-year history of reported angioedema culminating in five intensive care unit admissions over the course of 2.5 months. Her initial clinical presentation included hypotension, dyspnea, and reported facial edema, but allergy and immunological workup were negative. A psychiatric workup identified an eating disorder with food restriction, comorbid major depression, obsessive compulsive disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder. A close collaboration between Adolescent Medicine, Allergy and Immunology, and Psychiatry helped disentangle medical from psychiatric problems, including fluoxetine medication effects, as well as develop a treatment plan that was acceptable to the family. The angioedema was ultimately diagnosed as factitious disorder.
This patient's treatment highlights the importance of a multidisciplinary team approach, a multifactorial etiology that needed to be addressed by multiple specialists, and the importance of long-term treatment and support.

Abstract: Fluoxetine is a pharmacological agent that has been widely used to determine the neurotransmission of serotonin in the central nervous system. It is the drug of choice in the treatment of depression due to its safer profile, fewer side effects, and greater tolerability.
This is a case of a 30 year-old woman suffering from mild depression according to the DSM-V criteria who had been prescribed and administered fluoxetine in a dose of 20 mg p.o./per day.
Six weeks after the initiation of the medication, the patient reported hair loss in the frontal area of the skull.
Since fluoxetine is a widely used antidepressant, clinicians should be aware of the skin complications in patients treated with antidepressants. There is further need for therapeutic monitoring in everyday clinical practice and before the prescription of an antidepressant agent, the specific guidelines, side-effect profile, drug-drug interactions and most current indications should always be taken into consideration.

Abstract: Kyle is a 10-year-old boy with Down syndrome and intellectual disability who is being followed up by a developmental behavioral pediatrician for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and anxiety. Kyle was initially taking a long-acting liquid formulation of methylphenidate for ADHD and fluoxetine for anxiety. Several months ago, the liquid formulation was on back order, and the methylphenidate formulation was changed to an equal dose of a long-acting capsule. Kyle is not able to swallow pills; therefore, the contents of the capsule were sprinkled onto 1 bite of yogurt each morning. Over the course of the next month, Kyle's behaviors became increasingly difficult. He was not able to tolerate loud or crowded places, and despite a visual schedule and warnings, he would become aggressive toward adults when directed to transition away from preferred activities. Fluoxetine was increased from 0.4 to 0.6 mg/kg/day at that time.One month later, his parents reported that although there may have been slight improvement in Kyle's irritability since the increase in fluoxetine, they felt he was nonetheless more aggressive and less cooperative than his previous baseline. Kyle was returned to the long-acting liquid formulation of methylphenidate at that time, and a follow-up was scheduled 2 weeks later.On return to clinic, his parents reported that Kyle's behaviors had continued to become increasingly difficult. He was described as uncooperative and aggressive at home and school. Kyle was easily upset any time he was not given his way, his behavior was corrected, or he felt that he was not the center of attention. When upset, he would yell, bite, kick, spit, or throw his body to the ground and refuse to move. At 110 pounds, Kyle's parents were no longer able to physically move his body when he dropped to the ground. This was a safety concern for his parents because he had displayed this behavior in the parking lot of a busy shopping area. Because of Kyle's aggressive and unpredictable behavior, parents no longer felt comfortable taking him to public places. Family members who had previously been comfortable staying with Kyle while his parents were out for short periods would no longer stay with him. Overall, the behaviors resulted in parents being unable to go to dinner as a couple or provide individual attention to their other children. The parents described the family as "on edge." How would you approach Kyle's management?

Abstract: Serotonin syndrome (SS) is a potentially fatal complication of treatment with various serotonergic agents. It is diagnosed clinically and consists of cognitive, autonomic, and neuromuscular dysfunction. Although serotonin syndrome has been known to induce seizures, there are no reported cases of electroencephalogram (EEG)-documented status epilepticus (SE) associated with serotonin syndrome. We report a case of serotonin syndrome and status epilepticus in a patient thought to have overdosed on both fluoxetine and bupropion in the setting of alcohol intoxication. Our patient required aggressive treatment with various anticonvulsant medications to control status epilepticus and was also treated with cyproheptadine for the serotonin syndrome. This paper will also discuss the contributing factors of fluoxetine and bupropion to this presentation in the context of alcohol intoxication.

Abstract: Myoclonus dystonia is a rare movement disorder that often causes significant disability. Deep brain stimulation of the internal pallidum (GPi DBS) is a recommended treatment for those who do not respond to pharmacotherapy or who have intolerable side effects. This paper reports on the case of a 17-year-old male who was admitted to a tertiary level mental healthcare facility for treatment of psychiatric and behavioral symptoms thought to be related to GPi DBS. Prior to GPi DBS insertion, the patient was diagnosed with anxiety and mild obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). Following insertion, his OCD became severe and he developed depression, Tourette syndrome, and stuttering. His first admission to a psychiatric unit was for management of a manic episode following treatment for depression with fluoxetine, and he began to exhibit severe aggressive behavior. GPi DBS was turned off, but there were neither changes in dystonic movements nor improvement in aggressive behavior or psychiatric symptoms, though stuttering improved. The patient was transferred to a secure treatment centre where he was able to gain control over his behaviors with intense dialectical behavior therapy, but the aggressive behavior and safety concerns continue to persist today.

Abstract: Erotomania is a delusional phenomenon in which patient believes that some celebrity is in love with her. It is associated with various psychiatric illnesses. We herein present a report of a young woman with erotomanic delusion diagnosed with recurrent depression, current episode being severe with psychotic features. A 22-year woman, previously treated for a depressive episode three years ago, was brought by the mother for evaluation. The woman presented with symptoms of depression for the past six months along with the delusion that famous singer SY is in love with her for the past two months. This has resulted in a gross decline in social and academic functioning. Psychometrics revealed Beck's depression inventory (BDI) score of 36 and brief psychiatric rating scale (BPRS) score of 41. A diagnosis of recurrent depression with current severe episode with psychotic features, was made at our psychiatric facility. This case report highlights that psychotic depression can present with a rare mood incongruent delusion of erotomanic content and accurate diagnosis and management require adequate knowledge about this phenomenon.

Abstract: Children and adolescents with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) can present in atypical and unusual ways. We present the case of a 13 year old boy with an unusual presentation of OCD. He presented with irritability, aggression, poor sleep, reduced attention, hyperreligiosity, social withdrawal and disinhibition (i.e. inappropriately touching females) for 1 week and was found to have obsessional thoughts and impulses related to sex and the compulsion of seeking absolution from lord buddha. He was diagnosed as OCD after excluding organic causes, manic episode, acute psychotic episode, drug induced psychosis and sexual abuse. He initially responded to fluoxetine 20mg, olanzapine 2.5 and a short course of lorazepam. He was functioning well for 2 weeks and thus olanzapine and lorazapam were tailed off. A week later he presented with similar symptoms with the added symptoms of singing, masturbating in public and talking excessively to his mother about sex. He was found to have obsessional thoughts, impulses and images and the compulsions of reassurance seeking from his mother and seeking absolution from lord buddha. He responded to an increase in fluoxetine to 40mg and olanzapine 2.5mg. He has now remained in remission for 4 months with good functioning. This case shows that in contrast to adults, children may not recognize that their obsessional thoughts are irrational and may not be able to resist the obsessions as a result. It stresses the importance of being mindful of the atypical presentations of OCD in children to avoid misdiagnosis.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex disease that is often treated with dopaminergic medications such as carbidopa-levodopa and now with innovative interventions such as deep brain stimulation (DBS). While PD frequently presents with depression and apathy, research must elucidate whether its treatment modalities have an additive or synergistic effect that can lead to an increased suicide risk. DBS has been associated with depression, behavioral changes, and suicidality while dopaminergic treatment has also been shown to cause behavioral changes such as hypersexuality and impulsivity. Considering the now frequent practice of utilizing both DBS and carbidopa-levodopa to treat PD, it is crucial to understand how to properly manage PD patients who are displaying this overlap in symptomology.
A 56-year-old Caucasian male with a 6-year diagnosis of PD who was being treated with high dose carbidopa-levodopa and left DBS of the ventral intermediate nucleus (VIM) presented after a suicide attempt. The patient was found to be severely depressed and had exhibited behavioral changes in the weeks leading up to the attempt. Imaging was performed to assess positional changes of DBS and carbidopa-levodopa dosage adjusted while under close observation in the inpatient unit. The patient was started on fluoxetine to treat the depressive symptoms and was eventually discharged with close monitoring.
With PD and DBS being associated with behavioral changes and depressive symptoms and carbidopa-levodopa therapy being linked to behavioral changes such as impulsivity, it is important that these patients be closely monitored and research analyzes how these factors may interact and lead to an increased risk of suicide. Furthermore, when symptoms appear, a clear protocol must be established on managing these patients. We therefore recommend an approach that utilizes imaging to assess any changes in DBS placement, dose management of carbidopa-levodopa, and behavior monitoring in an inpatient setting.

Abstract: Paroxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) with several indications, one of which is for depression. We present a case of probable paroxetine-induced serotonin syndrome.
A 21-year-old female with a history of generalized anxiety disorder and major depression presented with increased depressive symptoms over several months while taking fluoxetine 20 mg daily. Fluoxetine was discontinued without taper and replaced with paroxetine 10 mg daily, along with hydroxyzine 50 mg twice daily as needed for anxiety. Within a week of starting the paroxetine, the patient reported increased anxiety, insomnia, and constant shaking. The paroxetine continued to be uptitrated over a 3-week period to a dose 30 mg due to unremitting depressive symptoms. One month later, the patient presented with tachycardia, generalized body aches, extreme fatigue, weakness, uncontrollable twitching, tremor, and hyperreflexia. A widespread burning sensation accompanied by random hot flashes without diaphoresis was also noted. Serotonin syndrome was diagnosed using the Hunters criteria. Paroxetine was discontinued, and the patient's physical symptoms resolved within a week.
To date, only 5 cases of serotonin syndrome have been reported in patients receiving SSRI monotherapy at recommended therapeutic doses.

Abstract: Maggie is a 16-year-old girl who came to see me because she wanted help with her longstanding difficulties falling asleep at night and waking up in the morning. She goes to bed between midnight and 3 am and usually lies awake worrying until falling asleep at 3 to 4 am. She often video-calls or texts her boyfriend before sleep. Her wakeup time is 8 am; she typically wakes exhausted, having slept 4 to 5 hours. Although a good student, she is often late for classes. On weekends, she wakes around noon. She is tired, anxious, and demoralized. She cannot concentrate as well as she did prior to the onset of her sleep symptoms at age 10 to 11 years. Her psychiatric history includes a diagnosis of anxiety and depression, both in remission, treated with fluoxetine 30 mg daily for several years. Difficulties falling asleep and waking in the morning are common complaints among adolescents and young adults. Before my additional year of training in sleep medicine, I would have misdiagnosed Maggie as having insomnia rather than delayed sleep phase disorder (DSPD), a circadian rhythm disorder.

Abstract: Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) are the first-line treatments for various psychiatric disorders. SSRIs offer an improved side effect profile compared to older treatments, which improves patients' adherence and quality of life.
Here we discuss a case of an uncommon, but a distressing side effect of citalopram. A 76-year old woman was referred to the psychiatry clinic for bizarre behavior. The patient was diagnosed with behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia and was started on citalopram 20 mg and aripiprazole 5 mg daily. At 3.5 months the patient complained of diffuse hair thinning on her scalp. Citalopram was considered the offending agent and was discontinued. Within a few months, the patient regained most of her hair. Although drug-induced alopecia is common among other SSRIs, it is relatively rare with citalopram.
Early recognition, withdrawal of offending agent, and reassurance to the patient that hair loss is reversible can help alleviate patient distress and avoid relapse.

Abstract: Cerebral autoregulation is the mechanism by which constant cerebral blood flow is maintained despite changes in arterial blood pressure. In the two presented cases, cerebral autoregulation was impaired in patients with narcolepsy type 1, and both venlafaxine and fluoxetine may have the potential to improve the impaired cerebral autoregulation. A relationship may exist between impaired cerebral autoregulation and neurological symptoms in patients with narcolepsy type 1.

Abstract: Lesion-based investigations of psychopathology have preceded contemporary network-neuroscience initiatives. However, brain-lesions detected in routine psychiatric practice are often considered incidental and therefore ignored. Here, we illustrate a strategy to combine individual subject-level lesion information with open-source normative functional-connectomics data to make putative, neuroscience-informed symptom interpretation. Specifically, we report a patient with left precuneus granulomatous lesion and seizures followed by two distinct symptoms - kinetopsia and delusions of nihilism and guilt - which had a differential treatment response. The lesion-based brain-mapping approach could identify correlated (default-mode) and anti-correlated (temporo-parieto-occipital) networks, which enabled a neurobiological formulation of these diverse clinical manifestations.

Abstract: BACKGROUND Historically, clinical researchers have underestimated the prevalence and importance of musical obsessions, which are defined as intrusive, repetitive, persistent sounds or tunes, not controlled by the will, that cause clinically significant anxiety and distress. Musical obsessions have also been described as the "stuck song syndrome" and their prevalence is not clearly established, because few cases have been reported. CASE REPORT This study reports a case of a 32-year-old female with a history of musical obsessions over the course of 12 years. She suffered episodes in which she heard repetitive musical fragments in her head, such as the chorus lines or portions of known or unknown songs, that caused high levels of anxiety in her daily life. The symptoms led her to introduce compulsive behaviors such as listening to the song that matched with the obsessive song. Treatment with fluoxetine 60 mg/day for 12 weeks reduced obsessive symptoms by 60%, improving her quality of life. CONCLUSIONS This case allowed us to explore the semiological spectrum that encompasses musical imagery, in which concepts that belong to normality are involved, such as musical imagination, involuntary musical imagery, and sticky songs, and other concepts that deal with psychopathological aspects such as musical obsessions, musical hallucinations, and palinacousis. Additionally, the case showed us an atypical form of compulsion that accompanied musical obsession, in which the patient sought to complete the obsessive content with real music. Treatment with fluoxetine 60 mg/day generated a symptomatic response but not remission of symptoms.

Abstract: Extrapyramidal adverse effects of antipsychotic drugs are more reported in children. Biperiden is an anticholinergic agent to treat the adverse effects of antipsychotic drugs. The drug has the potential to induce delirium at toxic doses. However, data are scarce about delirium associated with biperiden in children. Thus far, a case of delirium has been associated with biperiden in an adolescent patient. We report the first case of delirium associated with the use of biperiden in a preadolescent patient.
A boy aged five years and weighing 20 kilograms had been diagnosed as having oppositional defiant disorder and separation anxiety disorder in the previous treatment center. Ten milligrams fluoxetine and 0.25 milligrams risperidone had been initiated. On the third day of treatment, dystonia developed and he was administered with biperiden. An hour later, he was brought to our emergency clinic due to disorganized speech and behavior. His vital signs were stable. There were no findings in blood and urine tests. No electrolyte imbalance, liver, kidney, and thyroid dysfunction have been observed. His neurologic examination was unremarkable and no abnormal findings were shown on cranial magnetic resonance imaging. No other system findings or findings pointing out to infectious diseases have been observed. One milligram physostigmine was administered with intravenous infusion. However, symptoms did not resolve and he was diagnosed with delirium. Naranjo Adverse Drug Reaction Probability Scale score was seven, indicating a "Probable" Adverse Drug Reaction. Half milligram haloperidol was administered bid for three days and he was discharged with complete recovery.
Clinicians must be aware of the risk of delirium when using non-toxic doses of biperiden in young children.

Abstract: A 14-year-old young adult took an overdose of 1.2 g of fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) that he had been prescribed for depression. He had a generalised tonic/clonic seizure at 6 hours postingestion.After the seizure, he developed signs consistent with serotonin syndrome: fine tremor, agitation, sweating and hyperreflexia. This was followed by severe muscle pain and rhabdomyolysis with peak creatine kinase (CK) of 33 941 at 74 hours. He was managed with intravenous fluids and analgesia and discharged after 4 days, having avoided renal injury. The use of SSRI's such as fluoxetine in teenagers has increased in recent years. While it is generally considered benign in overdose, this report illustrates the severe consequences of overdose at high quantities and discusses appropriate management in these cases. We note that in this case, there was a delayed onset of rhabdomyolysis with peak CK at 74 hours postingestion.

Abstract: Drug-induced liver injuries (DILI) are overall rare and often associated with use of medications. Medications are also the most common aetiology of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), but SJS is seldom seen concomitantly with liver injury. Many common drugs can cause either one of these conditions; however, there are no reported cases of concomitant DILI and SJS secondary to fluoxetine.
A 41-year-old female presented with a skin rash and abnormal liver function tests after the recent initiation of fluoxetine. Skin and liver biopsies showed features of SJS and DILI, respectively. Fluoxetine was stopped, following which there was improvement in her liver function tests and skin rash, without progression to fulminant hepatic failure.
Commonly used and safe pharmaceuticals such as fluoxetine have the potential for serious adverse events affecting the skin and liver.

Abstract: Cognitive, affective, and sleep disturbances can be found in patients with Huntington's disease (HD), and medications used to treat these HD-related sequela can also impact HD-related movement disorders. We present the case of a 52-year-old Caucasian man with previously undiagnosed HD who exhibited significant choreoathetoid movements that improved with discontinuation of fluoxetine and lisdexamfetamine upon hospital admission. Following diagnosis of HD through genetic testing, he was administered 5mg of oral melatonin on two consecutive evenings, which resulted in worsening choreoathetosis. We calculated Naranjo adverse event scores of 5, 5, and 2 for fluoxetine, lisdexamfetamine, and melatonin, respectively, based on our assessment, review of outpatient medical records, and available literature. We review the literature surrounding these possible adverse drug events and their mechanisms regarding dopaminergic modulation in early-middle stages of HD. Our report indicates that caution should be exercised when initiating psychostimulants, fluoxetine, and melatonin in patients with early-middle stage HD. Screening for HD might be warranted for patients who develop choreoathetosis after initiation of the aforementioned medications. We recommend ascertaining baseline level of chorea before initiating these medications in patients with known HD and closely monitoring for exacerbation during therapy.

Abstract: Metoprolol (a CYP2D6 substrate) is often co-prescribed with paroxetine/fluoxetine (a CYP2D6 inhibitor) because the clinical relevance of this drug-drug interaction (DDI) is still unclear. This review aimed to systematically evaluate the available evidence and quantify the clinical impact of the DDI.
Pubmed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library and Embase were searched for studies reporting on the effect of the DDI among adults published until April 2018. Data on pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and clinical outcomes from experimental, observational and case report studies were retrieved. The protocol of this study was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42018093087).
We found nine eligible articles that consisted of four experimental and two observational studies as well as three case reports. Experimental studies reported that paroxetine increased the AUC of metoprolol three to five times, and significantly decreased systolic blood pressure and heart rate of patients. Case reports concerned bradycardia and atrioventricular block due to the DDI. Results from observational studies were conflicting. A cohort study indicated that the DDI was significantly associated with the incidence of early discontinuation of metoprolol as an indicator of the emergence of metoprolol-related side effects. In a case-control study, the DDI was not significantly associated with bradycardia.
Despite the contradictory conclusions from the current literature, the majority of studies suggest that the DDI can lead to adverse clinical consequences. Since alternative antidepressants and beta-blockers with comparable efficacy are available, such DDIs can be avoided. Nonetheless, if prescribing the combination is unavoidable, a dose adjustment or close monitoring of the metoprolol-related side effects is necessary.

Abstract: Fluoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) commonly used in the treatment of depression. While most intoxications with SSRI's have favorable outcomes and do not require interventions other than strict observation of vital signs and heart rhythm, clinicians should be aware of the life-threatening complications that may occur.
A 61-year-old woman presented to the emergency department after an intentional multiple drug overdose. Upon examination, she was somnolent with stable respiration and hemodynamics. Electrocardiography showed a prolonged QTc interval of 503 ms. The patient was admitted to the ICU for cardiopulmonary monitoring. During admission, the patient remained stable and showed improved neurologic function over time. After 22 h, a second ECG showed normalization of the QTc interval to 458 ms. However, 36 to 40 h after admission, our patient developed recurrent episodes of Torsades de Pointes (TdP) with loss of cardiac output, leading to cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Spontaneous circulation was restored after intravenous administration of magnesium sulphate. Retrospective serum analysis revealed fluoxetine concentrations of 2700 mcg/l.
Most intoxications with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) have favorable outcomes and do not require medical interventions other than strict cardiopulmonary observation. However, higher doses have been associated with QTc interval prolongation, TdP, serotonin syndrome, and death. This case illustrates that life-threatening complications may occur late in the course of hospital admission. Even though overdoses with SSRI's generally result in few fatalities, clinicians should be aware of the life-threatening clinical manifestations that may occur. Despite being an imperfect predictor of imminent TdP, continuous monitoring of cardiac rhythm is strongly recommended when either cardiac or non-cardiac symptoms are present.

Abstract: A 24-year-old woman with symptoms of major depressive disorder and anxiety had been treated for the condition since the age of 17. Symptoms were resistant to fluoxetine and then citalopram. Following the birth of her daughter, she wanted to be medication-free and symptom-free. A programme of weekly open (cold) water swimming was trialled. This led to an immediate improvement in mood following each swim and a sustained and gradual reduction in symptoms of depression, and consequently a reduction in, and then cessation of, medication. On follow-up a year later, she remains medication-free.

Abstract: To date, little research has examined the effectiveness of either modified Family-Based Therapy or psychopharmacological treatments for patients diagnosed with avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID), and there is little evidence to guide clinicians treating children and adolescents with ARFID. This case series describes the clinical presentations, treatments and outcomes of six patient diagnosed with ARFID who were treated sequentially by a child psychiatrist and adolescent medicine physician in a hospital-based eating disorder program.
Five out of six cases were female and median age of patients at assessment was 12.9 (
These cases illustrate the complex ways in which young patients with ARFID can present, the illness' effect on development and mental health, and the positive outcomes associated with weight gain and concurrent treatment for co-morbid anxiety disorders.

Abstract: Amenorrhea, oligomenorrhea, galactorrhoea, gynecomastia, infertility, and sexual dysfunction may arise as a consequence of hyperprolactinemia. Hyperprolactinemia is one of major side effects of treatment with antipsychotics, but aripiprazole is known as a dopamine stabilizer antipsychotic which can be used to improve hyperprolactinemia. In this report, it was described that an adolescent patient experienced amenorrhea after adding very low dose aripiprazole to ongoing fluoxetine treatment regime for major depressive disorder. Additionally, this case showed that the patient recovered from the amenorrhea with replacement of aripiprazole with quetiapine.

Abstract: Skin-picking disorder is regarded as a type of obsessive-compulsive and related disorders according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are reported to be effective in the treatment of skin-picking disorder. However, these agents can cause opposite effects in some cases. There is a report on SSRI-induced skin-picking disorder in adults. However, to our knowledge, there are no data regarding SSRI-induced skin picking in children. We present the case of a preschool girl with separation anxiety disorder who displayed skin-picking and compulsive-asking behaviors after fluoxetine therapy.

Abstract: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is defined by the copresence of two core symptoms: alteration in social communication and repetitive behaviors and/or restricted interests. In ASD children and adults, irritability, self-injurious behavior (SIB), and Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorders- (ADHD-) like symptoms are regularly observed. In these situations, pharmacological treatments are sometimes used. Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors- (SSRI-) based treatments have been the subject of several publications: case reports and controlled studies, both of which demonstrate efficacy on the symptoms mentioned above, even if no consensus has been reached concerning their usage. In this article four clinical cases of children diagnosed with ASD and who also present ADHD-like symptoms and/or SIB and/or other heteroaggressive behaviors or irritability and impulsivity treated with low doses of fluoxetine are presented.

Abstract: Fluoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor that is commonly used in children and adolescents. Several reports exist regarding the relationship of fluoxetine use and sleep bruxism. We report the case of a 6-year-old girl who was successfully treated with once-nightly dosing of buspirone for fluoxetine-induced sleep bruxism, which was confirmed with clear on-off-on treatment sequence.

Abstract: BACKGROUND Serotonin syndrome is a condition characterized predominantly by neuromuscular symptoms and altered thermoregulation in response to serotonergic overtone. Treatment is focused on withdrawal of serotonergic agents, which leads to resolution in the majority of cases. In the setting of serotonergic overdose, the onset of serotonin syndrome is usually within 4 to 13 h. Here, we report a case of delayed-onset serotonin syndrome in a patient who ingested a mixture of longer-acting serotonin agonists with serotonin antagonists. CASE REPORT A 24-year-old male was transferred to our medical intensive care unit with hypotension and altered mental status after an overdose of fluoxetine, cyproheptadine, trazodone, olanzapine, risperidone, and bupropion. After approximately 72 h, the patient developed symptoms of fever, lower leg clonus, hyperreflexia, and agitation. He was diagnosed with delayed-onset serotonin syndrome, which responded well to re-administration of cyproheptadine, leading to resolution of symptoms by day 5 of his stay. CONCLUSIONS In this present case, our patient presented with the longest reported delay in the onset of serotonin syndrome after intentional ingestion. This was likely secondary to co-ingestion of long-acting serotonin agonists with protective shorter-acting serotonin antagonists (cyproheptadine and olanzapine). Clinicians should consider delayed-onset serotonin syndrome when patients ingest longer-acting serotonergic agents with serotonin antagonists.

Abstract: Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare autosomal recessive disease due to copper metabolism disturbance. The clinical presentation spectrum of Wilson's disease is wide and initial findings of the disease depend on the organ involved. Neurologic disorders can develop insidiously or precipitously with intention tremor, dysarthria, rigid dystonia, Parkinsonism, deterioration in school performance or behavioral changes. This article is presenting an 11-yr old boy with chief complaint of falling and upper limb spasm. He referred to the Neurology Department, Ghaem Hospital, Mashhad, northeastern Iran in 2016. His symptoms began from 6 months earlier as mood instability (prolonged spontaneous crying). He was also suffering from occasionally tremor and micrographia. Initial investigations were normal and with diagnosis of depression and psychiatric problems, he had undergone treatment with fluoxetine and risperidone. Wilson's disease should be considered in the diagnosis of all children with psychiatric and musculoskeletal symptoms.

Abstract: Outside the context of overdose and serotonin syndrome, seizures and myoclonic movements attributed to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are rare and poorly documented. We present a 77-year-old man, with no history of epilepsy, presenting in the emergency department with whole body jerks since that morning. Two days earlier, due to a prescription mistake, he was started on paroxetine 20 mg instead of his usual fluoxetine 20 mg. The patient's electroencephalogram (EEG), performed in the emergency department, revealed a bilateral synchronous parieto-occipital fast spike activity pattern, which correlated consistently with negative myoclonus. Two days after stopping paroxetine, the patient presented no seizures and no abnormalities in the EEG. We present an EEG documented case of drug-induced seizures, with a bilateral parieto-occipital pattern, secondary to paroxetine intake. A hyperexcitability of the primary somatosensory cortex inhibiting primary motor cortex output could explain the electroclinical correlation.

Abstract: Serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are generally considered safe drugs but fatal adverse effects do sometimes occur, often as a consequence of interactions with other serotonin active drugs. Polypharmacy is usually a problem that the elderly encounter, but it can also have dire consequences for young people, especially when an underlying heart condition is present. Thus, failure to diagnose heart disease and the use of contraindicated medications can be a lethal combination, irrespective of age. Here we present a case of a young adult suffering from bipolar disorder who used a combination of two SSRIs (citalopram and fluoxetine) and a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAO; moclobemide) with tragic consequences. The deceased also suffered from undiagnosed hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and was carrier of a genotype that may have predisposed him to increased sensitivity to SSRIs. The apparent difficulty in establishing the manner of death in this case is also discussed.

Abstract: DOK7 congenital myasthenic syndrome (DOK7-CMS) generally presents early in life and is treated with salbutamol or ephedrine. This report describes an atypical case of a 39-year-old woman who presented with proximal upper limb weakness in the third trimester of pregnancy and was initially diagnosed with seronegative myasthenia gravis. Dramatic clinical worsening under pyridostigmine and further inefficacy of steroids, intravenous human immunoglobulin (IVIG) and plasma exchange (PLEX) led to the presumptive diagnosis of a CMS. Initially, a slow-channel CMS was regarded as more probable due to prominent finger extension weakness. Accordingly, fluoxetine was started and a lengthy improvement was seen. Clinical deterioration occurred after fluoxetine withdrawal, when a c.1124_1127dup homozygous mutation was detected in DOK7 gene. Afterwards, salbutamol was started and the patient became asymptomatic. This case highlights the importance of considering CMS before an adult-onset myasthenic syndrome and suggests a benefit from fluoxetine not previously reported in DOK7-CMS.

Abstract: This case report details the treatment of an early adolescent already receiving treatment for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder who presents with recurrent obsessive-compulsive disorder. Potential atomoxetine (Strattera) and fluoxetine (Prozac) interactions via Cytochrome P450 (CYP450) pathways are examined and alternate therapies are recommended.
Provide a discussion of psychopharmacogenomics, especially in the case of combining medications, CYP450 enzymes, and clinical implications in the context of the burgeoning field of precision medicine. The following questions are addressed: 1) What are the recommendations for pharmacogenetics testing? 2) How should pharmacogenetics inform medication selection? 3) What impact should CYP450 knowledge have on medication dosing?
Peer-reviewed journals, U.S. Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Medical Library, and the Clinical Pharmacology database.
Genetic testing as a prescriptive tool is not indicated for all medications; however, potential drug-drug interactions, narrow therapeutic drug index, and side effect toxicity contribute to the need for testing. An understanding of CYP450 metabolism and drug interaction as well as metabolism phenotypes should inform prescribing and dosing psychotropic medications.

Abstract: Drug-induced prolongation of the corrected QT interval (QTc) may lead to serious and potentially life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmia, such as torsades de pointes (Tdp), which is worthy of clinical attention. Here, we report 1 case of Tdp after a coadministration of fluoxetine and amiodarone.
A 62-year-old Chinese male who placed with the implanted cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) appeared the QTc prolongation and Tdp after the concurrent administration of fluoxetine and amiodarone.
Torsades de pointes (Tdp).
The patient was treated with magnesium and potassium immediately. Her ICD-brady pacing mode was reprogrammed to 90 bpm. Meanwhile, both of fluoxetine and amiodarone were discontinued.
The further episodes of Tdp were prevented. After a few days, the QTc gradually decreased without clinically significant arrhythmias.
The present case demonstrates that a potential drug-drug interaction (DDI) may lead to a life-threatening drug adverse reaction (ADR) especially in special subjects. Therefore, clinicians should closely monitor the electrocardiogram (ECG) when QTc-prolonging agents are given to patients with cardiac abnormalities, and avoid combining 2 QTc-prolonging drugs.

Abstract: A 10-y-old cranially implanted rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) involved in visual research was presented for dull mentation and weight loss. Physical examination revealed alopecia and poor body conditioning, and bloodwork revealed marked hypercortisolemia (23 μg/dL). Differential diagnoses for hypercortisolemia, weight loss, and alopecia included Cushing and pseudo-Cushing syndromes. To further evaluate hypercortisolemia, we compared the urine cortisol:creatinine ratio (UCCR) at baseline and after low-dose dexamethasone suppression (LDDS) testing in the presenting animal and healthy naïve and implanted working monkeys. At baseline, UCCR was 10 times higher in the presenting macaque (118.1 ± 7.1) than in naïve animals (12.5 ± 12.8) and 3 times higher than in healthy implanted working macaques (44.4 ± 6.9); however, levels were suppressed similarly by dexamethasone in both the presenting animal and healthy controls. In addition, healthy implanted working macaques had significantly higher baseline UCCR levels than naïve controls, suggesting chronic stress in working animals. Abdominal ultrasonography and radiographs of the presenting animal revealed marked bilateral adrenal mineralization but no overt adrenal tumor or hyperplasia. Overall, these results excluded endogenous Cushing syndrome and prompted us to evaluate different causes of pseudo-Cushing syndrome, including depression. Using videorecordings to evaluate behavior, we used published criteria for macaque models of depression models, including huddling, to make a presumptive diagnosis of depression. The macaque was treated with fluoxetine (2 mg/kg PO daily), provided increased environmental enrichment, and followed over time by regular UCCR assessment and videorecordings. The animal improved clinically and behaviorally, and UCCR returned to levels observed in working implanted macaques (44.4) after 8 wk of treatment. This case highlights the potential effect of research-related work on stress and pathologic behaviors in macaques and demonstrates the utility of UCCR and LDDS for screening behavioral and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal abnormalities in these animals.

Abstract: Management of severe vasoplegic shock in overdose can be very challenging. We describe a case of severe refractory vasodilatory shock in poisoning where methylene blue (MB) was used with success. However, the patient subsequently developed severe Serotonin Syndrome (SS) as a result of an interaction between serotonergic drugs and MB.
A 15-year-old male developed severe vasoplegic shock 1.5 hours after overdosing on several different medications including quetiapine slow release, quetiapine immediate release, desvenlafaxine slow release, venlafaxine, amlodipine, ramipril, fluoxetine, promethazine and lithium. His vasoplegic shock was resistant to high doses of noradrenaline and vasopressin. MB was administered 6.5 hours post ingestion and within 1 hour there was an improvement in his hemodynamic status and reduction of catecholamine requirements. Twelve hours post ingestion, he developed severe Serotonin Syndrome that lasted 5 days as a result of interaction between MB, a reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAO-I), and the antidepressants taken in overdose. MB had a calculated half-life of 38 hours.
MB is a useful additional strategy for severe drug induced vasodilatory shock and may be potentially life-saving. Clinicians should be aware that it can interact with other drugs and cause life-threatening Serotonin Syndrome. Lower doses or shorter durations may be wise in patients at risk of this interaction.

Abstract: Common side effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) include tachycardia, drowsiness, tremor, nausea, and vomiting. Although SSRIs have less toxic side effects compared to more traditional antidepressants, serious and life threatening cases of SSRI overdose have been reported. We describe a 24-year-old multimorbid female who presented to the emergency department with rapid onset ascending sensorimotor paralysis, complicated by respiratory and cardiac arrest, found to have fatal levels of fluoxetine by toxicological analysis, not taken in a suicidal act.
Autopsy was performed at the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner's Office of a female with no evidence of traumatic injury. Toxicological analysis revealed lethal levels of fluoxetine, toxic levels of diphenhydramine, and multiple other coingested substances at nontoxic levels. Neuropathological examination of the brain and spinal cord revealed no evidence of Guillain-Barre paralysis.
Lethal levels of fluoxetine and multiple potential drug-to-drug interactions in our patient likely contributed to her unique signs and symptoms. This is the first case reporting neurologic signs and symptoms consisting of rapid onset ascending sensorimotor paralysis, hearing loss, respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, and death in a patient with lethal levels of fluoxetine.

Abstract: The aim of this study was to use Descemet's Stripping-automated Endothelial Keratoplasty (DSAEK) as a novel treatment to remove thioridazine corneal deposits. A 53-year-old female presented with a 3-month history of visual loss and glare. She had been taking thioridazine (100 mg/day for 1 year) for a psychiatric disorder. Dense yellowish-brown deposits had developed in the posterior stroma. Thioridazine was discontinued, and she was switched to fluoxetine. One year after discontinuation of thioridazine, her symptoms and signs did not resolve. Standard DSAEK was performed on her left eye. Two weeks after DSAEK, an anterior subcapsular cataract was detected in the same eye. Phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation were performed after 3 months. The left cornea became completely clear after DSAEK, and the patient's best-corrected visual acuity improved from 20/40 to 20/20 at 1 month after cataract surgery. All-visual symptoms such as glare and halos improved postoperatively. We suggest that DSAEK can be used as a novel treatment to reduce vision problems caused by thioridazine-induced corneal deposits.

Abstract: Antidepressants are routinely used by General Practitioners (GP) as well as Psychiatrists to treat Depression. They are tolerated well. However, in certain patient populations, they are associated with SIADH (Syndrome of Inappropriate Anti-Diuretic Hormone Secretion) and Hyponatremia. Various research studies have shown that all antidepressants are associated with Hyponatremia. Hyponatremia as a side effect of antidepressant therapy is more commonly seen in old age, chronic Kidney disease and Hypothyroidism. Untreated Hyponatremia could lead to life threatening emergencies including Cerebral oedema, brain damage and coma. In this article, the authors discuss a 63 year old patient who suffered from Bipolar Disorder Type 2. He was treated with antidepressants (mainly Paroxetine) on and off for 30 years, without much side effects, until 2014. In July 2012, he underwent subtotal colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis as a management of adeno carcinoma of Colon. In April 2013, Paroxetine was stopped as he was well. He developed first episode of mania in July 2014. This was managed with Olanzapine. However, he soon developed a Depressive episode and severe Anxiety. He was restarted on Paroxetine and the dose was increased up to 50 mg along with Olanzapine 15 mg per day. As he did not improve, he was switched to Sertraline with which he developed Hyponatremia. Further to this, he was tried on Venlafaxine and Lofepramine and he developed Hyponatremia with both of them. Considering the severity of Depression, he was started on Mirtazapine and the dose was titrated to 45 mg. With this dose his serum Sodium levels were stable but his Depression persisted. Fluoxetine augmentation at this stage by the GP led to another episode of Hyponatremia. Hence, he was started on Aripiprazole 5 mg as an augmentation agent. His Depression improved reasonably (though he did not remit fully). Recently, he has been started on Vortioxetine and the dose has been titrated to 15 mg OD and in addition, he is on Mirtazapine 45 mg OD and Aripiprazole 5 mg OD. His Sodium levels have been stable and his Depression has improved. This is the first time we have come across a patient with colectomy developing severe Hyponatremia. In this article, we have discussed possible reasons for Hyponatremia following colectomy and the management strategies that could help.

Abstract: : Abnormal inter- and intraspecies aggression, perceived to be anxiety related, was identified in two male red-necked wallabies (Macropus rufogriseus) housed within a zoo. Aggressive episodes were directed at conspecifics, other exhibit animals, and, in one case, human caretakers. The clinical use of oral fluoxetine (0.5 mg/kg po bid) for a period of approximately 4 mo was effective in eliminating aggression towards humans and other animals in these two individuals. There was no evidence of recrudescence of aggression in either case following discontinuation of therapy for up to 3 yr posttreatment. Other than a period of mild transient sedation in one animal, side effects were not noted with fluoxetine treatment in these cases. Additional studies on the pharmacokinetics and side effects of fluoxetine treatment for anxiety behaviors are warranted in wallabies.

Abstract: Long-term effects of neglect in early life are still widely unknown. Diversity of outcomes can be explained by differences in genetic risk, epigenetics, prenatal factors, exposure to stress and/or substances, and parent-child interactions. Very common sub-threshold presentations of children with history of early trauma are challenging not only to diagnose but also in treatment.
A Caucasian 4-year-old, adopted at 8 months, male patient with early history of neglect presented to pediatrician with symptoms of behavioral dyscontrol, emotional dysregulation, anxiety, hyperactivity and inattention, obsessions with food, and attachment issues. He was subsequently seen by two different child psychiatrists. Pharmacotherapy treatment attempted included guanfacine, fluoxetine and amphetamine salts as well as quetiapine, aripiprazole and thioridazine without much improvement. Risperidone initiated by primary care seemed to help with his symptoms of dyscontrol initially but later the dose had to be escalated to 6 mg total for the same result. After an episode of significant aggression, the patient was admitted to inpatient child psychiatric unit for stabilization and taper of the medicine.
The case illustrates difficulties in management of children with early history of neglect. A particular danger in this patient population is polypharmacy, which is often used to manage transdiagnostic symptoms that significantly impacts functioning with long term consequences.

Abstract: Perioperative use of serotonergic agents increases the risk of serotonin syndrome. We describe the occurrence of serotonin syndrome after fentanyl use in two patients taking multiple serotonergic agents.
Two patients who had been taking multiple serotonergic medications or herbal supplements (one patient taking fluoxetine, turmeric supplement, and acyclovir; the other taking fluoxetine and trazodone) developed serotonin syndrome perioperatively when undergoing outpatient procedures. Both experienced acute loss of consciousness and generalized myoclonus after receiving fentanyl. In one patient, the serotonin syndrome promptly resolved after naloxone administration. In the other patient, the onset of serotonin syndrome was delayed and manifested after discharge, most likely attributed to the intraoperative use of midazolam for sedation.
Even small doses of fentanyl administered to patients taking multiple serotonergic medications and herbal supplements may trigger serotonin syndrome. Prompt reversal of serotonin toxicity in one patient by naloxone illustrates the likely opioid-mediated pathogenesis of serotonin syndrome in this case. It also highlights that taking serotonergic agents concomitantly can produce the compounding effect that causes serotonin syndrome. The delayed presentation of serotonin syndrome in the patient who received a large dose of midazolam suggests that outpatients taking multiple serotonergic drugs who receive benzodiazepines may require longer postprocedural monitoring.

Abstract: Drug rash, eosinophilia, and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome is a severe systemic hypersensitivity reaction that usually occurs within 6 weeks of exposure to the offending drug. Diagnosis is usually straightforward in patients with pyrexia, skin rash, hepatitis, and eosinophilia with a preceding history of exposure to agents often associated with DRESS syndrome, such as aromatic anticonvulsants and sulfa drugs, but diagnosis of DRESS may still be a challenge. We report a 4-year-old child with probable DRESS syndrome complicated by multiple hematologic complications that developed 1 month after exposure to fluoxetine, a drug not known to be associated with such severe reactions.

Abstract: We report the case of a child prospectively followed in our institution for a severe, neonatal onset epilepsy presenting with severe attacks of apnea that were not initially recognized as seizure since they were not associated with any abnormal movement and since interictal EEG was normal. Recording of attacks using prolonged video-EEG recording allowed to confirm the diagnosis of epileptic seizures.
Using whole exome sequencing we found a de novo heterozygous, missense mutation of FHF1 (p.Arg52His, NM_004113), a mutation that has been very recently described in 7 patients with an early onset epileptic encephalopathy. The initial workup showed a partial deficit of the complex II of the respiratory chain in muscle and liver. The prospective follow-up demonstrated that 2 drugs seemed to be more effective than the others: sodium blocker carbamazepine, and serotonin reuptake blocker fluoxetine. GABAergic drugs seemed to be ineffective. No drug aggravated the epilepsy.
This case report contributes to the description of an emerging phenotype for this condition.

Abstract: Withdrawal symptoms on selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) discontinuation have raised clinical attention increasingly. However, delirium is rarely reported in the SSRI discontinuation syndrome.
We report a case of delirium developing after fluoxetine discontinuation in a 65-year-old female patient with major depressive disorder. She experienced psychotic depression with limited response to treatment of fluoxetine 40 mg/d and quetiapine 100 mg/d for 3 months. After admission, we tapered fluoxetine gradually in 5 days because of its limited effect. However, delirious pictures developed 2 days after we stopped fluoxetine. Three days later, we added back fluoxetine 10 mg/d. Her delirious features gradually improved, and the clinical presentation turned into previous psychotic depression state. We gradually increased the medication to fluoxetine 60 mg/d and olanzapine 20 mg/d in the following 3 weeks. Her psychotic symptoms decreased, and there has been no delirious picture noted thereafter.
Delirium associated with fluoxetine discontinuation is a much rarer complication in SSRI discontinuation syndrome. The symptoms of SSRI discontinuation syndrome may be attributable to a rapid decrease in serotonin availability. In general, the shorter the half-life of any medication, the greater the likelihood patients will experience discontinuation symptoms. Genetic vulnerability might be a potential factor to explain that SSRI discontinuation syndrome also occurred rapidly in people taking long-half-life fluoxetine. The genetic polymorphisms of both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic pathways might be potentially associated with SSRI discontinuation syndrome.

Abstract: Trichotillomania is a psychodermatologic disorder characterized by uncontrollable urge to pull one's own hair. Differential diagnoses include the most common forms of alopecia such as alopecia areata. It is usually associated with depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Trichotillomania treatment standardization is a gap in the medical literature. Recent studies demonstrated the efficacy of N-acetylcysteine (a glutamate modulator) for the treatment of the disease. We report the clinical case of a 12-year-old female patient who received the initial diagnosis of alopecia areata, but presented with clinical and dermoscopic features of trichotillomania. She was treated with the combination of psychotropic drugs and N-acetylcysteine with good clinical response. Due to the chronic and recurring nature of trichotillomania, more studies need to be conducted for the establishment of a formal treatment algorithm.

Abstract: We report on a patient who developed massive gastrointestinal hemorrhage related to the use of fluoxetine in combination with aspirin and clopidogrel. A 58-year-old man was admitted with a posterior circulation infarct with significant weakness in all four limbs and dysarthria. Aspirin and clopidogrel were started. Fluoxetine was started for pharmacological neurostimulation to promote motor recovery and for low mood. He developed gastrointestinal hemorrhage a week after fluoxetine was started. Fluoxetine was suspended and investigations failed to reveal the source of the bleeding. He was then restarted on fluoxetine along with dual antiplatelets, and gastrointestinal hemorrhage recurred after 1 week. He was extensively investigated for a source of gastrointestinal hemorrhage, and again no source could be identified. Eventually, fluoxetine was switched to mirtazapine with no further gastrointestinal hemorrhage. He remained on dual antiplatelets. A number of case-control and cohort studies had identified the association of gastrointestinal hemorrhage with the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). We hope to raise awareness of this association in physical medicine and rehabilitation physicians as the use of SSRI is expected to rise.

Abstract: Trichotillomania (TTM) is a mental disorder characterized by uncontrolled and impulsive hair pulling leading to hair loss, distress, and disordered functioning. Treatment choices include behavioral therapy (especially habit reversal training) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. However, randomized controlled trials conducted with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have led to controversial results of effectiveness for TTM. Here, we report a female patient whose TTM symptoms increased after fluoxetine use.

Abstract: Irreversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) antidepressants have significant efficacy in treatment-resistant unipolar depression, but in some instances patients may not achieve remission. Among the adjunctive and augmentation strategies, certain second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) have approval for inadequate responders to antidepressant therapy, including aripiprazole, brexpiprazole, and quetiapine, with lurasidone and the olanzapine/fluoxetine combination indicated for bipolar depression. Clinicians may eschew SGA options in part due to the limited literature on SGA-MAOI combinations, with only one published case involving aripiprazole, and none for olanzapine, lurasidone, or brexpiprazole. In addition to the limited publication history on SGA-MAOI treatment, clinicians may also be deterred by uncertainty regarding SGA mechanisms and the risk of serotonin syndrome or other adverse outcomes. This paper describes the case of a 54-year-old male with a history of psychotic unipolar depression treated with a combination of phenelzine, aripiprazole, and quetiapine, and reviews the 12 published cases of SGA-MAOI combination therapy with a focus on the pharmacological basis for serotonin syndrome, and the SGA mechanisms that should not be associated with a risk for this syndrome.

Abstract: Serotonin syndrome is a rare but serious complication of treatment with serotonergic agents. In its severe manifestations, death can ensue. Early recognition and aggressive management are crucial to mitigating the syndrome. Often the presentation can be subtle and easy to miss.
We present 2 cases of serotonin syndrome seen in the psychiatric consultation service of a busy academic hospital. Both patients had favorable outcomes because of early recognition and aggressive management.
Physicians should carefully consider and rule out the clinical diagnosis of serotonin syndrome when presented with an agitated or confused patient who is taking serotonergic agents.

Abstract: Previous literature has found fluoxetine to be relatively safe in overdose. This study hopes to examine this idea along with support from published pharmacokinetic information including serum fluoxetine and norfluoxetine levels based on information from a clinical case series.
Four cases are presented along with vital abnormalities, electrocardiogram abnormalities, and physical exam abnormalities along with amount of overdose and resulting serum fluoxetine and norfluoxetine levels.
In these four cases, serum fluoxetine and norfluoxetine days after overdose were found to be in a range believed to be within the treatment range. No abnormalities were found on electrocardiogram but some patients (3) were found to have slight elevations in heart rate.
Fluoxetine is relatively safe in overdose. This study supports previous literature. Future directives for research can be directed towards when serotonergic, including fluoxetine, medications can be introduced or restarted in patients who have overdosed. Research could also focus on if the introduction of another medication, such as carbamazepine, to induce metabolism of a medication, such as fluoxetine, after an overdose.

Abstract: Bupropion is an antidepressant that is effective in the treatment of major depressive disorders, smoking cessation, and sexual side effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Acute dystonia is characterized by prolonged muscle contraction often represented by spasms of the head and neck muscles as well as occasional jaw clenching and temporomandibular joint syndrome. Although it is believed that dystonia is the result of an abnormality of the basal ganglia, its pathophysiology is still unclear. A few cases of dystonia resulting from bupropion have been reported in prior research papers. This case report discusses a patient who had a neck spasm painful enough to wake him up and dystonic distortion after taking only one dose of 75 mg bupropion. The patient was a young 34-year-old man with a diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive disorder treated with 60 mg fluoxetine. Bupropion was added to his medications because of sexual side effects caused by the fluoxetine. It seems that we must be careful to watch for dystonic symptoms when bupropion is mixed with other drugs that affect serotonin reuptake. Although dystonia is a rare side effect of bupropion, physicians should be aware of it and manage it if it occurs.

Abstract: A captive hand-reared adult male snow leopard ( Uncia uncia ) was treated for anxiety associated with taunting from visitors, the presence of large crowds, and introduction to a female for breeding. Behaviors included shaking, chewing on tail, panting, panicking, and bouncing off the viewing glass, pacing, and avoidance of the female. Combination therapy of oral fluoxetine and alprazolam were administered initially to minimize anxious behaviors while the fluoxetine achieved therapeutic levels. The alprazolam was tapered completely and was only used episodically on two occasions. Although a palatability issue with alprazolam initially prevented consistent dosing, anxious behavior was eliminated and successful breeding behavior was achieved for the first time. After 44 mo of therapy, there have been no anxious behaviors requiring additional medications, two additional breeding behaviors observed, and no evidence of adverse side effects with long-term use.

Abstract: Few reports exist about the treatment of body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) in patients who are suicidal. This case report describes a 19-year-old male with BDD who had delusional-intensity beliefs about facial disfigurement that had gradually intensified over a 2-year period. However, he was initially misdiagnosed with depression partly because he was admitted immediately after a suicide attempt that was associated with depressive symptoms and social withdrawal, symptoms that subsequently proved to be secondary to his BDD. The symptoms resolved completely and his social functioning returned to normal after 8 weeks of inpatient treatment with fluoxetine and cognitive behavioral therapy. This report is a reminder that suicidal behavior and ideation can have many causes; to avoid misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment, clinicians should consider other possibilities before assuming that suicidal behavior or ideation is the direct result of depression. We discuss the many changes in the understanding and diagnostic classification of BDD since it was first reported by Enrico Morselli in 1886. 
对治疗伴自杀行为的躯体变形障碍 (bodydysmorphic disorder, BDD) 的病例报道较少。本文报道了一位患有 BDD 的19岁男性患者，两年来认为自己面部变丑，这一信念逐渐加重，几乎达妄想程度。然而，他最初被误诊为抑郁障碍，部分原因是他企图自杀，当时存在抑郁症状和社会退缩。后来经证实，这些症状是继发于 BDD 的。经过8周住院治疗，采用氟西汀和认知行为治疗相结合，患者的症状彻底改善，社会功能也恢复正常。这一病例提醒我们，自杀行为和意念有多方面原因；为了避免误诊和不恰当的治疗，临床医生只有在排除其它可能的原因后才能推断自杀行为和意念是抑郁症的直接结果。本文也讨论了自1886年 Enrico Morselli 首度报道 BDD 后，在理解 BDD 和 BDD 的诊断标准上的诸多变化。.

Abstract: The ability to adequately evaluate medications in the treatment of paraphilias has been limited by reliance upon self-report as a measure of effectiveness over periods of time that may be too short to detect reoffending. One solution to this shortcoming is the development of valid, long-term, stable assessment measures. The purpose of this case study was to analyze the effects of Prozac and Provera on an array of behaviors germane to the successful treatment of paraphilias, including: (a) sexual arousal in the laboratory and natural environment, (b) sexual thoughts (deviant and nondeviant) accompanied by arousal in the natural environment, and (c) overt actions in the community associated with increased risk of reoffending over a 31-month period for an exhibitionist with an intellectual disability. Despite the ineffectiveness of the medications, the measures demonstrated long-term, differentiated significant clinical responding; further underscored the importance of assessing deviant sexual arousal and adherence to relapse-prevention procedures in the natural environment; and provided a new methodology to assess sexual preoccupations and sexual arousal. Use of these in vivo measures raises questions regarding their potential to improve the predictability of risk assessments, and serve as an aide in the analysis of whether a treatment procedure is effective for an individual.

Abstract: Enterovirus may result in a devastating chronic encephalitis in immunocompromised patients, particularly in patients with X-linked agammaglobulinemia. Prognosis for patients with chronic enterovirus encephalitis is poor, almost invariably resulting in mortality without specific treatment. There are currently no approved antiviral agents for enterovirus, but the antidepressant drug fluoxetine has been identified through library-based compound screening as a potential anti-enteroviral agent in vitro. However, use of fluoxetine has not previously been studied in humans with enteroviral disease.
A five year old boy with X-linked agammaglobulinemia presented with progressive neurological deterioration and was found to have chronic enterovirus encephalitis by brain biopsy. He failed to respond to standard treatment with high dose intravenous immunoglobulin, but showed stabilization and improvement following treatment with fluoxetine.
This is the first report to describe the use of fluoxetine as a potential therapy for chronic enterovirus infection. Further investigation of fluoxetine as a treatment option for chronic enterovirus encephalitis is necessary.

Abstract: We describe a case study of comorbid obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in a nine-year-old boy with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Patient history included persistent deficits in social communication and restrictive and repetitive patterns of behavior: a diagnosis of autism spectrum was formalized. Due to serious disruption on social functioning and negative development of the obsessive behavior we decided to start pharmacotherapy. Fluoxetine 5 mg/day was started and gradually increased to 20 mg/day. A significant positive effect was observed by both parents and teacher in daily functioning. Although parents reported a positive change in mood, formal behavior rating by them did not reveal a significant effect, reflecting the insensitivity of general behavior rating scales. However, neuropsychological testing revealed a significant effect. This case report highlights the diagnostic and therapeutic challenges of complex neuropsychiatric comorbidities in DMD. It is the first scientific report on fluoxetine effectiveness in this patient group. Further research is needed.

Abstract: We present the case of an 11 year-old boy with a previous history of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), who experienced a dramatic and acute worsening of OCD symptoms in temporal association with obstructive hydrocephalus secondary to a tectal low-grade glioma. Management and resolution of the hydrocephalus was temporally associated with an improvement in his OCD compulsion symptoms. The present case does not establish proof of cause and effect, but highlights potential multifactorial influences on OCD onset and clinical course. Cortico-striatal-thalamic-cortical pathways, physically distorted by hydrocephalus in this case, have long been implicated in OCD etiology. Clinical implications include the importance of conducting an appropriate neurologic work-up to rule out biological causes for acute and dramatic OCD exacerbations with neurologic signs, even in the context of preexisting OCD. Given that neurologic lesions may exist in the absence of typical signs and symptoms, that they may further disrupt OCD circuitry, and that treatment may lead to resolution of associated psychiatric symptoms, it is important to remain cognizant of these differential diagnoses.

Abstract: The 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene plays a central role in folate metabolism. Many studies have demonstrated an association between MTHFR C677 T variant with depression, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder as one of them being comorbid to other. This has justified the use of folate supplement in psychiatric disorders mainly depression but still not in various other comorbid complex psychiatric disorders. Here we have tried to show how the l-methylfolate in conjunction with the conventional psychotropic drugs can be useful in a state of such complex psychiatric phenomenon and comorbid diagnosis with genetic polymorphism of MTHFR C677 T mutation.

Abstract: Synthetic Cannabinoid Receptor Agonists (SCRAs) are the largest group of new psychoactive substances reported to the European Warning System and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime to date. The heterogeneous nature and speed of diversification of these compounds make it challenging to accurately characterise and predict harms of these compounds in pre-clinical studies, ahead of their appearance.
We report the case of a 19-year-old female who purchased three products from a headshop: two new psychoactive substances (sachets of "cannabis tea" and "mushroom tea") as well as two LSD blotters. After the "cannabis tea" was smoked and the two LSD blotters and "mushroom tea" were ingested, the patient became tachycardic (HR 128), developed seizures, agitation, visual hallucinations as well as suspected serotonergic toxicity (sustained ankle clonus 20-30 beats) 1-2 hours after use. She was treated with 1 mg of intravenous midazolam. Symptoms/signs resolved within 13 hours. No further supportive care was required. Plasma, blood, and urine samples confirmed the presence of two SCRAs: 5FAKB-48 and 5F-PB-22. The patient also reported therapeutic use of both fluoxetine and citalopram for depression.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report of non-fatal intoxication with 5F-AKB-48 with analytical confirmation and exposure times. It also highlights the difficulties in understanding the pattern of toxicity of certain SCRAs in the context of psychotropic medications/co-morbid mental illness.

Abstract: Obsessive compulsive symptoms have been reported in frontal lobe tumours and basal ganglia lesions. We report herewith a case of an adolescent who had a vermian cystic mass for which he underwent excision surgery. Three months postsurgery family members noticed that he started with repeated hand washing and abnormal walking pattern. Also, he developed bedwetting in sleep at night. He was given clinical diagnosis of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) and Nocturnal enuresis following a cerebellar mass removal which improved with fluoxetine and impiramine respectively.

Abstract: Fluoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor and long-lived open channel blocker of the acetylcholine receptor, often used in the treatment of slow-channel congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS).
We report a 42-year-old woman who had a history of episodic limb weakness that worsened after initiation of fluoxetine for treatment of depression. Genetic testing for CMS revealed a homozygous pathogenic mutation in the rapsyn (RAPSN) gene (p.Asn88Lys). Electrodiagnostic testing was performed before and 1 month after discontinuation of fluoxetine.
The 2 Hz repetitive nerve stimulation of the fibular and spinal accessory nerves showed a baseline decrement of 36% and 14%, respectively. One month after discontinuing fluoxetine, the spinal accessory nerve decrement was no longer present, and the decrement in the fibular nerve was improved at 17%.
This case demonstrates worsening of both clinical and electrophysiologic findings in a patient with CMS secondary to a RAPSN mutation treated with fluoxetine. Muscle Nerve 55: 131-135, 2017.

Abstract: Hyponatremia is one of the most common electrolyte abnormalities and can be life threatening. Fluoxetine is a serotonin reuptake inhibitor and may rarely cause hyponatremia. Furthermore, fluoxetine may rarely increase the risk of bleeding events. We report a 66-year old woman who presented with severe hyponatremia and epistaxis associated with the use of fluoxetine.

Abstract: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is an acute coronary syndrome that is believed to be brought on by stress. Symptoms, which are similar to an acute myocardial infarction, include chest pain, shortness of breath, arrhythmias, and cardiogenic shock, and the electrocardiogram often shows ST and T wave changes. Left ventricular wall hypokinesis along with a significantly reduced ejection fraction are seen on echocardiogram. The great majority of these symptoms all occur in the absence of occlusive disease. Many cases have been reported in which the development of takotsubo cardiomyopathy was associated with serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants. However, no cases of takotsubo cardiomyopathy have been reported involving selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. This article presents the case of a 51-year-old woman receiving stable therapy with fluoxetine who developed takotsubo cardiomyopathy after an acute stress. We also discuss the clinical presentation of takotsubo cardiomyopathy, review possible causes, and discuss the treatment of depressive symptoms in patients who are at increased risk of developing this illness.

Abstract: Many psychotropic medications target norepinephrine receptors, which can have serious cardiovascular implications, especially in the context of overdoses, polypharmacy, and high-risk populations. This article presents the case of a patient with adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder who developed takotsubo cardiomyopathy subsequent to pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between atomoxetine, a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, and fluoxetine. Clinicians should be mindful of the potential for cardiovascular adverse effects when prescribing agents that target noradrenergic receptors.

Abstract: Our case involves persistent hiccup arising in an adolescent with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) who was using aripiprazole as an augmentation to fluoxetine and whose hiccups remitted with dose reduction and rechallenge. Treatment suggested that aripiprazole might lead to hiccups. Antipsychotics are also used for the treatment of hiccups, but recent case reports suggest that they cause hiccups as well. Within 12 h of taking 5 mg aripiprazole, the 13-year-old girl began having continuous hiccups, which lasted for 3-4 h. The hiccups resolved when the dose of aripiprazole was reduced to 2.5 mg. To achieve augmentation, aripiprazole was replaced with risperidone 0.5 mg/day for 1 month, but excess sedation was observed. As a result, aripiprazole was restarted at a dose of 2.5 mg/day, and 1 week later, it was increased to 5 mg/every other day. No hiccups were observed.

Abstract: Antidepressant drugs are reported to cause alterations in blood glucose homeostasis in adults with diabetes mellitus. We report a patient with persistent congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI) who developed recurrent hypoglycaemia following fluoxetine therapy. This 15-year-old girl was initially managed with diazoxide therapy. She developed troublesome hypertrichosis, which affected her quality of life adversely. Diazoxide was then slowly weaned and stopped with the introduction of octreotide, to which she responded well. Subcutaneous lanreotide (long-acting somatostatin analogue) was subsequently commenced (30 mg, once monthly) as injecting octreotide multiple times a day was proving to be difficult for the patient. The continuous blood glucose monitoring on monthly lanreotide injections revealed good glycaemic control. Six months later, she developed depression due to psychosocial problems at school. She was started on fluoxetine by the psychiatry team. She subsequently developed recurrent symptomatic hypoglycaemic episodes (blood glucose <3.5 mmol/L) and fluoxetine was discontinued, following which the hypoglycaemic episodes resolved within a week. Fluoxetine has been associated with hypoglycaemia in patients with diabetes mellitus. We report, for the first time, hypoglycaemia secondary to fluoxetine in a patient with CHI.

Abstract: Serotonin syndrome (SS) is a potentially life-threatening condition resulting from excessive central and peripheral serotonergic activity. Clinically, it is a triad of mental-status changes, neuromuscular abnormalities, and autonomic disturbances. It can be caused by intentional self-poisoning, overdose, or inadvertent drug interactions. We report the case of a 58-year-old male with type 2 diabetes mellitus and obsessive compulsive disorder who developed pulmonary edema as a possible complication of SS. SS was caused by a combination of three specific serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and sertraline), linezolid, and fentanyl. The hospital course was further complicated by difficult weaning from the ventilator. SS was identified and successfully treated with cyproheptadine and lorazepam. The case highlights the importance of effective consultation-liaison and prompt recognition of SS as the presentation may be complex in the presence of co-morbid medical illness.

Abstract: Priapism is defined by persistent, painful penile erection which occurs without sexual stimulation. Methadone is used as an analgesic and is also used in detoxification and maintenance protocol for opioid dependence treatment. Here we will report a case of a male with priapism after rapid discontinuation doses of methadone.
The case was a young married male who referred to a psychiatry clinic due to long-time spontaneous erections. The patient had no history of mental disorders, trauma or sickle cell anemia. He used to smoke opium for five years and used methadone for four years at a dose of 17 cc daily, which he abruptly discontinued. Then he often experienced spontaneous and painful erections without physical or mental stimulation that caused him shame and embarrassment.
In this case, chronology indicates that rapid discontinuation of methadone was possibly responsible for the occurrence of priapism. This may have happened due to a compensatory reaction to methadone side effect of erectile dysfunction, followed by its rapid withdrawal.

Abstract: Human ejaculation happens in the orgasmic phase of the human sexual response cycle. Among psychosomatic ejaculatory disorders that may happen before ejaculation, we present two cases of preejaculatory illness syndrome. The two cases shared common symptoms of sympathetic over activity, the sensation of impending death, and muscle atonia with subsequent failure to ejaculate. Depression, anxiety disorders, and family histories of psychiatric problems were noticed as risk factors. Medical conditions that may lead to panic attack type symptoms were eliminated before the final diagnosis. After the failure of empirical medications, symptoms became controlled with fluoxetine. Patients reported a recurrence of the symptoms on trying to stop the prescribed medication. On the last follow-up, they still take fluoxetine on a regular base with satisfactory sexual life.

Abstract: We present a case of a young adult with both Cornelia de Lange syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. The patient showed non-verbal autism, intellectual disability and severe/intractable self-harming behaviours that led to a life-threatening complication (ie, septicaemia). A significant reduction in the self-harming behaviours was attained in a multidisciplinary neurobehavioural inpatient unit after addressing all causes of somatic pains, managing pain using level II and III analgesics, stabilising the patient's mood, limiting the iatrogenic effects of multiple prescriptions and offering a specific psychoeducational approach.

Abstract: Beth, whom you have cared for in your primary care practice since she was born, is a 15-year-old adolescent girl with no prior psychiatric history who developed significant symptoms of clinical depression, associated with self-injurious behavior (cutting on wrists, arms, and thighs). She denied any known precipitant for her depression.She is a ninth grade honors student in the gifted program at a local high school and is described as a talented musician, playing multiple musical instruments as well as soccer and basketball. She has good family support, was sociable, and had several close friends. She denied any history of trauma and denied ever using recreational drugs or other mood-altering substances.At this visit, she reported feeling "sad and anxious." Family history was significant for maternal depression, which persisted through her teens and twenties. Her older sister had been diagnosed with Social Anxiety Disorder. Beth reported anhedonia, fatigue and irritable mood, lack of motivation, impaired concentration, and anxiety related to failing grades.You decide to begin medication because of the severity of her symptoms, and 1 week after starting fluoxetine 10 mg, she reportedly overdosed on an unknown quantity of acetaminophen. Within a few days of switching to escitalopram (due to persistent gastrointestinal complaints while taking fluoxetine), she developed homicidal ideation. She reported feeling grandiose, empowered, invincible, elated, and "crazy," although she never demonstrated or endorsed psychotic symptoms. She became fixated upon the idea that she could kill someone and "get away with it." At the time she tried to suffocate a peer with her hands, she was described as having "a glazed over look in her eyes." Moods were now described as alternating between depressed and elated, with mood shifts occurring every few days. These symptoms did not improve after the antidepressant medication was discontinued.Subsequently, patient was admitted for acute psychiatric care, at which time she was described as depressed, but with an "expansive and irritable" mood, and with obsessive suicidal ideation. She had developed a plan to hang herself in the home. She started to believe that her mother was trying to give her "poison." She reported panic attacks and said that she wanted to be in the hospital where she could feel "safe." She claimed to have an "entity inside of her body who was a bully" and who was "taking over her body" and stated that he put her hand over her peer's mouth, as she watched.Psychological testing included the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-Adolescent, showed significant paranoia, bizarre mentation, and poor reality testing. Along with interview and observation, it was determined that patient met criteria for the DSM-IV-TR clinical diagnosis of Other Specified Bipolar Disorder, with psychotic features.Aripiprazole was initiated at a dosage of 2 mg; however, moods were still described as fluctuating between extremes every few hours. It was discontinued after reaching 5 mg due to affective blunting. Risperidone 0.5 mg twice daily helped patient to feel and act "more like herself"; however, she continued to report significant depression. The addition of lamotrigine 25 mg daily, in addition to individual Dialectical Behavior Therapy, finally led to improvement of mood and a gradual return of her normal baseline, with reportedly stable emotional, social, and academic functioning.The patient's mother remained convinced that this adolescent's mood instability was caused by underlying hormonal problems so you refer her to endocrinology. Beth developed puberty at age 8, with menses occurring on average of twice yearly. She was found to have elevated free testosterone level of 8.6 (reference range, 1.2-7.5). She was of normal weight (body mass index = 21.85 kg/m) and did not manifest acne, male pattern hair thinning, or hirsutism. Thyroid functions, 17-OH progesterone, follicle-stimulating hormone/luteinizing hormone, and estradiol were within normal limits. Prolactin elevation (46.3) was assumed to be due to Risperidone. Patient refused ovarian ultrasound.After starting oral contraceptives to establish monthly menses, patient's emotional and behavioral symptoms continue to remain stable. After Beth decided on her own to discontinue psychotropic medications, she continued for 17 months following her initial visit to remain free of neuropsychiatric symptoms.Now that her symptoms seem resolved; you wonder what the medical diagnosis for Beth was? You wonder if "hormones" may have caused or contributed to her psychiatric presentation.

Abstract: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are typically used as antidepressants. Clinically significant SSRI-induced thyroid dysfunction is rare.
We report a case of hyperthyroidism induced by fluoxetine in a female patient with major depressive disorder. Her thyroid profiles indicated hyperthyroidism after a 10-week treatment with fluoxetine and were restored after discontinuation of fluoxetine and administration with venlafaxine. In the first year of follow-up, her thyroid functions as well as her depressive symptoms remained perfectly normal.
This case highlights the necessity of monitoring thyroid profiles during SSRI treatment.

Abstract: Movement disorders or extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) associated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have been reported. Although akathisia was found to be the most common EPS, and fluoxetine was implicated in the majority of the adverse reactions, there were also cases with EPS due to sertraline treatment. We present a child and an adolescent who developed torticollis (cervical dystonia) after using sertraline. To our knowledge, the child case is the first such report of sertraline-induced torticollis, and the adolescent case is the third in the literature.

Abstract: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are widely prescribed to patients of all ages. Although generally considered safe, therapy with SSRIs can be complicated by serotonin syndrome (SS), a life-threatening condition. We present a case of SS that developed in a young man who was receiving a stable dose of fluoxetine and then received several commonly used medications during an emergent appendectomy. Because polypharmacy in the perioperative setting may trigger SS, it is important for anesthesiologists to be cognizant of the interactions between SSRIs and common perioperative medications to formulate anesthetic plans that optimize patient safety.

Abstract: Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) are known to occur in patients with intellectual disability and at rates least proportional to the general population but often the developmental disabilities and lack of communication in these patients make it difficult to diagnose and assess the disorder and hence go undetected and untreated. Once diagnosed, treating OCD is another challenge faced by therapist in patients with intellectual disabilities. We report a case of intellectual disability with OCD highlighting the diagnostic and therapeutic challenges.

Abstract: Obsessive slowness is described to be a syndrome of extreme slowness in ways various tasks are performed. Its existence as an independent syndrome is challenged by authors, who regard it to be a part of obsessive compulsive disorder. We describe here a case of a 24-year-old male patient who presented with catatonic symptoms. Diagnostic difficulties and management issues are highlighted.

Abstract: Aripiprazole, a dopamine stabilizing atypical antipsychotic is used in treatment of tardive dyskinesia caused by other neuroleptics. Tardive dyskinesia is rarely caused by Aripiprazole and has only been documented in high risk patients i.e., female gender, advanced age, affective illness, coexisting neurological disorders. Here the author describes two atypical cases of tardive dyskinesia associated with Aripiprazole. First case of tardive dyskinesia was observed in a neuroleptic naïve young adult male with paranoid illness after six months of treatment with Aripiprazole upon addition of Fluoxetine and the second case was a middle aged female with affective illness where dyskinetic movements appeared after stopping Aripiprazole. The role of Fluoxetine in causing tardive dyskinesia with Aripiprazole and covert dyskinesia due to Aripiprazole with appropriate management is discussed.

Abstract: Loperamide, a common over-the-counter antidiarrheal drug and opioid derivative, is formulated to act upon intestinal opioid receptors. However, at high doses, loperamide crosses the blood-brain barrier and reaches central opioid receptors in the brain, leading to central opiate effects including euphoria and respiratory depression. We report the case of a young man found dead in his residence with a known history of drug abuse. At autopsy, the only significant findings were a distended bladder and bloody oral purge. Drug screening found nontoxic levels of alprazolam, fluoxetine, and marijuana metabolites. Liquid chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry found an unusual set of split isotope peaks consistent with chlorine. On the basis of autopsy and toxicological findings, loperamide toxicity was suspected because of its opioid properties and molecular formula containing chlorine. A sample of loperamide was analyzed by liquid chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry, resulting in a matching mass and retention time to the decedent's sample. Subsequently, quantitative testing detected 63 ng/mL of loperamide or more than 6 times of therapeutic peak concentration. Cause of death was determined as "toxic effects of loperamide with fluoxetine and alprazolam." Because of its opioid effects and easy accessibility, loperamide is known as "poor man's methadone" and may go undetected at medical and forensic drug screening.

Abstract: Oral paresthesias are common in clinical practice but they often go unnoticed and untreated. Psychogenic oral paresthesia is an unpleasant sensation of tingling or pricking or a feeling of swelling or burning, with spontaneous onset.It can result due to local, systemic, psychogenic or idiopathic causes. Among psychogenic causes; anxiety disorder and depression are common. We describe a 32-year-old patient presented with lingual paresthesia and features suggestive of depression. He responded to an antidepressant, fluoxetine 40 mg /day.

Abstract: To describe a case of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) comorbid with Melkersson-Rosenthal Syndrome (MRS).
We present a case study of comorbid OCD and MRS in a 13-year-old girl.
She admitted to doubt obsessions and a control compulsion. The patient history included frequent facial palsy attacks, and she took prednisolone during each attack. She had her first such attack at 5 years of age, and she had suffered five attacks since then, the last one occurring 2 months before her presentation. Her obsessions began 1 week after the last attack. She was diagnosed MRS and concurrent OCD based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, diagnostic criteria. She was started on 20 mg/day fluoxetine. The control compulsion subsided during the second month of therapy, and the doubt obsessions improved significantly.
Considering that the etiologies of MRS and childhood-onset OCD have been attributed to infectious agents and autoimmune events, we conclude that both causes may play an important role in the etiology of these conditions.

Abstract: Despite widespread awareness of their frequent co-occurrence, little is known about treatment of individuals with comorbid posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and dissociative disorders. Patients with dissociative disorders do not respond well to standard exposure therapy, and few psychopharmacologic trials exist. Fluoxetine proved ineffective for depersonalization disorder, but paroxetine showed efficacy in decreasing dissociative symptoms in PTSD patients.

Abstract: Hypothyroidism is easily treated by levothyroxine therapy which has an 80 percent absorption rate, mostly in the jejunum. The replacement dose of daily levothyroxine is usually calculated at 1.6 mcg/kg body weight per day. We report a 77-year-old man who required supraphysiologic thyroxine replacement (>2.7 mcg/ kg/day) to treat his hypothyroidism. The patient was referred for persistent thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) elevation (40 mcIU/ml) while on 175 mcg of levothyroxine. Patient was compliant with medication. Medical history included diabetes mellitus type 2, cerebrovascular accident, depression, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, vitamin B12 deficiency, Addison’s disease, as well as a colostomy secondary to diverticulitis. He was taking aspirin, carvedilol, cholecalciferol, finasteride, fluoxetine, furosemide, ketoconazole, levothyroxine, prednisone, and albuterol/ipratropium inhaler. His height was 180.3 cm; weight, 107 kg. Thyroid was impalpable, and he was clinically euthyroid. Despite discontinuation of iron and statin which are known to interfere with thyroxine absorption and crushing of thyroxine tablets to enhance absorption, his TSH remained elevated. Celiac disease and Helicobacter pylori infection were ruled out with serological testing. There was no proteinuria and anti-parietal cell antibody was positive. Gastroparesis was confirmed by gastric emptying study. He continued to require increasing doses of thyroxine with increment to 300 mcg daily. To our knowledge, this is the first documented association between gastroparesis and thyroxine malabsorption. We recommend that gastroparesis be considered in any patient with persistent TSH elevation despite usual thyroxine doses.

Abstract: A late preterm presented with tachypnoea, jitteriness, irritability and low grade fever. Blood gas showed a compensated metabolic acidosis. His mother was taking the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) fluoxetine, 60 mg/day, and he was exclusively breast-fed. The baby's serum level of fluoxetine on day 8 was within the adult therapeutic range and his symptoms were ascribed to fluoxetine toxicity. On changing to formula feeds, his symptoms resolved. SSRIs are commonly administered during pregnancy, but SSRI toxicity in infants is rarely reported. It is possible that this condition is under diagnosed or, alternatively, misdiagnosed as SSRI withdrawal in breast fed infants whose mothers are on SSRIs. There is limited research looking at serotonin excess in neonates, making case reports such as this important in our learning. Increased awareness may prompt more frequent measurements of blood levels in breast-fed infants whose mothers are on SSRIs.

Abstract: We present the case of a 40-year-old man consulting for uncontrollable episodes of laughing related to emotional lability and not systematically linked to feelings of happiness. Seven months earlier he had presented a pontine ischemic stroke related to an occlusion of the basilar and left vertebral arteries. No epileptic activity or new MRI brain lesions were found. Brain perfusion SPECT performed showed marked hypoperfusion in the right frontal inferior and temporoinsular regions, suggesting a diaschisis phenomenon caused by pontine lesions and highlighted laughing regulation pathways. The patient was successfully treated with a serotonergic reuptake inhibitor, fluoxetine.

Abstract: Breath-holding spells are a common childhood disorder that typically present before 12 months of age. Whereas most cases are benign, some patients have very severe cases associated with bradycardia that can progress from asystole to syncope and seizures. Treatment studies have implicated the use of several therapies, such as oral iron, fluoxetine, and pacemaker implantation. This is a retrospective study of patients treated with glycopyrrolate for pallid breath-holding spells. Clinical data from 4 patients referred to pediatric cardiology who saw therapeutic benefit from treatment using glycopyrrolate were reviewed to evaluate for clinical response to the drug. Two twin patients, whose symptoms began at 5 months of age, experienced a decrease in breath-holding frequency after 1 month. A patient diagnosed at 7 months of age experienced a decrease in frequency of spells. A patient diagnosed at 10 months of age reported cessation of syncope shortly after initiation of glycopyrrolate and complete resolution of breath-holding spells during prolonged treatment. This case study of 4 patients with pallid breath-holding offers evidence that glycopyrrolate may be beneficial in treating breath-holding spells and has a safer side-effect profile than pacemaker implantation.

Abstract: Serotonin specific reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) are widely used antidepressants for variety of clinical conditions and have found popularity. They are sometimes associated with extrapyramidal side effects including Parkinsonism. We report a case of generalized anxiety disorder on treatment with SSRI (fluoxetine / sertraline) who developed irreversible Parkinsonism. SSRI are known to cause reversible or irreversible motor disturbances through pathophysiological changes in basal ganglion motor system by altering the dopamine receptors postsynaptically. Clinician should keep risk benefit ratio in mind and change of antidepressant of different class may be considered. Case is reported to alert physicians to possibility of motor system damage while treating with SSRI.

Abstract: Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) requires emergency treatment and can be fatal. Combined aripiprazole and clozapine therapy is rarely used in clinical settings, and NMS related this combination still lacks evaluation. Herein, we present two cases of atypical NMS treated with aripiprazole and clozapine.
Case 1 was a schizophrenic male with a history of NMS under treatment with aripiprazole 20 mg. He was hospitalized and maintained with aripiprazole 5 mg and clozapine 225 mg. On the 25th day, atypical NMS occurred with rigidity, elevated creatine kinase, and stupor, which subsided with supportive therapy. He was discharged under treatment with aripiprazole 15 mg and fluoxetine 60 mg. Case 2 was a female with schizoaffective disorder without a history of NMS. She was hospitalized and maintained with clozapine 50 mg and aripirazole 30 mg. On the 11th day, atypical NMS occurred with mild fever, delirium, and rigidity, which subsided under supportive therapy.
Our cases highlight the atypical features of NMS in patients being treated with combined ari-piprazole and clozapine. Consciousness change, modest elevation of creatine kinase, and leukocytosis were the most consistent findings; hyperthermia accounts for only some of the cases. This is a reminder of the importance of earlier detection of the soft signs and atypical features of NMS under this combined treatment.

Abstract: Obsessive-compulsive-related cutaneous disease most often includes trichotillomania, neurotic excoriations and nail biting. In this report, we present two cases of self-inflicted severe wounds that were diagnosed as secondary to obsessive-compulsive behaviour. Patients were middle-aged females who presented with deep cutaneous ulcers that were acknowledgedly maintained through repetitive manipulation. Obsessive-compulsive-related cutaneous disease is better treated with serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants in higher dosages than those used to treat depression. Both patients were treated with fluoxetine 60-80 mg that resulted in adequate healing of the ulcers; relapses were observed during attempts to taper fluoxetine dosage. An adequate psychic diagnosis is required if an effective therapeutic response to self-inflicted cutaneous lesions is desired, because clinically identical lesions can also be caused as a result of distinct mental mechanisms: anxiety, depression, psychosis, obsessive-compulsive disorder and classic dermatitis artefacta.

Abstract: Vasectomy is a commonly performed and relatively safe procedure, with low reported rates of psychological morbidity, though there is some variability across studies. Depression following a vasectomy is relatively infrequent. A married man aged 30 developed a chronic depressive episode, lasting four years and resistant to an adequate trial of fluoxetine, following a vasectomy. His depression was heralded by a post-operative panic attack, and was accompanied by medically unexplained symptoms and the attribution of all his symptoms to the procedure - a belief that was shared by his family. Psychological complications of vasectomy have generally been studied under four heads: sexual dysfunction, effects on marital relationships, chronic post-operative pain, and other complications including anxiety and depression. These complications have generally been reported at higher rates in developing countries, and are linked to poor knowledge about the procedure and inadequate pre-operative counseling. The implications of the existing literature for the patient's current complaints, and the mechanisms and risk factors involved, are discussed in the light of existing research. Suggestions for the prevention and treatment of post-vasectomy depression are also outlined.

Abstract: Serotonin released in the nerve synapses is cleared through reuptake into presynaptic neurons and metabolism with monoamine oxidase (MAO). Therapy with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or MAO inhibitors increases serotonin concentration in the synaptic cleft and may result in serotonin syndrome (SS). Our patient undergoing sentinel lymph node biopsy was on fluoxetine (SSRI) and intraoperatively developed SS after receiving fentanyl (200 μg) and methylene blue (MAO inhibitor), 7 mg subcutaneously into the scalp. Initial presentation was several episodes of generalized muscle activity, which was later diagnosed as lower extremity myoclonus consistent with SS. Upon awakening, the patient showed no evidence of encephalopathy, and the clonus was less intense. The patient was discharge home the next day. Our case suggests the possibility that even a small dose of methylene blue, when administered simultaneously with other serotoninergic medications, may be associated with serotonin toxicity.

Abstract: 4-Fluoroamphetamine (4-FA) is a para-substituted phenethylamine-type synthetic stimulant that has in recent years gained popularity through internet blogs and market share according to confiscated drug data. No serious toxicity has previously been reported. We report a case of a young man who developed severe toxicity and cardiogenic shock after using 4-FA, with laboratory confirmation.
An 18-year-old man presented to the emergency department with vomiting, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and altered mental status about 5 h after using a new and unfamiliar street drug. Two days prior, he had received naltrexone intramuscular injection as part of an opioid addiction treatment program and was taking fluoxetine and trazodone. Five hours after presentation, he developed cardiogenic shock requiring intraaortic balloon pump, inotropic and ventilatory support. An echocardiogram showed left ventricular (LV) hypokinesia, sparing the apex and ejection fraction (EF) = 10%. Comprehensive toxicology serum testing revealed FA, naproxen, trazodone, and cotinine. The 4-FA urine level was 64,000 ng/ml and serum level was 118 ng/ml. With slow recovery, the patient was discharged after 2 weeks of hospitalization.
Although no previously reported 4-FA clinical poisoning cases have been published for comparison, by examining 4-FA pharmacology compared with other stimulant drugs, and given this patient's presentation and echocardiogram suggestive of reverse takotsubo cardiomyopathy we suspect the toxic mechanism was an acute cardiomyopathy caused by 4-FA catecholamine-induced myocarditis and/or small vessel myocardial ischemia.
Recreational use of 4-FA may present with life threatening toxicity including cardiomyopathy, cardiogenic shock, and pulmonary edema.

Abstract: A multidrug fatality involving sumatriptan is reported. Sumatriptan is a tryptamine derivative that acts at 5-HT(1B/1D) receptors and is used for the treatment of migraines. The decedent was a 21-year-old white female found dead in bed by her spouse. No signs of physical trauma were observed and a large number of prescription medications were discovered at the scene. Toxicological analysis of the central blood revealed sumatriptan at a concentration of 1.03 mg/L. Following therapeutic dosing guidelines, sumatriptan concentrations do not exceed 0.095 mg/L. Sumatriptan was isolated by solid-phase extraction and analyzed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in multiple reaction monitoring mode. A tissue distribution study was completed with the following concentrations measured: 0.61 mg/L in femoral blood, 0.56 mg/L in iliac blood, 5.01 mg/L in urine, 0.51 mg/kg in liver, 3.66 mg/kg in kidney, 0.09 mg/kg in heart, 0.32 mg/kg in spleen, 0.01 mg/kg in brain, 15.99 mg/kg in lung and 78.54 mg/45 mL in the stomach contents. Carisoprodol, meprobamate, fluoxetine, doxylamine, orphenadrine, dextromethorphan and hydroxyzine were also present in the blood at the following concentrations: 3.35, 2.36, 0.63, 0.19, 0.06, 0.55 and 0.16 mg/L. The medical examiner ruled the cause of death as acute mixed drug toxicity and the manner of death as accident.

Abstract: Intravenous lipid emulsion (ILE) is a lifesaving treatment of lipophilic drug intoxications. Not only does ILE have demonstrable efficacy as an antidote to local anesthetic toxicity, it is also effective in lipophilic drug intoxications. Our case series involved 10 patients with ingestion of different types of lipophilic drugs. Intravenous lipid emulsion treatment improved Glasgow Coma Scale or blood pressure and pulse rate or both according to the drug type. Complications were observed in 2 patients (minimal change pancreatitis and probable ILE treatment-related fat infiltration in lungs). In our case series, ILE was used for different lipophilic drug intoxications to improve cardiovascular and neurologic symptoms. According to the results, it was found that ILE treatment is a lifesaving agent in lipophilic drug intoxications and it can be used in unconscious patients who have cardiac and/or neurologic symptoms but no history of a specific drug ingestion.

Abstract: An adult woman with Dravet syndrome (documented SCN1A mutation) experienced a marked reduction in seizures when treated with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) fluoxetine. The seizure reduction may be partly to reductions associated with aging in Dravet patients, but it appears to be due at least in part to the fluoxetine. A prior preliminary study reported that fenfluramine reduces seizures in patients with Dravet syndrome. Fenfluramine may produce this effect by increasing serotonin brain levels, and SSRIs have been found to possess antiepileptic properties in animal models of epilepsy. Given the known cardiac risks of fenfluramine, consideration of randomized clinical trials with SSRIs should be considered in Dravet syndrome and other epilepsies.

Abstract: Cervical interlaminar epidural steroid injections (ESIs) are commonly performed as one part of a multi-modal analgesic regimen in the management of upper extremity radicular pain. Spinal epidural hematoma (SEH) is a rare complication with a reported incidence ranging from 1.38 in 10,000 to 1 in 190,000 epidurals. Current American Society of Regional Anesthesia (ASRA), American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP), and the International Spine Intervention Society (ISIS) recommendations are that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) do not need to be withheld prior to epidural anesthesia. We report a case wherein intramuscular ketorolac and oral fluoxetine contributed to a SEH and tetraplegia following a cervical interlaminar (ESI). A 66 year-old woman with chronic renal insufficiency and neck pain radiating into her right upper extremity presented for evaluation and was deemed an appropriate CESI candidate. Cervical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed multi-level neuroforaminal stenosis and degenerative intervertebral discs. Utilizing a loss of resistance to saline technique, an 18-gauge Tuohy-type needle entered the epidural space at C6-7. After negative aspiration, 4 mL of saline with 80 mg of methyl-prednisolone was injected. Immediately thereafter, the patient reported significant spasmodic-type localized neck pain with no neurologic status changes. A decision was made to administer 30 mg intramuscular ketorolac as treatment for the spasmodic-type pain. En route home, she developed a sudden onset of acute tetraplegia. She was brought to the emergency department for evaluation including platelet and coagulation studies which were normal. MRI demonstrated an epidural hematoma extending from C5 to T7. She underwent a bilateral C5-T6 laminectomy with epidural hematoma evacuation and was discharged to an acute inpatient rehabilitation hospital. Chronic renal insufficiency, spinal stenosis, female gender, and increasing age have been identified as risk factors for SEH following epidural anesthesia. In the present case, it is postulated that after the spinal vascular system was penetrated, hemostasis was compromised by the combined antiplatelet effects of ketorolac, fluoxetine, fish oil, and vitamin E. Although generally well tolerated, the role of ketorolac, a potent anti-platelet medication used for pain relief in the peri-neuraxial intervention period, should be seriously scrutinized when other analgesic options are readily available. Although the increased risk of bleeding for the alternative medications are minimal, they are nevertheless well documented. Additionally, their additive impairment on hemostasis has not been well characterized. Withholding NSAIDs, fluoxetine, fish oil, and vitamin E in the peri-procedural period is relatively low risk and should be considered for all patients with multiple risk factors for SEH.

Abstract: We report a case of 20 Years old girl who presented with catatonia resulting from cerebral lupus. There are few cases of catatonia being described in Systemic Lupus Erythmatoses (SLE). The patient presented to us with fever and altered sensorium. She was initially treated on lines of Acute Bacterial Meningitis/encephalitis but lumbar puncture examination and CT scan showed no evidence of these conditions. Patient's behavior was also not improved after this treatment and she further deteriorated in the sense that she exhibited mutism, negativism and psychosocial withdrawal. Psychiatric analysis was done and she was found to be having catatonia and on further investigation came out to be a case of SLE. Keeping in mind her previous history of joint pains, oral ulcers and alopecia her autoimmune profile such as ANA and dsDNA was done that came out to be positive. Patient responded to treatment with steroids, Hyroxychloroquine and azathioprine in addition to clonazepam and fluoxetine for her catatonic behavior. Thus this case history illustrates the importance of considering organic disease in patients presenting with catatonia.

Abstract: Adjunctive use of methylphenidate, a central stimulant, has been considered as a potential therapeutic choice for patients with refractory unipolar, geriatric, or bipolar depression, and depression secondary to medical illness. We present a case of bipolar depression in which the patient responded significantly to augmentation with methylphenidate, without any side effects, after failure of adjunctive repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroconvulsive therapy. Mr U, a 56-year-old man with bipolar I disorder, had melancholic symptoms during his sixth episode of bipolar depression. After failure of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroconvulsive therapy, he was treated with fluoxetine 80 mg/day, duloxetine 360 mg/day, mirtazapine 60 mg/day, and sodium valproate 1,000 mg/day, with no improvement. We added methylphenidate at a dose of 10 mg/day for one week, which resulted in mild clinical improvement, and then methylphenidate extended-release 20 mg/day for one week, with significant clinical improvement. He tolerated his medications well. His clinical recovery was stable over one year. The patient's antidepressants and methylphenidate were gradually tapered and finally discontinued after one year with no withdrawal syndrome. To date, he remains well on sodium valproate as monotherapy and is being followed up at our bipolar department. This case suggests that methylphenidate augmentation might be a therapeutic option when treating highly treatment-resistant patients with bipolar depression, even if they had not responded to adjunctive neuromodulation. In these clinical situations, physicians might be interested in prescribing methylphenidate because of its efficacy and safety.

Abstract: Although cases of Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI) induced akathisia have often been reported in literature, this adverse effect has not adequately been mentioned in major pharmacology textbooks. As a result, SSRIinduced akathisia is very frequently under-recognized. A review of literature showed that almost all frequently used SSRIs such as Fluvoxamine, Fluoxetine, Sertraline, Citalopram have been reported to be causing akathisia. SSRI-induced restless legs syndrome and movement disorders have also been reported. However, Escitalopram-induced akathisia is rare. In our review of literature, we could find only one single case of Escitalopram-induced severe akathisia. And this specific SSRI drug has rarely been implicated with occurrence of restless legs syndrome and extra-pyramidal side-effects like dytonia etc. Here, we present a case of Escitalopram-induced severe akathisia - a 53year old female, who had developed severe akathisia after taking Escitalopram for a few days. According to the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS), her Global Clinical Assessment of Akathisia Score was 5 i.e. severe akathisia. As per Naronjo Adverse Drug Reaction Scale the probability of association of this adverse reaction with Escitalopram was 7 (i.e. probable). Her symptoms continued in spite of prompt discontinuation of the drug. But, she improved rapidly with the use of Propranolol and Clonazepam. On the last follow-up, she was free from any symptoms. As new generation antidepressants are rarely associated with extra-pyramidal symptoms, the recognition of such adverse effects requires a high index of suspicion. Early recognition of the symptoms and discontinuation of the offending agent along with supportive therapy like a short course of benzodiazepines, beta-adrenergic antagonists or anticholinergics may rapidly relieve the patient from this distressing symptom.

Abstract: Obsessive-compulsive disorder is a chronic and disabling condition that often proves to be treatment resistant. Of the patients suffering from obsessive-compulsive disorder, 10%-27% may attempt suicide at least once in their life. We report the case of a patient who presented severe obsessive-compulsive disorder symptoms and attempted suicide ingesting 25 tablets of fluoxetine (20 mg). The patient was treated with venlafaxine and agomelatine and showed improvement of obsessive symptoms and suicidal ideation. Future studies are needed to investigate this treatment regime in large cohorts of obsessive-compulsive disorder patients with suicidal ideation.

Abstract: Methylene blue inhibits the nitric oxide-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (NO-cGMP) pathway, decreasing vasodilation and increasing responsiveness to vasopressors. It is reported to improve haemodynamics in distributive shock from various causes including septicaemia and post-cardiac surgery. Reports of use in overdose are limited. We describe the use of methylene blue to treat a case of refractory distributive shock following a mixed drug poisoning.
A 41-year-old male presented following reported ingestion of 18 g extended-release quetiapine, 10 g controlled-release carbamazepine, 240 mg fluoxetine, 35 g enteric-coated sodium valproate and 375 mg oxazepam. He was comatose and intubated on presentation. Progressive hypotension developed. Echocardiogram revealed a hyperdynamic left ventricle, suggesting distributive shock. The patient remained hypotensive despite intravenous fluid boluses, escalating vasopressor infusions. Arterial blood gas revealed metabolic acidaemia and high lactate. Methylene blue was administered as loading-dose of 1.5 mg/kg and continuous infusion (1.5 mg/kg/h for 12 h, then 0.75 mg/kg/h for 12 h) resulting in rapid improvement in haemodynamic parameters and weaning of vasopressors. Serum quetiapine concentration was 18600 ng/mL (30-160 ng/mL), collected at the time of peak toxicity.
Severe quetiapine poisoning produces hypotension primarily from alpha-adrenoreceptor antagonism. Methylene blue may have utility in the treatment of distributive shock resulting from poisoning refractory to standard vasopressor therapy.

Abstract: We report on a patient with type 1 diabetes mellitus who presented with recurrent episodes of hypoglycemia and a marked reduction in her daily insulin requirements after introduction of fluoxetine. This 25-year-old Caucasian woman had been followed up at the outpatient clinic for type 1 diabetes mellitus and pre-pregnancy care. She used a continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion with lispro and her daily insulin dose was 0.5 IU/kg per day. She had no chronic diabetic complications or hypoglycemia unawareness. Fluoxetine at a daily dose of 20 mg had been started because of depressive symptoms and within one week, she presented recurrent hypoglycemic episodes that prompted a progressive reduction in the insulin dose down to 0.3 IU/kg per day. The reduced insulin requirements continued during the period of fluoxetine treatment while glycated hemoglobin remained stable. She had no concurrent additional cause to explain the reduced insulin requirements. After fluoxetine was stopped, insulin requirements progressively increased and returned to the patient´s usual dose.

Abstract: A classic case of the bulimia nervosa in a young Indian female is reported. This is in the context of the impression that due to increasing western influence, and change in cultural concepts of beauty and thinness among women, illnesses previously considered rare in Indian subcontinent might be becoming more prevalent. Many of the established pre-disposing factors such as female gender, metropolitan domicile, family history of depressive disorder have conglomerated in this case. Rapid and sustained improvement with the low-dose Fluoxetine and the Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is also worth paid attention.

Abstract: We examined forensic serum toxicology and pharmacogenomics data from a woman on codeine shortly before she caused a motor vehicle accident.
A woman driving erratically collided with a parked car of a highway seriously injuring 2 men working to repair the parked vehicle. The woman tested positive for codeine, acetaminophen and barbital. She had been taking these medications for 20 years due to migraine headache. Serum toxicology and genotype analysis for cytochrome P450, UDP glucuronosyltransferase, and other metabolizing enzymes were measured.
The woman was tried and convicted of driving under the influence resulting in bodily harm and was sentenced to 6 years. Toxicology results on peripheral blood showed a total and free codeine of 840 and 348 μg/L, respectively, and total morphine of 20 μg/L (17, 3, and 0 μg/L for morphine-3-glucuronide, morphine-6-glucuronide, and free morphine, respectively). She was heterozygous for CYP 2D6 *2/*4 (extensive/poor metabolism) and heterozygous for UGT 2B7 *1/*2 (extensive/ultra-rapid metabolism). The woman was also taking fluoxetine and bupropion which are strong inhibitors of CYP 2D6.
Based on her genotype and phenotype and reports by the arresting officer, we suggest that the subject in question was not intoxicated by opiates at the time of her motor vehicle accident and may have been falsely incarcerated.

Abstract: Victims of child sexual abuse (CSA) often experience symptoms such as recurrent nightmares, which affect their adult life.
This study aimed to evaluate the effect of psychotherapy on the quality of life and sleep in a female patient with a previous history of CSA.
The patient was climacteric (menopausal transition) and treated in an outpatient clinic. She underwent 40 sessions of psychotherapy and was evaluated before and after the sessions using questionnaires and polysomnography (PSG).
Measurements were taken using the following: Kupperman Index (KI), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Prospective and Retrospective Memory Questionnaire, and PSG. Reports of dream content were also evaluated during the study.
After psychotherapeutic intervention, the frequency of nightmares and their attendant suffering decreased. Additionally, the context of the nightmares changed, and a decrease was noted in the KI, BAI, and BDI parameters. The PSG indicated an increase in rapid eye movement sleep.
Psychotherapeutic intervention combined with zolpidem and fluoxetine treatment contributed to a resignification of the dreams of a patient with a history of CSA. The treatment also improved the quality of her dreams and her quality of life.

Abstract: Drug-induced long QT syndrome is generally ascribed to inhibition of the cardiac rapid delayed rectifier potassium current (IKr). Effects on the slow delayed rectifier potassium current (IKs) are less recognized. Triggered by a patient who carried the K422T mutation in KCNQ1 (encoding the α-subunit of the IKs channel), who presented with excessive QT prolongation and high serum levels of norfluoxetine, we investigated the effects of fluoxetine and its metabolite norfluoxetine on IKs.
ECG data from mutation carriers and noncarriers revealed that the K422T mutation per se had mild clinical effects. Patch clamp studies, performed on HEK293 cells, showed that heterozygously expressed K422T KCNQ1/KCNE1 channels had a positive shift in voltage dependence of activation and an increase in deactivation rate. Fluoxetine and its metabolite norfluoxetine both inhibited KCNQ1/KCNE1 current, with norfluoxetine being the most potent. Moreover, norfluoxetine increased activation and deactivation rates. Computer simulations of the effects of norfluoxetine on IKs and IKr demonstrated significant action potential prolongation, to which IKs block contributed importantly. Although the effects of the mutation per se were small, additional IKs blockade by norfluoxetine resulted in more prominent QTc prolongation in mutation carriers than in noncarriers, demonstrating synergistic effects of innate and drug-induced IKs blockade on QTc prolongation.
IKs blockade contributes importantly to drug-induced long QT syndrome, especially when repolarization reserve is reduced. Drug safety tests might have to include screening for IKs blockade.

Abstract: To report the development of morbilliform rash and serotonin toxicity after the addition of milnacipran to a patient's medication therapy.
A 57-year-old white female presented to the emergency department because of a full-body morbilliform rash, which appeared 9 days after initiation of milnacipran 50 mg twice daily. In the emergency department the patient's vital signs were: heart rate 121 beats/min, blood pressure 180/100 mm Hg, and temperature 38.9 °C. The patient reported diarrhea, nausea, dizziness, restlessness, and increased muscle pain. Her history included recurrent breast cancer first diagnosed in 1999, hypertension, fibromyalgia, depression, osteopenia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, insomnia, and endometriosis. Her home medications included milnacipran, fluoxetine, alprazolam, zolpidem, zoledronic acid, anastrozole, doxepin, ranitidine, levocetirizine, doxazosin, tramadol, vitamin D, and ferrous gluconate. The patient's increased heart rate, blood pressure, and temperature, as well as restlessness, self-reported diarrhea and nausea, and self-reported increase in muscle pain, indicated serotonin toxicity. Milnacipran, fluoxetine, and tramadol were discontinued, while doxepin was continued. Treatment consisted of acetaminophen, diphenhydramine, methylprednisolone, promethazine, and hydralazine 10 mg intravenously. The following morning all vital signs were within normal limits and the patient's diarrhea, nausea, dizziness, restlessness, and muscle pain resolved. She was discharged the following morning. The rash had resolved after day 2 of hospital discharge, which was the fourth day after discontinuation of milnacipran.
Given the patient's symptoms, the timing of symptom onset, the patient's history, and findings on physical examination, as well as use of the Naranjo probability scale, milnacipran was deemed the probable cause of the morbilliform reaction and serotonin toxicity. Only 1 case report of rash and 2 case reports of serotonin syndrome associated with milnacipran have been reported.
It is important to increase awareness of the possibility of developing morbilliform rash and serotonin toxicity with milnacipran therapy, as both conditions can be associated with poor outcomes if not detected early and treated appropriately.

Abstract: We present a case report of novel variants of CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 identified in a patient who experienced adverse effects during antidepressant therapy. CYP2D6 DNA sequencing revealed that the patient was most likely an intermediate metabolizer, owing to the presence of a novel variant (2579C>T), which gives rise to a premature stop codon in exon 5. Because defects in CYP2C19 may also be important, we sequenced the promoter region and all exons of CYP2C19 and identified a cluster of three novel variants (-13G>A, 7C>T and 10T>C) around exon 1, as well as the more common CYP2C19*2 allele. The presence of multiple genetic lesions in CYP2C19 implies that this patient is potentially a CYP2C19 poor metabolizer, and this was confirmed by haplotype analysis. Combined impairment of CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 activities, we believe, may have contributed to the development of the observed drug responses in the present report.

Abstract: Slow channel congenital myasthenic syndrome is caused by a genetically determined kinetic anomaly of the acetylcholine receptor at the neuromuscular junction leading to its prolonged open state. Patients typically present with fatigability and static weakness of neck, hand and finger extensors. The open-channel blockers fluoxetine and quinidine have been used as standard treatment, although the former is limited by its side effects. We describe a patient with a novel "de novo" mutation in the α subunit of acetylcholine receptor with clinical and electrophysiological hallmarks of the disease. The patient showed marked treatment response to fluoxetine as well as quinine, a stereoisomer of quinidine, expanding the treatment options for this hereditary disorder.

Abstract: Pica refers to eating of non-nutritious substances, which is usually seen in childhood or pregnancy. Here we report a case of an illiterate tribal woman who developed pica as the sole manifestation of obsessive compulsive disorder, with onset during pregnancy. The patient had compulsions of eating uncooked rice or wheat, which resulted in toothache and abdominal discomfort. She had this habit in three pregnancies, consecutively. In the first two pregnancies it resolved spontaneously after puerperium, but persisted in the last one. Probably physical stress of limb edema during the third pregnancy was reason for the persistence. She responded to fluoxetine 40 mg / day after three months of treatment, without behavioral therapy. We conclude that pica may either be only a manifestation of obsessive compulsive disorder during pregnancy or it is an obsessive compulsive spectrum disorder.

Abstract: 3,4-Methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV) is a psychoactive, synthetic analog of the central nervous system stimulant cathinone. Its recent popularity as a recreational drug in the United States has led to numerous reports to poison control centers across the country. As with other synthetic cathinones, the recreational use of MDPV has resulted in death. MDPV is thought to exert its pharmacologic effects by inhibiting the reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine. This report describes the case of an exposure of a 39-year-old male to MDPV, which resulted in his death. Postmortem concentrations of MDPV in various tissues were measured. The detection of MDPV in tissues and fluids was accomplished using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis after solid-phase extraction. Blood analysis also demonstrated therapeutic levels of lamotrigine, fluoxetine, risperidone, benztropine, pseudoephedrine and ibuprofen. The detection of cathinones in hair was conducted using high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry after solid-phase extraction. MDPV was uniformly distributed among multiple tissues (blood, brain, muscle, cerebrospinal fluid and lung) at concentrations of approximately 0.4 to 0.6 µg/mL. Tissue and fluids responsible for detoxification/excretion had higher concentrations of MDPV (kidney, liver and bile > 0.8 µg/mL). A blood concentration ≥ 0.4 µg/mL was judged sufficient to cause death. The cause of death was ruled MDPV intoxication resulting in cardiac arrhythmia.

Abstract: A patient who manifested signs of serotonin syndrome during an intravenous anesthetic with remifentanil and propofol is presented. The patient displayed lower extremity clonus, nystagmus, and diaphoresis. At the time of surgery, the patient was being treated with fluoxetine (a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor). A presumptive diagnosis of serotonin syndrome was made intraoperatively and all opioids were discontinued. His symptoms resolved in the Postanesthesia Care Unit without incident.

Abstract: Major depression is a common and debilitating illness. Over recent years, new pharmacologic treatments have been approved for this disorder, including the atypical antipsychotics. One of the benefits of these medications is their significant efficacy as augmenting agents for unipolar, nonpsychotic major depressive disorder (MDD).Aripiprazole (marketed as Abilify, Bristol-Myers Squibb/ Otsuka Pharmaceuticals) was the first medication of this class approved for adjunctive treatment of MDD, and is the 5th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States in 2010. However, despite the frequency of its use, little has been described regarding events surrounding aripiprazole discontinuation. Here I describe what is, to my knowledge, the first reported case of an aripiprazole discontinuation syndrome. While directly relevant to psychiatrists and behavioral specialists, the symptoms described here are pertinent for internists and neurologists who may encounter this medication in their clinical practice.

Abstract: About 2% of the adult population has chronic migraine with only 20% diagnosed with this disorder. Those with medication overuse may improve with withdrawal of overuse medications. The intravenous dihydroergotamine regimen usually produces short-term benefit for those with medically refractory chronic migraine. OnabotulinumtoxinA and topiramate have shown efficacy in large placebo-controlled randomized trials. Sodium valproate, gabapentin, tizanidine, amitriptyline, fluoxetine, zonisamide, and possibly memantine may be alternative or possibly combined treatment options but with lesser levels of evidence supporting their use. Preliminary evidence suggests that nerve blocks might be beneficial. Acupuncture, biofeedback, relaxation therapy, and cognitive behavioral therapy might be of benefit. Surgical treatments including bariatric and deactivation of trigger points are of growing interest but not appropriate for most sufferers. Occipital nerve stimulation is a promising treatment with ongoing studies defining its use.

Abstract: This clinical case report shows how important it is for a psychiatrist to have a knowledge of the cultural and religious context of the patient, in order to understand fully his or her complaints. Culture and religion, in fact, are not neutral, but convey symbols, meanings, and myths that should be properly explored to shed light on the patient's inner world. Patient D was a 19-year-old Muslim Italo-Tunisian girl, who consulted a psychiatrist for anxiety and panic attacks, and reported being possessed by djinns (ie, "evil creatures", as described in the Qur'an). A culturally informed interview was carried out, together with administration of psychometric scales, including the Symptom Checklist-90 Revised and Psychological Measure of Islamic Religiousness. Based on her scores and the results of this multidimensional assessment, patient D was treated with transcultural psychotherapy and fluoxetine. After a year of follow-up, she reported no further episodes of panic disorder. For proper assessment and treatment, a combined anthropological, sociological, and psychopathological approach was necessary.

Abstract: Slow channel congenital myasthenic syndrome is a dominant disorder characterized by prolonged acetylcholine receptor ion-channel activation.
Molecular genetic techniques, electrophysiology, and binding studies in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells determined mutant function and expression levels. Patient response to treatment was measured by quantitative myasthenic gravis and Medical Research Council grade strength scores.
We report an unusual case due to heteroallelic mutations in CHRNE. The slow channel mutation, p.εS278del, is accompanied by a severe low-expression mutation, p.εR217L, on the second allele. Expression studies and cosegregation of p.εS278del with the disorder in the patient's offspring demonstrate robust expression of the p.εS278del mutation. The patient showed modest benefits from standard treatment with fluoxetine, but there was dramatic improvement when salbutamol was combined with fluoxetine.
This case suggests that salbutamol, which is beneficial in some other congenital myasthenic syndromes, might also be considered in addition to fluoxetine in slow channel syndrome.

Abstract: Hoarding is defined as the excessive collection and failure to discard possessions of apparently little value, leading to clutter, distress, and disability. Although patients with hoarding typically may feel ludicrous for not discarding useless, and sometimes bizarre, possessions, we are not aware of any previous description of patients displaying hoarding as a result of social anxiety.
Single case report.
In this article, we describe a patient with severe social anxiety disorder who displayed hoarding as a direct consequence of social anxiety-related beliefs and atypical safety behaviors.
This case is of particular interest to current debates concerning the status of hoarding in new versions of classificatory systems. It also indicates that social anxiety disorder should be included in the list of conditions that needs to be excluded in order to diagnose "primary" hoarding disorder.

Abstract: There is limited literature reporting galactorrhea with antidepressants including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). In this case report, I present a case of a young female who developed galactorrhea with sertraline, which improved on discontinuation of sertraline. Computer-assisted searches on galactorrhea with SSRIs yielded 23 cases, mostly with escitalopram and paroxetine and rarely with fluoxetine, fluvoxamine and sertraline, and it may be much more frequent than recognized.

Abstract: Kleptomania is an impulse control disorder characterized by a recurrent failure to resist the impulse to steal worthless objects that are not needed for personal use. Very little is known about the etiology, prevalence and treatment. This disorder usually begins during puberty and lasts until late adulthood. In some patients, it may last throughout the person's life. Patients with kleptomania are likely to suffer from comorbid conditions like mood disorders. The patients usually seek treatment for the comorbid psychiatric complaints, rather than the kleptomaniac behavior itself. The literature lacks sufficient knowledge and controlled studies about the treatment of kleptomania. Regarding the treatment of SSRIs, there are case reports and case series, using mood stabilizers, antipsychotics and opioid antagonists. Cognitive behavioral therapy techniques are also used in the treatment of kleptomania. In this study, a female patient is presented with diminishing kleptomaniac symptoms after naltrexone is added to her cognitive behavioral therapy and fluoxetine treatment. She also suffers from the comorbidities of major depressive disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder.

Abstract: A 50-year-old, white female patient was diagnosed with schizophrenia in her teens. Her illness did not respond adequately to treatment until she was placed on a combination of fluoxetine and conventional antipsychotics. She discontinued the conventional antipsychotics on a number of occasions, which caused her to become psychotic, but not manic. On two separate occasions she was placed on atypical antipsychotics that were associated with the occurrence of manic symptoms. Once the patient was restarted on conventional antipsychotics, she remained stable.

Abstract: Trends in forensic toxicology show the introduction of rapid analytical methods for the simultaneous quantitative analysis of drugs. The authors present a fatal case involving a 32-year-old male, found dead in bed by his mother, with several blue, white and orange pills next to the body. Empty tablets were found in the trash bin and a suicide note was on the desk. He was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and had been under psychiatric treatment, having repeatedly demonstrated intent to commit suicide. A rapid method was developed to determine 55 different medicines and 32 benzodiazepines in blood by ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) with electrospray ionization source in positive and negative ion mode. Chromatographic analysis was preceded by an optimized solid-phase extraction procedure using Oasis(®) HLB (3 cc, 60 mg) extraction columns. The extracted analytes were separated by UPLC (Waters) with a reversed-phase Acquity UPLC(®) HSS T3 (2.1×100 mm id, 1.8 μm) column with acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid in water as mobile phase, at 0.5 mL/min flow rate and a chromatographic run-time of 8 min. Analytes detection was achieved with a triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer in positive and negative electrospray ionization mode with multiple reaction monitoring (MRM). Two MRM transitions were monitored for each target-compound and one for each deuterated internal standards. Toxicological results showed high blood concentrations of antipsychotics (haloperidol, olanzapine and quetiapine), antidepressants (fluoxetine and paroxetine) and anxiolytics (bromazepam and lorazepam). Risperidone and other benzodiazepines were also present in therapeutic concentrations. Neither alcohol nor illicit drugs were present in the analyzed samples. The UPLC-MS-MS method showed to be appropriate for screening, identification and quantitation of antipsychotics, antidepressants, anxiolytics and antiepileptic drugs in blood after intake of therapeutic as well as toxic doses. The autopsy and toxicological results led the pathologist to rule that death was due to a mixed-drug intoxication. The manner of death was determined to be suicide.

Abstract: Congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS) are rare genetically and clinically heterogeneous disorders characterized by an impaired neuromuscular transmission. Exact prevalence data are not available, approximately 2000 to 3000 patients worldwide have been diagnosed on a molecular level; mutations in 14 different genes are known to date leading to causal defects in presynaptic nerve terminal, synaptic cleft, and postsynaptic apparatus. At last, all known mutations are estimated to cause approximately 50% of all clinically diagnosed CMS. However, phenotypes may vary widely and symptoms can be unspecific, therefore CMS are often missed and their prevalence may be underestimated. But, the exact diagnosis is extremely important to start early appropriate therapy to prevent life-threatening events and to improve the clinical course. Most patients are eligible for drug therapy with esterase inhibitors, 3, 4-diaminopyridine, ephedrine, fluoxetine or quinidine, but the effect of these drugs differs depending on the underlying genetic defect. Moreover, very little is known about the best treatment and care in these patients over a longer period of time.This article provides an overview of specific clinical symptoms, diagnostic work-up, and care including possible pharmacotherapy in case of CMS.

Abstract: Pallid breath-holding (PBH) is a childhood condition that presents with recurrent syncope. Although typically benign, severe cases can lead to asystole and anoxic seizures. Previous studies have advocated pacemaker placement to abbreviate symptoms. This was a retrospective study of patients treated with fluoxetine for PBH spells. Clinical response, side effects and avoidance of pacemaker implantation were reviewed in six patients (12-60 months) treated with fluoxetine for PBH. Patients were referred because of concern of arrhythmia and failed medical treatment strategies. Two patients had previously implanted loop recorders, 5 patients had documented episodes of asystole, and 2 patients had generalized seizures. Fluoxetine resulted in alleviation of syncope in 5 of 6 patients. Time to symptomatic improvement symptoms ranged from 2 days to 1 month (median, 2 weeks). Median duration of treatment with fluoxetine was 12 months (12-24 months). One patient demonstrated no improvement and had a pacemaker implanted. There were no reported side effects to fluoxetine. Fluoxetine can be used to treat childhood PBH spells and may obviate the need for permanent pacing in a significant subset of this population. Considering its safe side-effect profile it is a worthwhile first-line agent to treat this disorder.

Abstract: Spasmophemia, also called stuttering or stammering, is a speech disorder characterized by impairment of the rhythm of words whose classical symptoms are blocks and repetitions.
We describe the case of a male patient, his evolution and therapeutic strategies and review the current literature on the subject.
A 33-year-old patient was referred to our Mental Health Unit by his family doctor due to “speech problems and difficulty expressing ideas. His symptoms had worsened in recent weeks, with increase in his state of anxiety.” Standing out in the consultation to the doctor, the patient experienced multiple blocks in expressing words, using circumlocutions and monosyllabic repetitions that made it very difficult to conduct the interview. Anticipatory anxiety and occasional obsessions of repeated checking also stand out. After six weeks of treatment with olanzapine 5 mg/daily, the patient showed significant improvement both in the fluency and anticipatory anxiety with decreased repetitions, blocking, interjections and broken words.
Spasmophemia has been associated with dopaminergic hyperactivity, so that studies have been conducted with atypical antipsychotics. Fundamentally, olanzapine and risperidone have revealed promising results. Furthermore, several studies have shown that these patients have higher rates of anxiety. That is why antidepressants and antianxiety drugs such as clomipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, citalopram, sertraline and alprazolam have been used.
Treatment with olanzapine, 5HT-2 and D1/ D2 antagonist, significantly improved the clinical picture as Boyd et al. have described in their systematic review.

Abstract: Syncope is a transient loss of consciousness, associated with loss of postural tone, with spontaneous return to baseline neurologic function. Syncope is a common complaint in the emergency department.
Cough syncope occurs immediately after coughing. Cough syncope rapidly recovers in 1-2 second. Although cough syncope has been classified in vasovagal syncope, it may differ from pathogenetic mechanism. Physicians should be aware of this easily recognizable cough induced syncope.
We present a 59-year-old obese man was referred for clinical evaluation because of recurrent syncope without seizures following coughing who developed cough syncope.
Physicians should be aware of this easily recognizable cough induced syncope in all subjects admitted with syncope and should screen possible underlying sources of cough.

Abstract: Rett syndrome is a severe neurodevelopmental disease with a prevalence of 0.88 per 10,000 girls aged 5-18 years, and is often caused by mutations in methyl-cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG)-binding protein 2. Disorder of respiratory control is a prominent feature of Rett syndrome. Brainstem serotoninergic neurons are known to play an important role in the arrangement of breathing rhythm and pattern. We present a patient whose severe hyperventilation and apneic attacks resolved with the concomitant treatment of fluoxetine and buspirone. To our knowledge, we describe the first patient with Rett syndrome to receive fluoxetine for respiratory problems.

Abstract: To report 6 cases of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)-associated apathy syndrome.
In all 6 cases, the patient reported loss of motivation while being treated with an SSRI. Loss of motivation was of new onset and temporally associated with the use of the SSRI. A trial of discontinuation of the SSRI was performed in all 6 patients and 2 were started on bupropion while cross-tapering from the SSRI. During the treatment trials, depression and apathy were monitored in all patients. Each case was assessed using the Apathy Evaluation Scale, Clinician version (AES-C), and by evaluating how the patient responded to discontinuation of the SSRI.
Scores on the AES-C improved significantly in all 6 cases after the SSRI was discontinued. Improvement was also seen in the motivation, novelty, and persistence subdomain scores of the AES-C. A pretreatment AES-C score was available only in the first case. Based on the Naranjo probability scale, there was a probable cause of apathy syndrome with SSRI therapy in the first case and a possible association in the rest of the cases.
In some patients SSRIs may cause an apathy syndrome that can be reversed through discontinuation of the agent. When evaluating patients being treated with an SSRI, clinicians should have a high degree of suspicion and specifically inquire for this iatrogenic form of apathy syndrome.

Abstract: Self-mutilating behaviors could be minor and benign, but more severe cases are usually associated with psychiatric disorders or with acquired nervous system lesions and could be life-threatening. The patient was a 66-year-old man who had been mutilating his fingers for 6 years. This behavior started as serious nail biting and continued as severe finger mutilation (by biting), resulting in loss of the terminal phalanges of all fingers in both hands. On admission, he complained only about insomnia. The electromyography showed severe peripheral nerve damage in both hands and feet caused by severe diabetic neuropathy. Cognitive decline was not established (Mini Mental State Examination score, 28), although the computed tomographic scan revealed serious brain atrophy. He was given a diagnosis of impulse control disorder not otherwise specified. His impulsive biting improved markedly when low doses of haloperidol (1.5 mg/day) were added to fluoxetine (80 mg/day). In our patient's case, self-mutilating behavior was associated with severe diabetic neuropathy, impulsivity, and social isolation. The administration of a combination of an antipsychotic and an antidepressant proved to be beneficial.

Abstract: Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is an anxiety disorder which can substantially disable children's ability to function at home and school. Clinicians frequently rely on knowledge about symptoms that can be examined early in treatment to determine future treatment effectiveness. However, OCD in preschoolers has also received little attention in literature. To the best of our knowledge, there is only one retrospective chart review and one case report in the literature for preschool cases treated with SSRIs. Therefore, the effect of fluoxetine on preschool children was imprecisely understood. The aim of this case report was to examine the efficacy and safety of fluoxetine treatment for pediatric OCD. Four preschool children with OCD completed an 8-week fluoxetine (up to 20 mg) trial. We diagnosed OCD according to Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, 4th edition, text revision (DSM-IV-TR) criteria and symptoms of OCD were assessed with the Childrens' Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (CY-BOCS). Initial and post-treatment symptom severity and improvement were assessed by using the severity (S) and improvement (I) scales of Clinical Global Impressions Scale (CGI). The CY-BOCS total, obsessions and compulsions subscale scores and CGI-S scores were significantly improved for all of the cases at the end of the eighth week. In this case report four preschool children, with severe OCD and resistant to the previous non-psychopharmacologic treatment responded well to fluoxetine monotherapy. On the other hand, the usage of SSRIs in preschool children remains highly controversial, due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy.

Abstract: Brain MRI and ¹⁸F-FDG PET/CT scans were performed in a patient who had survived a suicide attempt by fluoxetine overdose. The patient presented with the following clinical signs and symptoms, and neuroimaging findings: severe signs of serotonin toxicity, including comatose state, akinetic rigid syndrome and dysautonomia; bilateral globus pallidus changes consistent with extensive pallidal necrosis and subsequent reversible diffuse ischemic changes in white matter, with posterior predominance, involving the splenium of the corpus callosum on brain MRI; and marked hypometabolism in the frontal, parietal and temporal cortical regions as well as in both caudate nuclei on ¹⁸F-FDG PET/CT performed 37 days later. These findings suggest that acute severe serotonin toxicity can induce structural and long-standing functional changes in multiple cortical and subcortical brain regions that are associated with cognitive and extrapyramidal syndromes.

Abstract: Both moclobemide and fluoxetine are used in the treatment of depression, and have been shown to produce fewer side effects than conventional tricyclic antidepressants. A combination of moclobemide and fluoxetine has been used in refractory depression, however there is potential for severe serotonin toxicity. We describe a lethal case of serotonin toxicity in a 36 year-old woman after she ingested multiple drugs, including moclobemide 4500 mg, fluoxetine 200 mg, propranolol 300 mg and several benzodiazepines. The clinical features included coma, mydriasis, hyperthermia, tremor, hyperreflexia, rhabdomyolysis, renal failure and respiratory insufficiency. Eventually, the patient died of disseminated intravascular coagulation and circulatory collapse at 22.5 h postingestion. Toxicological analysis of the patient's blood confirmed high levels of moclobemide 150 μg/mL (therapeutic 1-3 μg/mL), fluoxetine 3750 ng/mL (therapeutic 47-469 ng/mL) and several benzodiazepines. In conclusion, a combination of moclobemide and fluoxetine should be avoided in depressed patients with high suicidal tendencies. Moreover, early recognition and aggressive intervention are the mainstays in the management of potentially life-threatening serotonin toxicity.

Abstract: Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is an autosomal recessive, lipid storage disorder which is extremely rare in the Chinese population. It is characterized by progressive neurologic dysfunction and enlargement of tendon xanthomas, and is often accompanied with neuropsychiatric symptoms. Few reports are available regarding depression and antidepressant medication in CTX patients. Here, we report a Chinese case of CTX associated with fluoxetine-responsive major depression.

Abstract: Delirium is a common cause for hospital admission among elderly patients. Although infection is the most common explanation, there is a large number of other potential causes. We present a case of acute delirium due to serotonin syndrome, precipitated by concomitant prescription of clarithromycin and fluoxetine. The symptoms improved following treatment with a benzodiazepine and discontinuation of the fluoxetine. The diagnosis and management of serotonin syndrome is discussed.

Abstract: Depression is common in patients with ischemic heart disease. According to mental health survey approximately one fifth of the patients with angiographic evidence of coronary artery disease have major depression. It is well recognized that stigmatization of mental disorders leads to stigmatized individuals to avoid treatment or to conceal treatment. We report a case of serotonin syndrome that occurred during postoperative period in a patient who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting. The patient was receiving 60 mg/day fluoxetine since the last four years which she and her attendants concealed during the preoperative evaluation. To our knowledge this is the first case in a postoperative patient reported in biomedical literature. We suggest that history taking should be done with special emphasis on antidepressant drug intake in patients suffering from coronary artery disease. If serotonin syndrome occurs in these patients aggressive and timely management can save the patient.

Abstract: Selective mutism is rare with a prevalence below 1% in the general population, but a higher prevalence in populations at risk (children with speech retardation, migration). Evidence for treatment strategies is hardly available. This case report provides information on the treatment of selective mutism in an 8-year-old girl with preexisting thalassaemia major. As medications she received penicillin prophylaxis (500000 IE/d) and deferasirox (Exjade; 20-25mg/kg/d), an iron chelator. The preexisting somatic disease and treatment complicated the treatment, as there are no data about pharmacological combination therapy. Psychotherapy in day treatment, supported by the use of the SSRI fluoxetine (10 mg), led to a decrease in the selective mutism score from 33 to 12 points, GAF improved by 21 points. Mean levels of fluoxetine plus norfluoxetine were 287.8 ng/ml without significant level fluctuations.

Abstract: Persistent developmental stuttering (PDS) is a common disorder of speech with no identifiable cause. Psychiatric disorders appear to be related and influence clinical manifestation of PDS. In this case report, we present the clinical evolution of 1 PDS patient submitted to pharmacological treatment with fluoxetine and speech therapy intervention. At the end of 12 weeks of treatment, she evolved from 28 at Beck Depression Inventory; 32 in the Hamilton Scale for Anxiety; 43 and 47, respectively, in the anxiety and avoidance components of the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale; and severe speech impairment according Iowa Scale, to 12 at Beck Depression Inventory; 8 at Hamilton Scale for Anxiety; 25 and 21 at Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale anxiety and avoidance components, respectively; and moderate speech impairment. Diagnosing and treating psychiatric symptoms in addition to speech therapy appears to be the best therapeutic approach.

Abstract: Depression is common in patients with ischemic heart disease. According to mental health surveys, approximately one-fifth of the patients with angiographic evidence of coronary artery disease have major depression.[1] It is well-recognized that stigma associated with mental disorders leads to individuals avoiding treatment or concealing treatment for them. We report a case of serotonin syndrome that occurred during postoperative period in a patient who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting. The patient was receiving 60 mg/day fluoxetine for the last 4 years, which she and her attendants concealed during the preoperative evaluation. To our knowledge this is the first case of serotonin syndrome, reported in biomedical literature, in a postoperative patient. We suggest that history taking should also focus on antidepressant drug intake by patients. If serotonin syndrome occurs in such patients aggressive and timely management can help avert mortality.

Abstract: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common neurobehavioral disorders of childhood and adolescence. Classically, stimulants have been used in the treatment of this condition. Atomoxetine (Strattera; Eli Lilly and Company) is a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), one of the first medications in the nonstimulant class of medications that has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of ADHD. Atomoxetine is a phenoxypropylamine derivative and is structurally related to the antidepressant fluoxetine. The common side effects reported with the use of atomoxetine include mainly GI disturbances. Cardiovascular side effects are less commonly reported. The increase in the noradrenergic tone may explain some of the side effects noted with the use of this medication. Here, we present a case of a patient who presented with syncope, orthostatic hypotension, and tachycardia and discuss the various clinical implications based on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the drug.

Abstract: The defective platelets of end-stage renal disease patients might be further incapacitated by the antiplatelet effect of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, and bleeding tendency in these patients could be aggravated. Here we demonstrate an end-stage renal disease patient who was admitted for duodenal ulcer bleeding during the treatment with fluoxetine, and the bleeding did not stop by various active treatments until the cessation of fluoxetine.

Abstract: To evaluate the outcome of dissecting the styloid process via an extraoral approach combined with antidepressants for treating Eagle's syndrome.
Twenty-two patients with Eagle's syndrome underwent resection of the elongated styloid processes under general anaesthesia via an extraoral approach. All patients completed a self-rating depression scale preoperatively, and a score over 49 was defined as depression. The patients with depression were treated with fluoxetine 20 mg/day for 3 weeks postoperatively. In all patients, the abnormal length of the styloid process was resected.
No surgical complications were observed. Eighteen (81.8%) patients had depression, and all 22 patients were followed for 7 to 26 months: 19 were symptom-free (86.4%), two patients with mild or moderate depression obtained almost complete remission of their symptoms, and one patient with severe depression obtained partial remission. No complications of medication occurred in any patient with depression, and all patients had a satisfactory cosmetic result and no paraesthesia.
Dissection of the styloid process via an extraoral approach is simple and reliable; dissection of the styloid process combined with antidepressants (fluoxetine) is preferred for treating Eagle's syndrome.

Abstract: We report a case of a potential drug-drug interaction in a woman treated by a first injection of high-dose methotrexate for a T-lymphoblastic lymphoma. Valaciclovir, fluoxetine and pantoprazole were given concomitantly. A methotrexate overdosage was shown at 36 h after infusion associated with a severe renal failure. Alkaline hyperhydration, folinic acid and carboxypeptidase G2 were given. Prescription analyses by pharmacists and literature research have permitted us to suggest that a drug-drug interaction between methotrexate and proton pump inhibitors (PPI) was responsible for this renal failure. Several mechanisms of interaction were suggested and might be related to the inhibition of renal methotrexate transporters by PPI, an increase in the methotrexate efflux to the blood by an upregulation of multidrug resistance protein 3 by PPI or genetic polymorphisms. This case shows that pharmacists can help physicians to optimize patient treatment: they consensually decided on the systematic discontinuation of PPI or a switch to ranitidine when patients were treated by high-dose methotrexate.

Abstract: Neuropsychiatric conditions are common in patients with primary antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) with or without vascular thrombosis of the central nervous system. There are frequent descriptions of memory alterations, cognition and mood disorders, such as depression, anxiety, and even conditions of mania and psychosis preceding the diagnosis of primary APS. However, this study is the first to present primary or secondary APS associated with habit or impulse control disorders. The authors describe the case of a 53-year-old male patient who had been a pathological gambler since adulthood and who has had APS for more than 20 years. We describe the case and review its characteristics, criteria for diagnosis and treatment offered for patients with this specific subtype of impulse disorder.

Abstract: A 72-year-old Caucasian woman without remarkable medical history presented with an asymptomatic bilateral periocular swelling, which had been present for 2 months. Physical examination showed symmetric indurated periocular erythematous plaques (Figure 1). Biopsy of a skin lesion revealed aggregates of vacuoles of different sizes (Figure 2) surrounded by a prominent inflammatory infiltrate constituted by macrophages, lymphocytes, neutrophils, and granulomatous foreign body reaction throughout the reticular dermis and hypodermis. These histological findings were consistent with the injection of an oily foreign substance. The patient denied the self-induced nature of the lesions, so she was referred for psychiatric evaluation and admitted having self-injected mineral oil as an impulsive attempt to get attention from her family. She was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder (BPD) and started treatment with oral fluoxetine, showing a rapid decrease of impulsive behavior and anxiety from the second week with a mean dose of 80 mg/d.

Abstract: Frotteurism is an aberrant behaviour wherein the person tends to rub or bring about physical contact between his genitals and an unrelated female to derive sexual pleasure. Our report describes an atypical case of hypersexual behaviour presenting in the form of masturbation with features of frotteurism and unipolar depression. The paper discusses the differential diagnosis and management of hypersexual behaviour.

Abstract: No studies have compared the response to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and atypical antipsychotics in anorexia nervosa. This case study examines such a comparison.
This report describes a case of 12-year-old identical twins with anorexia nervosa, one of whom was treated with olanzapine and the other with fluoxetine, while undergoing family therapy.
Twin A treated with fluoxetine went from 75 to 84.4% ideal body weight, while Twin B treated with olanzapine went from 72 to 99.9% ideal body weight over the course of 9 months.
This case supports the need for adequately powered, controlled clinical trials to test the efficacy of olanzapine in adolescents presenting with anorexia nervosa.

Abstract: Kleine-Levin syndrome (KLS) is a rare disorder characterized by periodic hypersomnia, cognitive and behavioral disturbances. Other unique symptoms in KLS are megaphagia, hypersexuality and some psychiatric disturbances such as compulsion and depression. Definite diagnosis requires the elimination of other potential etiologies. We reported a typical case of KLS in a young Thai man who suffered from seven episodes of periodic hypersomnia within 1.5 years and eventually he was diagnosed with Kleine-Levin syndrome after excluding known possible neurological conditions and sleep disorders.

Abstract: Serotonin syndrome is a potential side effect of some psychotropic medications in common use today. With over 8000 adverse events related to this condition in 2004 alone, this risk warrants further attention. The deployed environment presents a unique set of stressors and risks involved in treatment with any psychotherapeutic agent. The following case illustrates one incidence of rapid titration of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) (fluoxetine) contributing to the emergence of serotonin syndrome.

Abstract: An older woman presented to the hospital with abdominal pain and subsequently had three episodes of melaena, requiring blood transfusions. She was known to suffer with severe depression and was on high-dose fluoxetine. Gastroscopy and colonoscopy failed to reveal an underlying cause for gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. Possibility of high-dose selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors causing GI bleed was raised. Fluoxetine was discontinued and the patient was commenced on mirtazapine. The patient had no further GI bleeding and had significant improvement in haemoglobin.

Abstract: Pill-induced oesophagitis is well reported in people of all ages (range 3-98 years), with females outnumbering males by 1.5:1. Antibiotic pills, cardiac pills and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and alendronate are the most common culprits. We report a case of fluoxetine-induced pill oesophagitis in a young adult without any underlying pathological abnormalities of the oesophagus.

Abstract: A 61-year-old woman was admitted with history of vomiting, diarrhoea and severe hyponatraemia (Na(+) 109). The cause of the hyponatraemia was due to intravascular volume depletion resulting in a non-osmotic release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) with the added effects of a thiazide diuretic. She was also on fluoxetine which may induce inappropriate secretion of ADH. Despite cautious fluid replacement, the patient's serum sodium increased by 12 mmol/l over the first 18 h (and by 10 mmol/l over 12 h). This trajectory, coupled with the rapid decrease in urine osmolality, suggested that this patient was at risk of significant brain injury due to rapid correction of serum sodium. The use of desmopressin slowed the rise in serum sodium allowing brain adaptive mechanisms time to protect against osmotic demyelination.

Abstract: Drug-related eosinophilia with systemic symptoms (DRESS) is a potentially life-threatening, multiorgan condition that can result from drug treatment. Antiepileptic medications have provided the best-studied link of any class of medications. Here, we report the case of a 16-year-old boy with long-standing bipolar disorder who was chronically treated with aripiprazole and fluoxetine and developed DRESS syndrome after ingestion of high doses of caffeine. His classic presentation with fever, morbilliform rash, lymphadenopathy, and visceral involvement, including leukocytosis, eosinophilia, and hepatitis, was consistent with this diagnosis. Furthermore, the patient's symptoms dramatically improved after corticosteroid therapy and discontinuation of all psychotropic medications. We propose that the development of DRESS syndrome is a net result of inconsistent medication adherence coupled with the ingestion of near-toxic doses of caffeine, which can lead to rhabdomyolysis and, through renal impairment, lead to the accumulation of toxic oxidative metabolites of either or both psychotropic medications. We also present one of the few reported cases of caffeine-induced rhabdomyolysis and propose its role in the development of DRESS in this patient.

Abstract: Packing therapy is an adjunct symptomatic treatment used for autism and/or catatonia. Here, we report the case of a 15-year-old boy with pervasive developmental disorder who developed catatonia. At admission, catatonic symptoms were severe and the patient required a feeding tube. Lorazepam up to 15 mg/day moderately improved the catatonic symptoms. On day 36 we added fluoxetine and on day 62 we added packing therapy (twice per week, 10 sessions). After three packing sessions, the patient showed a significant clinical improvement (P<0.001). At discharge (day 96), he was able to return to his special education program. Although we do not consider packing as a psychodynamic treatment, this case challenges the concept of embodied self that has opened new perspectives on a dialogue between psychoanalysis and neuroscience. Indeed, better body representation following packing sessions, as shown in patient's drawing, paralleled clinical improvement, and supports the concept of embodied self. This concept may serve as a link between psychoanalysis and attachment theory, developmental psychology with the early description of "sense of self", and cognitive neurosciences that more and more support the concept of embodied cognition. Further clinical studies are necessary to clarify the efficacy and underlying mechanism of packing treatment and to understand how patient's experience may illustrate the concept of embodied self.

Abstract: We report the management of a morbidly obese parturient suffering from narcolepsy with cataplexy who presented for caesarean section. Her symptoms were controlled by modafinil and fluoxetine. We administered epidural anaesthesia successfully; surgery was uneventful and recovery was uncomplicated. We discuss some of the issues surrounding parturients with narcolepsy including drug therapy and choice of anaesthetic technique.

Abstract: Goldenhar syndrome, also known as oculo-auriculo-vertebral spectrum, is a complex, heterogeneous condition characterized by abnormal prenatal development of facial structures. We present the occurrence of Goldenhar syndrome in an infant born to a woman with a history of prenatal Fluoxetine ingestion throughout her pregnancy. Because this is the first reported case associating maternal Fluoxetine intake with fetal craniofacial malformations, a potential mechanism of injury is discussed. The propositus, a male born from nonconsanguinous parents, had facial asymmetry with right microtia and mandibular hypoplasia; he also had bilateral hypoplastic macula, scoliotic deformity of the thoracic spine, and ventricular septal defect. The mother was under treatment with Fluoxetine 20 mg/day prior to conception and maintained the same dosage throughout her pregnancy. The drug is a selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor, the most widely prescribed for the treatment of depression. The occurrence of developmental aberrations may be caused by a profound serotonin receptor suppressive state in utero leading to aberrant clinical manifestations of the first and second branchial arches. Despite the very many limitations of case reporting of teratogenic events, it remains an important source of information on which more advanced research is based.

Abstract: Psoriasis is a commonly diagnosed skin disorder that requires a long-term management and can have a profound impact on the quality of life of patients. Drugs that have been associated with the precipitation or exacerbation of psoriasis include lithium, beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents and antimalarials. Despite extensive use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in clinical practice, there have been very few reports of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor-related psoriasis. The main purpose of this study was to report fluoxetine-induced psoriasis in two Chinese women.
Although both patients had been taking fluoxetine for an extended period of time, the time scale of these two case studies suggests that fluoxetine played a causative role in these patients' psoriasis.

Abstract: Catatonia is a syndrome of motor and behavioral disturbance. It is a poorly understood condition, which is underrecognized and may go untreated despite intensive medical workup and numerous unsuccessful medication trials. However, with treatments known to be effective, such as benzodiazepines and/or electroconvulsive therapy, patients may return to their baseline functioning. Autism and catatonia have been previously reported together. We report 2 patients with autism and mental retardation who developed catatonic symptoms at the onset of puberty. Both patients experienced persistent symptoms over several years and presented with a history of motor disturbance, functional decline, and episodic aggression. Both patients were treated with electroconvulsive therapy resulting in a positive response and functional improvement. Catatonia may persist as a chronic condition, lasting over several months or years, if not recognized and treated.

Abstract: A 47 year old patient has been treated for psychotic depression for the last 5 years. The illness began manifesting through the symptoms of depressive thoughts, intrapsychic tension, projectivity, derealisation phenomena and pre-psychotic fears. She was treated with a combination of antidepressives, anxiolitics and hypnotics in ambulatory conditions. The therapy applied did not obtain the effects expected due to which an atypical antipsychotic was administered subsequently - risperidone, a 2 mg dose in the evening. After commencing the antipsychotic treatment, the symptoms started to weaken and a steady remission was obtained. Two years after a regular risperidone administration (in combination with fluoxetine, alprazolam and flurazepam) the patient reported some "bleeding" in October 2006. Hormonal blood tests were performed and high prolactin values were registered (2567.0 mIJ/L),due to which a gradual risperidone retractement was indicated. Medicamentous hyperprolactinaemia is a well known side effect of risperidone. A gradual risperidone retractement lead to a lowered and normal prolactin level within a month.

Abstract: Generic formulations of medications are marketed as therapeutically equivalent and less expensive than branded ones. Multiple studies and case reports have described relapses and worsening clinical outcome in patients after a switch from a brand name to a generic medication. Recent studies have shown that generics do not always lead to the expected costs savings, reducing the impetus to proceed with compulsory generic switching. We report on three patients who experienced clinical deterioration after commencing the generic formulation of their previous brand name psychotropic medication. We discuss key clinical differences between original and generic formulations of the same medication. The use of bioequivalence as an indicator of therapeutic and clinical equivalence, the lack of appropriate studies comparing generic and brand name medications and differences in excipients are some of the factors that could explain variation in clinical response between generic and brand name medications. Generic switching should be decided on a case-by-case basis with disclosure of potential consequences to the patient.

Abstract: Prescribers are warned to be vigilant for potential cytochrome P450 mediated drug interactions; guidelines separately highlight risks of toxicity associated with zuclopenthixol acuphase. We previously examined potential cytochrome P450 interactions with zuclopenthixol and here describe dangerous side effects in a patient receiving zuclopenthixol acuphase and the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine at high dose.
We present the case of a patient established on fluoxetine 80 mg/day who subsequently received injected zuclopenthixol acuphase 100 mg.
Following zuclopenthixol acuphase administration, dangerous extra-pyramidal side effects were observed, including severe laryngeal dystonia necessitating emergency medical treatment.
Our observations of symptoms of zuclopenthixol toxicity are consistent with a cytochrome P450 2D6/3A4 interaction with fluoxetine. Previous evidence demonstrating this interaction included only patients taking fluoxetine up to 60 mg/day. This case extends the evidence base. In patients taking high dose fluoxetine, we advise marked reductions in the prescribed dose of zuclopenthixol acuphase.

Abstract: To report the first case of amblyopia due to a conversion disorder in a child.
A 9-year-old girl without allergies or family or personal antecedents of interest presented to our clinic. She manifested a progressive visual loss after an episode of lumbar pain. This progressive loss led the patient in a 6-month period to legal bilateral blindness: visual acuity inferior to 2/20 in both eyes and severe constriction of both visual fields.
Several pathologic processes were discarded by means of multiple explorations and a general multidisciplinary analysis: physical pathology, simulating patient, schizophrenia, and the Briquet syndrome. Finally, she was diagnosed with a conversion somatoform disorder leading to a bilateral blindness. For 6 months, the patient was successfully treated with psychotherapy and a pharmacologic protocol. Total recovery was achieved with final visual acuity of 20/20 in both eyes and normal visual fields.
Conversion disorders should be considered as an additional etiology of visual loss in children. In these cases, the analysis and multidisciplinary treatment is crucial for a successful outcome.

Abstract: We report the case of a 24-year-old female patient who initially developed a neuroleptic malignant syndrome after haloperidol exposure and experienced 6 years later a serotonin syndrome after repeated fluoxetine exposure. The patient did not respond to symptomatic treatment and died in this latter episode. At necropsy, no gross or microscopic changes were seen with conventional histological stains, and immunohistochemical stains were negative. This is the first clinicopathologic case of a patient who experienced both neuroleptic malignant and serotonin syndromes. We speculate that this case argue in favor that both syndromes share some fundamental pathogenetic mechanisms.

Abstract: Sleep bruxism, the involuntary grinding and/or clenching of teeth during sleep, may occur in young children and may be secondary to medication use, especially selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). The mesocortical disinhibition produced by SSRIs may lead to dopamine depletion that manifests itself as nocturnal bruxism, a specific form of akathisia. This may be prevented by using buspirone, a 5-HT1A agonist that reduces serotonergic activity and increases dopaminergic activity. This article reports on a case history of an adolescent with fluoxetine-induced bruxism that was successfully treated with buspirone. As SSRI use is on the rise for treating childhood psychiatric disorders, this case report highlights the importance of recognizing SSRI-induced bruxism and the possible related adverse dental side effects. Furthermore, this report supports the efficacy of a treatment strategy in adolescents, which has previously been reported only for adult patients.

Abstract: Recent recommendations include screening for depression in adolescents when systems for diagnosis, treatment, and follow up are in place; conducting a risk assessment of factors such as parental depression, comorbid mental health or chronic medical conditions, and having had a major negative life event; and that intervention with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor drugs when adequate monitoring is available, psychotherapy, and combined treatment have been found to be effective (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, 2009). Kayla benefited from this model of early detection through the school nurse and early intervention and satisfactory monitoring of treatment and safety.

Abstract: A 42-year-old woman with a history of depression and epilepsy ingested two types of household detergent and developed gastrointestinal symptoms, and subsequently acute renal failure. Coingestants included nontoxic quantities of paracetamol and therapeutic doses of sodium valproate and fluoxetine. The patient developed acute renal failure, and also had fever and unilateral ear inflammation. The acute renal failure resolved four days later. Patients presenting with detergent poisoning are typically screened and treated for gastrointestinal and respiratory toxicity. We discuss the mechanism of development of acute renal failure in our patient, review the literature linking detergent poisoning and nephrotoxicity, and propose a direct relationship between detergent poisoning and acute renal failure.

Abstract: A 2.5-year-old 12.4-kg (27.3-lb) castrated male Scottish Terrier was evaluated because of episodes of hypertonia and kyphosis for which a presumptive diagnosis of so-called Scottie cramp had been made when the dog was a puppy.
Findings of general physical, orthopedic, and neurologic examinations were within reference limits. Pelvic limb hypertonicity and kyphosis without signs of pain were induced with minimal exercise; ambulation returned to normal after a period of rest.
Fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, was administered orally at a dosage of 1.2 mg/kg (0.55 mg/lb) once daily for 1 month. After this period of treatment, clinical signs of the disease were greatly reduced; the dosage of fluoxetine was changed to 0.8 mg/kg (0.36 mg/lb) twice daily, and response to treatment continued.
Administration of benzodiazepines, vitamin E, or phenothiazines has been recommended for treatment of episodes of hypertonicity, but often does not result in control of clinical signs. It has been suggested that the pathogenesis of this disease is related to deficiencies in concentration or function of serotonin in the CNS; thus, a logical choice for treatment is administration of a serotonin reuptake inhibitor. In the dog of this report, fluoxetine resulted in good control of clinical signs. The use of an effective medication (other than a controlled substance) that is administered once or twice daily, has minimal adverse effects on the patient's mental status, and is inexpensive may lead to better owner compliance and an improved quality of life for affected dogs.

Abstract: Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is a common psychiatric disorder which is easily recognized. However, sometimes patients of OCD present in such an atypical or bizarre way that their problem comes to notice as being a psychiatric disorder after multiple consultations in different specialties. We are reporting a case of a man who had first sought opinion in the Department of Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) for hearing impairment. He was then referred to a neurologist and a general physician for evaluation of neurological cause of his symptom. As no pathology related to ENT or neurology could be detected, he was referred to the Department of Psychiatry. The patient's chief complaints were difficulty in hearing and inability to understand at once. He could be diagnosed as a case of OCD after meticulous evaluation and studying his response to treatment. There was significant improvement in all the presenting symptoms over a period of 6 weeks on 60 mg of fluoxetine.

Abstract: Prader-Willi syndrome is an uncommon multisystem genetic disorder caused by defects of chromosome 15 (15qll-ql3), often due to deletions or uniparental disomy The syndrome is characterized by neonatal hypotonia, dysmorphic facial features, short stature, motor and mental disabilities, behavioral changes, hyperphagia, precocious obesity and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. We present a 17 year-old woman, with a previous genetic diagnosis of Prader-Willi syndrome and BMI of 74 Kg/m(2), that was admitted in anasarca, with marked cyanosis, dyspnea and oliguria. She presented high levels of blood urea, creatinine and aminotransferases, in addition to hyperkalemia and hyperuricemia. She had been in regular use of fluoxetine during the last six months, and evolved with severe high blood pressure and respiratory failure, which needed intensive care support. Moreover, sequels and clear signs of recent self-injuries were observed in her trunk, forearms and hands. The findings of morbid obesity, anasarca, self-injury, hyperuricemia and hypoxemia in Prader-Willi syndrome are emphasized.

Abstract: A 2-year-old DNA-sexed female Congo African grey parrot (Psittacus erithacus erithacus) was evaluated for self-trauma of the feathers and skin of the tail base for a duration of more than 1 year. All rectrices and tail coverts were missing, the skin of the tail base was thickened and ulcerated, and the uropygial gland was swollen. Results of a complete blood cell count revealed relative monocytosis and basophilia. Survey radiographs showed truncation and lysis of the caudal vertebrae and pygostyle. Results of biopsy and bacterial culture of the tail base lesions revealed an ulcerative bacterial dermatitis positive for staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) type IV (community-acquired) methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The bird was treated with oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, meloxicam, fluoxetine, topical lidocaine gel, and hydrotherapy. One month later, tail feather regrowth was evident; however, follow-up over 2 years found continued self-trauma to the rectrices in spite of repeated skin biopsies negative for MRSA or other bacteria. It is unknown if the MRSA cultured from this bird was commensal or acquired from either the environment or humans to which the bird was exposed.

Abstract: Since being introduced into clinical practice 20 years ago, fluoxetine, a serotonin-reuptake inhibitor, has remained one of the most popular antidepressants prescribed in the United States. Upon reviewing the literature, the highest reported postmortem central blood fluoxetine and norfluoxetine concentrations are 22 and 6.8 mg/L, respectively, and reported liver fluoxetine and norfluoxetine concentrations are 29-128 and 17 mg/kg, respectively. A 31-year-old female with convulsive activity was found at home by her husband. Emergency services was contacted, and responders found the patient unresponsive with agonal respirations, a pulse of 20 bpm, and no measurable blood pressure. Despite all resuscitative efforts, the patient expired. Postmortem analyses revealed concentrations of 33 mg/L fluoxetine and 12 mg/L norfluoxetine in central blood and 400 mg/kg fluoxetine and 460 mg/kg norfluoxetine in liver. Vitreous fluoxetine and norfluoxetine concentrations were 5.2 and 2.2 mg/L, respectively. Utilizing a sensitive and specific analytical procedure, we report the highest recorded central blood and liver fluoxetine and norfluoxetine concentrations.

Abstract: Urticarial vasculitis (UV) is a disease characterized clinically by urticarial skin lesions and histologically by leukocytoclastic vasculitis caused by immunocomplex accumulation in post-capillary venules. Cases induced by various drugs such as cimetidine, diltiazem, potassium iodide, fluoxetine, and non-steroid inflammatory drugs have been reported in the literature. A 48-year-old female who developed pruritus and rash on her body 3 months after starting glatiramer acetate (GA) treatment for multiple sclerosis was diagnosed with UV after clinical and histopathological examination. This report presents the first case in the literature of UV induced by GA.

Abstract: Banned amphetamine-based anorectics are illicitly imported into the United States (US), but little is known regarding the harm these diet pills pose to US residents. A 26-year-old woman using imported diet pills presented with a two-year history of intermittent chest pains, palpitations, headaches and insomnia. Urine toxicology screen detected amphetamines and benzodiazepines. Fenproporex and chlordiazepoxide were detected in her pills. Her symptoms resolved after she stopped using diet pills. A 38-year-old man using imported diet pills presented after his occupational urine screen was significantly positive for amphetamine. Fenproporex and fluoxetine were detected in his pills. These cases illustrate the potential harm from imported prescription diet pills that combine fenproporex with benzodiazepines, antidepressants, diuretics, laxatives and other substances. Increasing physicians' awareness of imported diet pill use may improve care of patients suffering from the pills' many adverse effects.

Abstract: Serotonin syndrome is usually reported by the use of a combination of drugs. This is a possible case of serotonin syndrome after using Fluoxetine.
This is a case report of serotonin syndrome in an adolescent patient during treatment of depression with the medications. Subsequently, he developed headache, hyperhydrosis (diaphoresis), flushing, shaking, nausea, and vomiting, slurred speech (scanning speech), anxiety, restlessness, agitation, confusion, hallucination, and insomnia. Serotonin syndrome is suggested as one of the most probable diagnosis.
Clinicians treating adolescents should be aware of the potential for serotonin syndrome.

Abstract: This article presents the case of a female newborn with irritability, increased tonus, jitteriness, and eating difficulties who was referred to our institution. Her mother had been taking fluoxetine (20 mg daily) during the second and third trimesters of her pregnancy. The infant's signs began on the first day after birth and persisted for 6 weeks. Extensive investigations excluded infective, genetic, and metabolic causes, and a provisional diagnosis of fluoxetine withdrawal was made. There have been few reports of neonatal complications following maternal fluoxetine hydrochloride treatment. According to these, signs occurred within a few days after birth and lasted up to 4 weeks. To our knowledge, our patient demonstrated the longest duration of signs reported to date. We recommend that physicians be aware of these complications in newborns after fetal exposure in utero to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. These neonates should be followed-up closely for adverse signs during the first days of life so that signs can be recognized and treated if necessary.

Abstract: Temozolomide (TMZ) is a cytotoxic agent of the imidazotetrazine class, chemically related to dacarbazine. Its use poses higher risks of lymphopenia and opportunistic infections. Prophylaxis for Pneumocystis jiroveci must be considered up to 12 months after treatment discontinuation. The due literature (MEDLINE) makes no mention of a possible connection between the use of TMZ and tuberculosis (TB). A female patient, aged 59, featuring glioblastoma multiforme and having undergone solely a brain biopsy, was submitted to TMZ along with radiotherapy. After the first TMZ maintenance cycle, the referred patient was admitted displaying a background of a 40-day afternoon fever and productive coughing. She was thus submitted to a bronchoscopy and LBA, which resulted BAAR 1+/4+. TMZ was then suspended, and rifampicin, isoniazid, and pyrazinamide introduced. Considerations on prophylaxis with isoniazide in cancer patients are long-lived and scarce. Some subgroups are likely to benefit from the prophylactic administration of isoniazide during TMZ treatment, such as those patients under high doses of corticoids, patients with past medical history of TB, the malnourished, patients from endemic regions, and patients with highly reactive tuberculinic tests. That, nevertheless, must not restrict the administration of TMZ, but, rather, stand for a warning about its possible toxicity, and thus mitigate complications.

Abstract: In this article, we report two cases of pustular psoriasis flaring up after fluoxetine administration. A 21-year-old male patient with localized pustular psoriasis became erythrodermic following commencement of fluoxetine. Even though the lesions were unresponsive to cyclosporine A (Cyc A) treatment, dramatic resolution was observed with discontinuation of fluoxetine. A 44-year-old female patient with pustular psoriasis who was on Cyc A and acitretin therapy was given fluoxetine for her psychiatric symptoms. In the following 5 days, her lesions flared. Owing to previous experience, fluoxetine was stopped. Her lesions improved dramatically in the following 3 days. Exacerbation of psoriasis with antidepressant therapy has been rarely described. An extensive review of the literature revealed four such cases, all of which were seen after the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI). A serotoninergic influence in the etiopathogenesis of psoriasis may be possible together with a pharmacogenetic difference in the drug metabolism of these patients. Considering the two patients we presented and the patients previously reported in the literature, aggravation of pustular psoriasis by SSRI should be borne in mind.

Abstract: Compulsive skin picking, 'acne excoriee', neurotic (psychogenic) excoriation, dermatotillomania, occurring in 2% dermatology patients mostly in women, is a result of excessive scratching, picking, gouging or squeezing of the skin using teeth, tweezers, nail files, pins and knives, etc. The lesions are usually found on face and also on upper limbs and upper back, areas patients can easily reach. They may occur in absence or in response to skin pathology or sensation of itching. A young female patient attended OPD with the complaints of multiple excoriated lesions over the face, arms and forearms. The diagnosis was psychogenic excoriation which is an uncommon psychodermatological condition. She was treated with fluoxetine and behaviour therapy. The patient recovered fully with above treatment at the end of 3 months. Psychogenic excoriation is an uncommon psychodermatological condition which responds well to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and behaviour therapy (habit reversal training).

Abstract: Serotonin-selective re-uptake inhibitors are prescribed widely because they are regarded as having less severe side-effects compared with tricyclics and monoamine oxidase inhibitors. With this popularity, increasing attention has been drawn to their adverse effects. Development of extrapyramidal symptoms has been reported in some patients while taking fluoxetine, a commonly used serotonin-selective re-uptake inhibitor. Here, we report a case of persistent dystonia, thought to be associated with short-term fluoxetine use, which required treatment with botulinum toxin type A.

Abstract: The increased acceptance of medication in psychoanalysis has occurred with too little consideration of possible complications. The potentially adverse psychological effects and disintegrative aspects of this important technical modification require further examination. While the use of phenomenologically defined diagnostic criteria provides valuable guidance to the clinician, the decision to include pharmacotherapy in a psychoanalysis must be understood also as a transference-countertransference enactment. The analyst's attitude toward pharmacotherapy is an essential element in some defensive and gratifying enactments, resistances that can interfere with psychoanalytic processes. Clinical material is presented illustrating narcissistic and perverse resistances that might be facilitated by analysts' attitudes toward pharmacotherapy, attitudes often tacitly communicated in decisions to use combined treatment.

Abstract: Many commonly prescribed prescription drugs such as dopaminergic therapies can cause temporary hair loss. Sertraline is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Its relative potency for dopamine reuptake inhibition is one of its differentiations with other selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors such as fluoxetine.
This is a report of a woman with a major depressive disorder who complained of diffuse scalp hair loss during treatment with sertraline. This case is unique because before taking sertraline and after the discontinuation of sertraline, the patient had taken fluoxetine. There was no report of hair loss during the fluoxetine therapy.
The different impacts of sertraline and fluoxetine on dopamine reuptake inhibition were identified as a possible reason for this side effect. Therefore, this rare side effect of sertraline should be noted and further studies may show that switching from one selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor to another may prevent hair loss.

Abstract: The current article describes the case of a 13-year-old boy with mixed diagnostic features suggestive of Eating Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (EDNOS) and obsessive-compulsive disorder.
A multimodal assessment approach was used to unravel the symptoms in this case. Initial presentation of the case had predominant features of EDNOS, however, obsessive-compulsive disorder features appeared to better explain disordered eating characteristics as the case progressed. In particular, the presence of intrusive images hindered his ability to consume food.
A variety of psychological approaches, including components of family and cognitive-behavioral strategies had a slight impact on symptoms. Medication seemed to have a more substantial effect.
This rather unique case, which contained features of EDNOS and obsessive compulsive disorder, illustrates the need for an ongoing multimodal assessment and interdisciplinary treatment approach.

Abstract: The antidepressant milnacipran is a double serotonin/noradrenalin reuptake inhibitor. The low reported incidence of intoxication indicates excellent tolerance in comparison with tricyclic and second generation antidepressants. We report a fatal intoxication associating milnacipran, at blood levels (femoral=21.5 mg/l, cardiac=20 mg/l) 40-fold higher than the usual treatment concentration, and six other molecules (fluoxetine, norfluoxetine, sertraline, cyamemazine, nordazepam and oxazepam) at therapeutic levels. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported fatal intoxication involving milnacipran.

Abstract: Hyperprolactinemia is a well-recognized side effect of antipsychotic treatment. Cabergoline, a dopamine agonist, has been introduced on the market to treat hyperprolactinemia, even secondary to antipsychotic use.
In this article, we described two schizophrenic patients who received cabergoline to treat their antipsychotic-induced hyperprolactinemia and developed a subsequent psychotic exacerbation. The first patient received amisulpride as antipsychotic medication, and the second one took risperidone and fluoxetine for her psychotic and depressive symptoms, respectively. Both patients improved significantly their psychotic symptoms in 1 week without changing their former antipsychotic regimens.
To the best of our knowledge, we found no previous report of cabergoline-induced psychotic exacerbation in schizophrenic patients who received antipsychotics. We brought up questions whether schizophrenic patients on amisulpride or with the addition of fluoxetine may have higher risk to experience psychotic worsening. We also highlighted the possible role of dose-dependent nature in cabergoline-induced psychotic exacerbation, suggesting that the single starting dose of 0.5 mg or higher might be unsafe in schizophrenic patients.
These cases suggest that cabergoline, like other dopaminergic agents, should be used with caution in psychotic patients and the dose should be as low as possible.

Abstract: Eating disorders are commonly associated with depressive symptoms. In an adolescent and binge eating population fluoxetine is commonly used to treat co-morbid depression associated with eating disorders. In some patients this may precipitate treatment emergent mania (TEM). Risk factors in the adolescent population include being older, female, having a longer duration of illness, more previous mood episodes, a higher prevalence of subclinical hypothyroidism, early-onset anxiety and recent exposure to a mood-elevating agent. Diagnosis and management of these co-morbid conditions is challenging due to the overlapping symptomatology and the adverse effects of both conditions complicating pharmacological management. This is illustrated with three cases in a Chinese female adolescent population that experienced TEM while on fluoxetine and responded to valproate.

Abstract: Serotonergic influences on sexual function are poorly understood. SSRI have been associated not only with impairment of sexual function but with restoration of sexual potency. We report a case of recurrent priapism that was treated with Fluoxetine and low dose Perphenazine. During 20 months of follow up, his priapism has been in remission but it recurred very dramatically twice after drugs were tapered off. This case report proves that sexual side effects of Fluoxetine and low dose of Perphenazine may be more variable than previously thought.

Abstract: Mirtazapine augmentation to a serotonin-reuptake inhibitor has been proposed to boost antidepressant effects and more likely to induce manic switch. Such a combined antidepressant therapy strategy should be used carefully if the patient's refractoriness is attributable to mixed depressive features. Mixed depression is more difficult to be treated by antidepressant monotherapy and related to higher risk of manic switch during treatment. We report a case with no previous history of bipolar disorder, whereas developed full-blown psychotic manic symptoms soon after switch from fluoxetine to mirtazapine. The patient's premorbid characters and clinical presentations suggested an implicit bipolarity that predisposed her to a manic switch. Her manic switch was likely to be triggered by a simulated combined effect because of complex drug interactions during shifting from fluoxetine to mirtazapine. For patients in mixed depressive states, mood stabilizers are preferable to antidepressants.

Abstract: Serotonin syndrome is a potentially life-threatening adverse drug reaction caused by excessive serotonergic agonism in central and peripheral nervous system serotonergic receptors (Boyer EW, Shannon M. The serotonin syndrome. N Engl J Med 2005;352:1112-1120). Symptoms are characterized by a triad of neuron-excitatory features, which include (a) neuromuscular hyperactivity -- tremor, clonus, myoclonus, hyperreflexia and, in advanced stages, pyramidal rigidity; (b) autonomic hyperactivity -- diaphoresis, fever, tachycardia and tachypnea; (c) altered mental status -- agitation, excitement and, in advanced stages, confusion (Gillman PK. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors, opioid analgesics and serotonin toxicity. Br J Anaesth 2005;95:434-441). It arises when pharmacological agents increase serotonin neurotransmission at postsynaptic 5-hydroxytryptamine 1A and 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A receptors through increased serotonin synthesis, decreased serotonin metabolism, increased serotonin release, inhibition of serotonin reuptake or direct agonism of the serotonin receptors (Houlihan D. Serotonin syndrome resulting from coadministration of tramodol, venlafaxine, and mirtazapine. Ann Pharmacother 2004;38:411-413). The etiology is often the result of therapeutic drug use, intentional overdosing of serotonergic agents or complex interactions between drugs that directly or indirectly modulate the serotonin system (Boyer EW, Shannon M. The serotonin syndrome. N Engl J Med 2005;352:1112-1120). Due to the increasing availability of agents with serotonergic activity, physicians need to more aware of serotonin syndrome. The following case highlights the complex nature in which serotonin syndrome can arise, as well as the proper recognition and treatment of a potentially life-threatening yet easily avoidable condition.

Abstract: Glutaric aciduria type II is a rare disorder affecting the metabolism of fatty acid oxidation and several mitochondrial dehydrogenase enzymes. Narcolepsy and cataplexy is a disorder affecting sleep cycles and rapid eye movement activity. There is little information on outcome or management for either disorder in pregnancy.
This is a case of a 16-year-old with glutaric aciduria type II and narcolepsy with cataplexy, treated with L-carnitine, riboflavin, fluoxetine, and modafinil during pregnancy. Intrapartum management included intravenous carnitine administration, and the patient underwent cesarean delivery at term without complication.
This inborn error of metabolism and sleep disorder can be effectively treated during pregnancy with nutritional supplementation and stimulants. Because of the risk of cataplexy during labor, cesarean delivery is recommended to minimize the patient's risk.

Abstract: Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a sensorimotor disorder characterized by distressing sensations deep inside the limbs, typically occurring at bedtime or rest. These paresthesias involve an irresistible urge to move the limb, which provides temporary relief but at the expense of sleep and quality of life. The pathophysiology of RLS has been related to dopaminergic pathway dysfunction, thereby aligning it closely with depression from both pathophysiologic and treatment perspectives. Certain antidepressant drugs, including the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), may induce or exacerbate RLS. We describe the case of a 34-year-old woman with no history of RLS who came to the emergency department with acute decompensated heart failure. After 7 days of hospitalization, she was waitlisted to receive a heart transplant. Her mood became depressed, and she requested a psychiatric consultation; escitalopram 10 mg at bedtime was started. Within 2 days of starting therapy, she developed very severe (determined by a score based on an RLS symptom rating scale) RLS symptoms, warranting the discontinuation of escitalopram. Within 2 days of stopping therapy, her RLS symptoms improved considerably (rated as mild). One week later, the patient was rechallenged with a lower dose of escitalopram, and her very severe RLS symptoms reappeared. Within 2 days of stopping escitalopram, her RLS symptoms again improved, with complete resolution 1 week later. Using the Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale, which assesses the probability of a drug causing an adverse event, the patient's score was 9, indicating a definite adverse drug reaction. Although published case reports have linked fluoxetine, sertraline, citalopram, paroxetine, and mirtazapine to RLS, this is the first report, to our knowledge, of escitalopram as a cause of RLS. Based on this case and additional data published with other SSRIs and SNRIs, we believe that escitalopram should be added to the list of agents that can induce RLS.

Abstract: Phymas (swellings, masses, or bulbs) are considered the end-stage of rosacea and mostly affect the nose (rhinophyma), and rarely involve the chin (gnatophyma), the cheek (metophyma), eyelids (blepharophyma), or ears (otophyma). Herein, we report the case of a 57-year-old man who developed unilateral enlargement of his left ear over 2 years. Biopsy revealed changes of rosaceous lymphedema associated with Demodex infestation. Corticosteroid and minocycline therapies resulted in partial reduction of the ear enlargement. Literature review examining for cases of lymphedema (elephantiasis) of the ear revealed that chronic inflammatory disorders (rosacea (most frequent), psoriasis, eczema), bacterial cellulitis (erysipelas), pediculosis, trauma, and primary (congenital) lymphedema can all lead to localized, lymphedematous enlargement of the ear. Depending on the severity, medical treatment directed at the inflammatory condition for mild, diffuse enlargement to surgical debulking for extensive diffuse enlargement or tumor formation can improve the signs and symptoms of otophyma. Decreased immune surveillance secondary to rosaceous lymphedema may explain why Demodex infestation is common in rosacea and support the suspicion that phymatous skin is predisposed to skin cancer development.

Abstract: Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) is a distinct clinical entity within a spectrum of adverse cutaneous drug reactions. It is characterized by >30% of the body surface area of skin detachment with an average reported mortality of 25-35%. Drug induced TEN is associated with various antibiotics, anticonvulsants and other drugs. While adverse cutaneous drug reactions are common with antidepressants, the majority eruptions are benign and easily treated. TEN is rarely reported in association with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI's). We describe TEN in a 34-year-old patient from Mozambique associated with the addition of fluoxetine for a major depressive episode with psychotic features.

Abstract: Skeletal fluorosis (SF) can result from prolonged consumption of well water with >4 ppm fluoride ion (F(-); i.e., >4 mg/liter). Black and green teas can contain significant amounts of F(-). In 2005, SF caused by drinking 1-2 gallons of double-strength instant tea daily throughout adult life was reported in a 52-yr-old woman.
A 49-yr-old woman developed widespread musculoskeletal pains, considered fibromyalgia, in her mid-30s. Additionally, she had unexplained, increasing, axial osteosclerosis. She reported drinking 2 gallons of instant tea each day since 12 yr of age. Fluoxetine had been taken intermittently for 5 yr. Ion-selective electrode methodology quantitated F(-) in her blood, urine, fingernail and toenail clippings, tap water, and beverage.
Radiographs showed marked uniform osteosclerosis involving the axial skeleton without calcification of the paraspinal, intraspinal, sacrotuberous, or iliolumbar ligaments. Minimal bone excrescences affected ligamentous attachments in her forearms and tibias. DXA Z-scores were +10.3 in the lumbar spine and +2.8 in the total hip. Her serum F(-) level was 120 microg/liter (reference range, 20-80 microg/liter), and a 24-h urine collection contained 18 mg F(-)/g creatinine (reference value, <3). Fingernail and toenail clippings showed 3.50 and 5.58 mg F(-)/kg (control means, 1.61 and 2.02, respectively; p(s) < 0.001). The instant tea beverage, prepared as usual extra strength using tap water with approximately 1.2 ppm F(-), contained 5.8 ppm F(-). Therefore, the tea powder contributed approximately 35 mg of the 44 mg daily F(-) exposure from her beverage. Fluoxetine provided at most 3.3 mg of F(-) daily.
SF from habitual consumption of large volumes of extra strength instant tea calls for recognition and better understanding of a skeletal safety limit for this modern preparation of the world's most popular beverage.

Abstract: Sexual dysfunctions such as low libido, anorgasmia, genital anesthesia, and erectile dysfunction are very common in patients taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). It has been assumed that these side effects always resolve after discontinuing treatment, but recently, four cases were presented in which sexual function did not return to baseline. Here, we describe three more cases. Case #1: A 29-year-old with apparently permanent erectile dysfunction after taking fluoxetine 20 mg once daily for a 4-month period in 1996. Case #2: A 44-year-old male with persistent loss of libido, genital anesthesia, ejaculatory anhedonia, and erectile dysfunction after taking 20-mg once daily citalopram for 18 months. Case #3: A 28-year-old male with persistent loss of libido, genital anesthesia, and ejaculatory anhedonia since taking several different SSRIs over a 2-year period from 2003-2005.
No psychological issues related to sexuality were found in any of the three cases, and all common causes of sexual dysfunction such as decreased testosterone, increased prolactin or diabetes were ruled out. Erectile capacity is temporarily restored for Case #1 with injectable alprostadil, and for Case #2 with oral sildenafil, but their other symptoms remain. Case #3 has had some reversal of symptoms with extended-release methylphenidate, although it is not yet known if these prosexual effects will persist when the drug is discontinued.
SSRIs can cause long-term effects on all aspects of the sexual response cycle that may persist after they are discontinued. Mechanistic hypotheses including persistent endocrine and epigenetic gene expression alterations were briefly discussed.

Abstract: We present a case of medication-induced akathisia in a 47-year-old woman with metastatic carcinoma of the ovary. Severe pacing and restlessness started after commencing a subcutaneous infusion with cyclizine 150 mg, haloperidol 2.5 mg and oxycodone 20 mg. She was also taking levomepromazine and fluoxetine orally at the time. By making changes to her medication, her symptoms resolved gradually. During the time of convalescence, she gained great symptomatic relief from using exercise pedals and it allowed her to go about usual everyday activities, such as eating and reading, while continuously treading the pedals.

Abstract: Wilson's disease (WD) is a genetic neurodegenerative disorder; it exhibits wide heterogeneity in symptoms and usually presents with liver disease and/ or neuropsychiatric manifestations. The common neurological manifestations observed are dysarthria, gait disturbance, dystonia, rigidity, tremor, dysphagia and chorea. The frequent psychiatric manifestations reported are personality and mood changes, depression, phobias, cognitive impairment, psychosis, anxiety, compulsive and impulsive behavior. Isolated obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a rare presentation of WD. Reported herein is a case of a 17-year-old boy with isolated OCD. He presented to the psychiatrist with symptoms of contamination obsessions and washing compulsions, along with compulsion of repeated feet tapping and was treated with adequate doses of fluoxetine for 6 months but did not improve. Later on, he was diagnosed as a case of WD and showed improvement with chelating and behavior therapy. This implies the importance of the occurrence of isolated psychological symptoms in WD.

Abstract: Osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS) may be precipitated by aggressive correction of a hypo or hyper-osmolar states. We describe the case of a 53-year-old woman that was started on fluoxetine 20 mg/day for depression and nine days later was found to have fluoxetine-induced syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone. After hyponatremia correction the mental status of the patient gradually improved, but subsequently she had intermittent difficulty in speaking, naming objects, memory deficits and psychomotor slowness. Magnetic resonance revealed bilateral symmetric hyperintense lesions in the basal ganglia, temporal lobe and hippocampal formation compatible with ODS. These symptoms gradually resolved and she was discharged home without any deficits. Two months later, a new image showed lesion in pons and the other lesions had disappeared. Fluoxetine therapy had never been related with a complication like that.

Abstract: Sudden discontinuation of serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRI) can lead to a number of psychological (e.g., nervousness, anxiety, crying spells, psychomotor agitation, irritability, depersonalization, decreased mood, memory disturbances, confusion, decreased concentration, and/or slowed thinking) and somatic (e.g., nausea, dizziness, headache) symptoms. Recent studies have shown that withdrawal symptoms are common with paroxetine, venlafaxine and fluvoxamine, but relatively rare and mild with fluoxetine cessation, likely as a result of its longer half-life. We report an unusual case of a patient who developed delirium after abrupt discontinuation of fluoxetine.

Abstract: Bulimia nervosa (BN) and related eating disorders such as binge eating disorder are common. General practitioners can play a key role in the identification and management of BN and related eating disorders.
This article describes the presenting and associated features of BN and overviews evidence based treatment approaches.
Key features are recurrent episodes of binge eating, extreme weight control behaviours and over concern about weight and shape issues. By definition people are not underweight. Risk factors include being from a western culture, obesity, exposure to a restrictive dieting environment and low self esteem. People are more likely to present asking for help in weight control or a physical problem secondary to the eating disorder. Evidenced based therapies with good outcomes in current use are cognitive behaviour therapy (in full or guided self help forms), high dose fluoxetine, and interpersonal psychotherapy. It is important to convey optimism about treatment efficacy and outcomes.

Abstract: We describe the first four cases of an open-label study investigating the response to citalopram in a depressed pediatric oncology population. Advice from the Committee for Safety of Medicines (CSM) in the United Kingdom warning against the use of serotonin-selective reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants other than fluoxetine in this age group led to the discontinuation of the study. Advantages of citalopram over fluoxetine in a medical setting are discussed in terms of its favorable drug-interaction profile and shorter half-life. Citalopram was very well tolerated in these patients and preliminary data are presented that support its efficacy as an antidepressant agent in these patients.

Abstract: A case of acute myocarditis associated with the commencement of clozapine is described, highlighting the onset, course and possible contributing factors. There is an urgent need to raise awareness about this potentially fatal complication of clozapine use.
A 20-year-old male with schizophrenia developed a sudden onset of myocarditis after commencement of clozapine. The patient recovered with intensive medical support. The symptoms occurred around 2 weeks after starting clozapine in an inpatient setting. Possible contributing factors may have been concomitant antidepressant use and unaccustomed physical activity.
Myocarditis is an increasingly recognized complication associated with the use of clozapine. It can be fatal if not recognized and treated early. Considering that clozapine remains the gold standard in treatment of resistant psychosis, there is an urgent need to raise awareness among medical and paramedical staff involved in the care of these patients. There are also implications for recommendations and regulations regarding the use of clozapine.

Abstract: A severe cyclic constellation of affective symptoms during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle is termed premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD).
A 17-yr-old female was referred for evaluation of behavior changes with her menses. Parents noted behavior changes, two to three days before the onset and lasting till the end of her menses. Menarche was at 13 years. Periods were regular, with normal flow and duration and no dysmenorrhea. Psychosocial history was unremarkable. There was no history of sexual activity or abuse. Her physical exam was unremarkable. With the working diagnosis of premenstrual dysphoric syndrome she was asked to keep track of her menses on a menstrual calendar and her symptoms with a daily diary. She was treated with Fluoxetine 20 mg/day during the luteal phase of her menstrual cycle with complete resolution of her symptoms.
In PMDD the mood disturbance occurs during the late luteal phase of the menstrual cycle (approximately 1 week before the onset of menstrual bleeding), remits after the onset of menses, and can be established by a prospective daily symptom log for two consecutive cycles. The symptoms are more severe than that of premenstrual syndrome, are associated with significant functional impairment and are cyclical. Symptoms were documented prospectively as starting a few days before her menstrual bleeding and remitting at the end of it. She responded to episodic use of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. This disorder needs to be better recognized, because it can be easily treated.

Abstract: Feeding disorders of infancy or early childhood are relatively uncommon in the pediatric population. In posttraumatic eating disorder, the infant demonstrates food refusal after a traumatic event or repeated traumatic events to the oropharynx or esophagus. We present case reports of 24-month-old twin girls, A and B, who presented to our clinic with food refusal and fear of feeding. Several invasive gastrointestinal procedures were performed when they were 3 months old, and they started to refuse all solid food and some liquids soon after hospitalization. Fluoxetine 0.3 mg/kg per day (5 mg/day) was started to target their anxiety and fear about feeding. In the second month of weekly follow up, the children began to be fed without a nasogastric catheter. A significant decrease in anxiety and fear was observed during feeding. Although the use of serotonin-selective reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in preschool children is controversial due to the lack of empirical data in this age group, we observed clinical improvements in anxiety in these two cases. Furthermore, fluoxetine was well tolerated and no side effects were observed.

Abstract: Sexual adverse effects are common with psychotropics. Rational polypharmacy may confound etiology. This case report describes development of ejaculatory inhibition in a male patient with co-morbid psychiatric diagnoses treated with fluoxetine, divalproex sodium, lamotrigine, trazodone, and clonazepam. Detailed psychotropic history with time-line of adverse effect onset implicated trazodone. Within 48 hours of trazodone discontinuation, ejaculatory inhibition was resolved. Clinicians should be aware that trazodone may cause ejaculatory inhibition, understand that determination of sexual adverse effects necessitates directed and periodic questioning as these symptoms may increase in severity over time, and appreciate that religious patients may find discussing this issue difficult.

Abstract: We report a case of a 28-year-old major depressive female patient who manifested ecchymoses following fluoxetine use. After substitution of sertraline, her depression resolved after 4 weeks and ecchymoses 1.5 months latter. This is an unexplored side-effect with unknown long-term consequences that warrants further study.

Abstract: We report on three patients with hepatitis C virus infection, severe mental illness, and substance use disorders that we treated successfully with interferon and ribavirin. This population has historically been refused such treatment on the grounds that they were unlikely to be adherent to treatment or would experience untoward psychiatric side effects. These case reports add support to the growing body of evidence that persons with severe mental illness and substance use disorders can be successfully treated for hepatitis C with careful monitoring and psychiatric oversight.

Abstract: Paroxetine (Paxil) is a widely prescribed antidepressant of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) class for which multiple cutaneous adverse effects have been reported, including urticaria, ecchymoses, vasculitis, and pruritus. In contrast, fluoxetine (Prozac) is the only SSRI previously reported to cause urticarial vasculitis. Urticarial vasculitis is a chronic disorder marked by recurrent episodes of erythematous, indurated wheals that histologically manifest the features of leukocytoclastic vasculitis. This case represents the first reported incidence of paroxetine-induced urticarial vasculitis, and highlights the need to consider the entire SSRI class as s as a potential cause of the condition.

Abstract: This article reviews the pathophysiology of vasomotor symptoms (VMS) of menopause and current management options.
Current scientific literature.
In most menopausal women, loss of ovarian function results in VMS, including hot flashes, night sweats, and mood and sleep disturbances. Hormone therapy (HT) has been the mainstay of VMS treatment for many years, but safety concerns raised by publication of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) results have dramatically reduced the use of this treatment. Since the WHI published its findings, attention has focused on other novel treatments for menopausal symptoms, including low-dose oral or transdermal HT and agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, gabapentin, and clonidine. Many women also use complementary and alternative medications to manage VMS, but little evidence from controlled clinical trials supports their efficacy.
The increasing number of alternative treatments for VMS requires improvement in patient-provider communication about treatment risks and benefits, individualization of treatment to meet patient needs and attitudes, and careful follow-up to ensure adherence to potentially effective therapy. Nurse practitioners play a leading role in patient evaluation, discussions, and management to help women achieve control over bothersome VMS that dramatically impact their quality of life.

Abstract: Clozapine is not a drug that is ever used casually. Patients generally are afflicted with severe illnesses and have demonstrated treatment resistance and/or intolerance to other therapeutic options before clozapine is seriously considered. When the clinical stakes are this high, it is especially important that physicians gain an appreciation for the various drug-drug interactions that can significantly increase or decrease clozapine blood levels; such pharmacokinetic changes can derail clozapine treatment by producing clozapine toxicity or loss of antipsychotic efficacy, respectively. The authors present a case series of five drug-drug interactions involving clozapine, each of which illustrates different mechanisms by which the metabolism of clozapine can be altered. Exploring these cases should help clinicians anticipate and avoid these undesirable drug-drug interactions.

Abstract: Reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD) is an unusual diagnosis in the pediatric age group. It is a syndrome characterized by pain in one or more extremities with a significant morbidity in childhood. Patients with RSD have frequently undergone many unnecessary investigations such that the diagnosis and treatment may be considerably delayed. The pathophysiology remains unclear; however, a number of psychological problems were frequently suggested to play a role in this disorder. We describe a 13-year-old girl diagnosed as pediatric RSD who was admitted to a child and adolescent psychiatry unit with a history of severe pain in the right hand, increasing disability and symptoms of nervousness and withdrawal from social activities. In this report, we discuss psychogenic factors underlying the disorder of an adolescent girl and psychiatric approach as a part of a multimodal treatment of pediatric RSD.

Abstract: Stuttering is a disturbance in the normal fluency and time patterning of speech. Developmental stuttering (DS), with or without associated psychiatric illness, is the most common form and includes all cases with gradual onset in childhood that are not the result of acquired brain damage. Persistent developmental stuttering (PDS) is DS that has not undergone spontaneous or speech therapy-induced remission. Adults in speech therapy behavioral programs will often show regression and even total relapse if they stop practicing. This case report deals with a patient of PDS who responded significantly to treatment with fluoxetine.

Abstract: Tianeptine, an atypical tricyclic antidepressant, is one of the first chemical agents, like tricyclic antidepressants and selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which are employed for the treatment of anxiety and depressive disorders. It is believed that tianeptine, unlike the SSRIs, is enhancing serotonin re-uptake the velocity of the cortical neurons in the lymbic system and hippocampal neurons. In literature, there are more examples of dependence cases of antidepressants, which have amphetaminergic effects, such as amineptine and tranylcipromine, than amitriptyline, fluoxetine and tianeptine. Contrary to the reports about using high dosages of tianeptine, case reports about misuse and dependence have revealed that the most common reason of dependence is the psychostimulant effect. In these cases, tolerance to tianeptine and the symptoms of depreviation in absence of the drug have been seen, and the history of dependence or abuse of any drug or alcohol, treatment for mood and/or personality disorders are mentioned as possible risks for the dependence to tianeptine. This report discusses the diagnosis and treatment of a tianeptine dependence case. The 34 year-old patient, who is in conflict with her own family members, does not have the history of dependence or abuse of any substances, except for smoking, had been using excessive doses of 750 mg/day of tianeptine for a year.

Abstract: A case of serotonin syndrome that developed during concurrent linezolid and fluoxetine is presented.
A 23-year-old white male patient was originally admitted to receive intravenous chemotherapy for acute myelogenous leukemia. He had a history of intravenous amphetamine abuse, hepatitis B virus infection, hepatitis C virus infection, depression, and bipolar disorder. The patient's routine medications before admission included methadone, fluoxetine, voriconazole, transdermal nicotine patch, lorazepam, and quetiapine. The patient developed persistent neutropenia and complications from chemotherapy, including mild mucositis. Despite treatment with levofloxacin, acyclovir, and voriconazole, the patient developed high fevers. Levofloxacin was discontinued and aztreonam and vancomycin were started. After a blood culture revealed that the bacteria were likely vancomycin resistant, vancomycin was discontinued and linezolid was initiated. Nine hours later, the patient began complaining of severe pain in his abdomen. After a total of four doses of linezolid, the patient reported further discomfort. Two days after linezolid initiation, a health care team member identified the interaction between fluoxetine and linezolid as the cause of the patient's symptoms, and linezolid was discontinued. All symptoms resolved within 48 hours. While resolution generally occurs within 24-48 hours after discontinuing the offending agent, the time to resolution may be delayed if the agent has a long half-life or active metabolites, in which case admission to an intensive care unit is recommended. Cyproheptadine and chlorpromazine may also be used to treat symptoms.
Serotonin syndrome developed in a patient taking concurrent linezolid and fluoxetine.

Abstract: A patient was seen on the palliative care service at our institution who developed serotonin syndrome and mutism associated with methadone use. Serotonin syndrome is often described as a clinical triad of mental status changes, autonomic hyperactivity, and neuromuscular abnormalities, but not all of these findings are consistently present in all patients with the disorder. The incidence of the serotonin syndrome is thought to mirror the increasing number of proserotonergic agents being used in clinical practice. In 2002, the Toxic Exposure Surveillance System, which receives case descriptions from office-based practices, inpatient settings, and emergency departments, reported 26,733 incidences of exposure to selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) that caused significant toxic effects in 7349 persons and resulted in 93 deaths. Serotonin syndrome is not an idiopathic drug reaction; it is a predictable consequence of excess serotonergic agonism of central nervous system (CNS) receptors and peripheral serotonergic receptors. The myriad of symptoms with which serotonin syndrome may present is compounded by the fact that more than 85% of physicians are unaware of serotonin syndrome as a clinical diagnosis. Other SSRIs such as fluoxetine and fluvoxamine have been shown to increase methadone plasma concentrations in dependent patients. Although the exact mechanism is unknown, there are several pathways via which a significant interaction could occur. This would include the effects methadone has on N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) in addition to the impact of methadone on the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. The mainstay of treatment of serotonin syndrome is withdrawal of the offending agent and supportive care. These actions resulted in resolution of our patient's symptoms. Serotonin syndrome is becoming more common, and with the utilization of polypharmacy on many palliative care services should be considered as unifying differential diagnosis in the appropriate setting.

Abstract: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are commonly prescribed to women with depression and anxiety disorders. Although night sweats are a reported adverse effect, some women have relief of vasomotor symptoms during perimenopausal period while taking them. The relationships between SSRIs, thermoregulation, gonadotropins, and estrogen and their connection to fertility remain unclear.
A reproductive-aged woman, seeking treatment for infertility, experienced night sweats and elevated follicle-stimulating hormone levels while taking SSRIs for treatment of depression.
Many women of reproductive age are taking SSRIs, but the affect of SSRIs on normal reproductive function is unknown and further research in this area is needed.

Abstract: Fluoxetine (Prozac) is a widely prescribed drug in adults and children, and it has an active metabolite, norfluoxetine, with a prolonged elimination time. Although uncommon, Prozac causes QT interval prolongation and arrhythmias; a patient who took an overdose of Prozac exhibited a prolonged QT interval (QTc 625 msec). We looked for possible mechanisms underlying this clinical finding by analysing the effects of fluoxetine and norfluoxetine on ion channels in vitro.
We studied the effects of fluoxetine and norfluoxetine on the electrophysiology and cellular trafficking of hERG K+ and SCN5A Na+ channels heterologously expressed in HEK293 cells.
Voltage clamp analyses employing square pulse or ventricular action potential waveform protocols showed that fluoxetine and norfluoxetine caused direct, concentration-dependent, block of hERG current (IhERG). Biochemical studies showed that both compounds also caused concentration-dependent reductions in the trafficking of hERG channel protein into the cell surface membrane. Fluoxetine had no effect on SCN5A channel or HEK293 cell endogenous current. Mutations in the hERG channel drug binding domain reduced fluoxetine block of IhERG but did not alter fluoxetine's effect on hERG channel protein trafficking.
Our findings show that both fluoxetine and norfluoxetine at similar concentrations selectively reduce IhERG by two mechanisms, (1) direct channel block, and (2) indirectly by disrupting channel protein trafficking. These two effects are not mediated by a single drug binding site. Our findings add complexity to understanding the mechanisms that cause drug-induced long QT syndrome.

Abstract: The use of atypical antipsychotics in schizophrenic patients has been associated with a risk of weight gain. Similarly, recovery from depression is often followed by improved appetite, greater food intake and potential increase in weight.
A Caucasian 33-year-old schizophrenic female patient was being treated with 6 mg/day of risperidone and 15 mg/day of clorazepate. She developed depressive symptomatology and 40 mg/day of fluoxetine was gradually added to her treatment regimen for about 9 months. After the remission of depression, and the discontinuation of fluoxetine, she experienced an increase in appetite and subsequently excessive weight gain of 52 kg. Re-administration of fluoxetine did not reverse the situation. The patient developed diabetes mellitus, which was successfully controlled with metformin 1700 mg/day. The addition at first of orlistat 360 mg/day and later of topiramate 200 mg/day has helped her to lose a significant part of the weight gained (30 kg).
The case suggests a probable association between the remission of depressive symptomatology and weight gain in a schizophrenic patient.

Abstract: A 14-year-old girl with anorexia nervosa (AN) was found to have an intracranial neoplasm. Atypical psychological symptoms prompted further evaluation, including electroencephalogram and neuroimaging, which revealed a sellar and suprasellar mass. This patient had an eating disorder and a brain tumor, which appear to be two unrelated conditions. However, it remains unclear how each affected the other. The diagnosis of AN, like all other psychiatric disorders, requires that possible medical etiologies and coexisting medical problems be excluded. AN and other eating disorders are particularly difficult to diagnose in children and adolescents because they often do not present in the manner typical of adults. Perceptual and cognitive disturbances associated with AN are difficult to evaluate because children and adolescents normally change over time as they progress through different stages of development. Therefore, it is particularly important to evaluate for the presence of medical conditions when a diagnosis of an eating disorder is made in a child or adolescent.

Abstract: Drugs may be an important cause of atypical lymphocytic infiltration. Oftentimes, these infiltrates are in the context of pseudolymphomata. We report a patient who developed lymphocytoma cutis temporally associated with initiation of fluoxetine therapy that later went on to develop cutaneous marginal zone B-cell lymphoma. The response of peripheral blood lymphocytes to fluoxetine and other drugs was examined in an attempt to ascertain the potential role for drugs in the propagation of these infiltrates.
Routine light microscopic analysis and phenotypic studies were performed on tissue obtained from a skin biopsy. Lymphocyte mitogenic studies were carried out using increasing concentrations of fluoxetine, bupropion, and two anticonvulsants.
An initial biopsy was consistent with lymphocytoma cutis. The patient stopped fluoxetine associated with lesional regression. The lesions recurred despite being off fluoxetine; a repeat biopsy was compatible with marginal zone lymphoma. Lymphocyte proliferation assays revealed a suppressive effect on T-lymphocyte proliferation at physiologic concentrations. Other tested drugs did not have a similar suppressive effect.
Fluoxetine may be associated with pseudolymphomata and marginal zone lymphoma. The inhibitory effects on T-lymphocyte function and more specifically T-suppressor function may lead to excessive antigen-driven B-cell proliferation.

Abstract: Developmental stuttering and tics share many clinical and therapeutical aspects. Dopaminergic neurotransmission seems to be involved in the pathophysiology of both, tics and stuttering. We report on a patient with severe stuttering and mild facial tics which were dramatically improved by cocaine, challenging previous reports.

Abstract: Pimozide is an antidopaminergic, antipsychotic drug. Exposure during human pregnancy has not been reported previously, and recommendations on its use are based on extrapolation from other antipsychotics with antidopaminergic activity.
A 26-year-old woman had Gilles de la Tourette syndrome and obsessive-compulsive disorder. It was not possible to discontinue pimozide during pregnancy, although the dosage was reduced to 1 mg daily. In addition, she was treated with 20 mg fluoxetine until gestational week 27. By request of the patient, elective cesarean section was scheduled for week 38. As a precaution, pimozide was withdrawn 2 weeks prior to the section. During this period the patient's symptoms severely intensified, and an emergency cesarean section had to be performed at 36 weeks. A healthy male infant weighing 2,448 g was delivered. Pediatric examination of the infant and electroencephalogram demonstrated no neurologic abnormalities. On day 4 both mother and infant were discharged.
This is the first published report on fetal exposure to pimozide.

Abstract: Sexual side-effects, in general, are common with selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Genital anaesthesia is a rare side-effect previously described with sertraline and fluoxetine use. With SSRI discontinuation, the sexual side-effects are expected to resolve. We report a case of a 26-year-old male who experienced genital anaesthesia during sertraline treatment and continued to be symptomatic despite medication discontinuation 6 years previously. To date, there have been no published reports of SSRI-induced sexual side-effects persisting beyond SSRI discontinuation. This case highlights the complex interplay of psychopharmacologic and psychodynamic factors that can occur in patients with sexual dysfunction.

Abstract: The patient with acute extrapyramidal signs and symptoms presents a significant clinical challenge. We present the case of a young man who developed an acute akathisia and dystonia after inadvertent overdose of olanzapine (Zyprexa) in the setting of a recent discontinuation of fluoxetine. The receptor chemistry and mechanisms pertinent to his presentation are reviewed. An analysis of the literature indicates that a broad incidence range is cited for the extrapyramidal effects of these medications. We suggest a diagnostic and therapeutic approach to the undifferentiated patient presenting with extrapyramidal signs and symptoms. The possibility of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), serotonin syndrome (SS), tricyclic overdose, and cocaine abuse should be considered in a patient with extrapyramidal signs and symptoms, given the potential for complications. An emphasis is placed on the need for carefully verbalized discharge instructions to avoid a potential untoward outcome.

Abstract: We present a patient with a de novo 12q nonmosaic pure duplication characterized by multiple minor anomalies and Dandy-Walker malformation. A neurological and behavioral assessment revealed psychomotor retardation and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), with neurobehavioral abnormalities (auto- and heteroaggressive behavior). Fluoxetine therapy in this case markedly improved the neurobehavioral profile, with a decreased level of aggression. To define the extension of the duplicated region, we performed FISH analyses by using YAC probes. The analyses revealed a tandem duplication of the 12q22q24.33 region, with the proximal breakpoint located between 96.5 and 97.6 cM and the distal one between 154 and 161 cM. This is the first case of pure de novo duplication involving the 12q22q24.33 region. To better define the clinical phenotype associated with 12q partial duplication, we compared our case with the four patients with similar pure duplications previously described.

Abstract: Hyponatremia is a significant complication of treatment with serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors (SSRI). We describe a case of a 53-year-old woman that was started on fluoxetine 20 mg/day for depression. Nine days later, the patient started with weakness, nausea, progressing to confusion, inappetence and vomit. Three hours later she became unresponsive and had a generalized seizure. She was brought to our emergency service. On admission, the patient was normovolemic, without focal motor deficits, but had mild generalized muscle rigidity and Babinski's sign bilaterally. Serum sodium was 105 mmol/L, serum osmolality, 220 mmol/L, and urinary osmolality, 400 mmol/L. The other laboratory exams, chest X-ray, cerebrospinal fluid and cranium tomography were normal. She was found to have fluoxetine-induced SIADH and it was discontinued. We started the hyponatremia correction and, in 5 days, the mental status of the patient gradually returned to a normal baseline, paralleling the resolution of her hyponatremia, without recurrence. Hyponatremia and SIADH should be considered if a patient experiences deterioration in his or her clinical condition while taking SSRI. The use of SSRI antidepressants should be remembered in the differential diagnosis of drug-induced hyponatremia.

Abstract: We report on a 15-year-old patient who was diagnosed with congenital myasthenic syndrome (CMS) at the age of 7 months. At initial diagnosis, the CMS was not further characterized. The patient was treated for several years with the anticholinesterase drug (Mestinon), without clinical benefit. The patient deteriorated progressively and became dependent on home nocturnal ventilatory support, being unable to take part in daily life activities at age of 12 years. At age 14, the slow-channel syndrome mutation CHRNE L269F (805C>T) was detected and acetylcholinesterase inhibitor therapy was immediately stopped. Fluoxetine therapy was started and gradually increased over 2 months. The boy improved dramatically in strength and endurance and was taken off ventilatory support 1 month after the fluoxetine therapy was initiated. The clinical improvement was confirmed by functional respiratory and electrophysiological tests.

Abstract: We present the case of an 18-year-old man, who was admitted with an obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) since 17 years old. He had symmetry and contamination obsessions and cleaning compulsions, and had been treated with fluoxetine 40 mg/day for 2 months. The patient was not taking additional psychotropic medication. We made ziprasidone augmentation to the treatment. First day, ziprasidone 40 mg bid was applied. Four hours after the evening dose, the patient complained about distress. He demonstrated a notable torticollis and dystonic posture to his left side. Intramuscular biperiden lactate (5 mg) was given, and dystonic symptoms resolved within 30 min. Ziprasidone is a new atypical antipsychotic with reported low potential for extrapyramidal side effects. To our knowledge, acute dystonic reaction with initial doses of ziprasidone in adult has not been reported yet. This case report describes a male patient with OCD developed acute dystonia shortly after initial doses (80 mg/day) of ziprasidone and discusses precautions in antipsychotic use.

Abstract: A 47-year-old woman developed confusion, incoordination, and hypertension after she was given linezolid in addition to sertraline for 5 days. Her symptoms resolved within 4 days of discontinuing linezolid. One and a half months later, she received a second course of linezolid; sertraline was discontinued on day 1 of linezolid therapy. On day 9 of therapy, the patient developed confusion, myoclonus, and incoordination, and cardiopulmonary arrest occurred, leaving the patient in a coma. Diarrhea, hypertension, and tachycardia developed after cardiopulmonary arrest. Linezolid was discontinued on day 10, and cyproheptadine was given. Linezolid is a weak monoamine oxidase inhibitor and has been reported to interact with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Several cases of serotonin syndrome in patients taking linezolid and SSRIs have been reported, including two reports with sertraline, one with paroxetine, four with citalopram, and two with fluoxetine. One abstract of a retrospective analysis reported that serotonin syndrome did not occur in patients who received linezolid and fluoxetine, paroxetine, or sertraline. Because of several limitations, however, no conclusions can be drawn from that retrospective analysis. A drug interaction involving escitalopram and linezolid has not been documented. Caution should be used when linezolid is used in patients receiving an SSRI. Other antibiotic options should be considered first, and linezolid should be reserved as the last resort if possible. If the infection requires linezolid, the SSRI should be discontinued, and the patient should be monitored closely for serotonin syndrome.

Abstract: Case report.
To describe a case of severe hypotension and occasional syncope following intermittent catheterisations in a tetraplegic patient.
Department of Spinal Injuries, Berck, France.
A 47-year-old man presenting with C7 ASIA B tetraplegia for 9 months, developed episodes of severe hypotension and occasional syncope following intermittent catheterisations. These episodes were observed in the minutes following the catheterisations performed in the sitting position, associating hypotension and bradycardia. He was on intermittent catheterisation, had a history of bladder hyper-reflexia with some episodes of symptomatic urinary tract infections, of mild autonomic dysreflexia (headache, sweating) on high bladder distension, of mild orthostatic hypotension, and of reactional depression to the trauma, treated with fluoxetine hydrochloride (Prozac).
The progressive removal of the fluoxetine hydrochloride (Prozac) led to disappearance of the syncope 1 week later. Mild hypotension after catheterisations still persisted though, but completely disappeared a few months later after further management of bladder hyper-reflexia with botulinum-A toxin injections into the detrusor.
In spinal cord injury patients at risk of micturition syncope, care should be taken to achieve a gradual decrease in bladder volume, to control bladder hyper-reflexia and to avoid any medications with orthostatic hypotension's side effects.

Abstract: Atypical antipsychotics (AAPs) are used as adjunct therapy in the treatment of resistant obsessive-compulsive symptoms (OCSs). Paradoxically other reports suggest that AAPs, particularly clozapine, risperidone, and olanzapine can induce de novo emergence or exacerbation of OCSs in psychotic patients. The authors present here the first report suggesting an association between de novo appearance of OCSs and quetiapine treatment in a schizophrenic patient.
The patient was a 33-year-old woman with the diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia, who displayed OCSs for the first time during treatment with quetiapine. The symptoms reduced remarkably when fluoxetine was added to her treatment regimen while keeping the quetiapine dosage unchanged.
AAP-induced OCSs merit consideration and early identification, as these drugs are now widely in use in clinical practice. This rare but disabling side effect should also be monitored in quetiapine treated schizophrenic patients.

Abstract: Hypochondriasis (HC) involves preoccupation with fears of having a serious illness. The preoccupation is persistent and based on misinterpretation of benign bodily sensations. In response, patients often resort to frequent checks with doctors, of their own body, and of medical references, to reassure themselves of their health status. Some authors have likened HC to obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) on the basis of similarities between obsessions and illness preoccupation and the ritualistic checking behavior observed in each condition.
In this article, the phenomenology of HC is discussed in terms of factors that account for the development and persistence of this disorder. Treatment that is derived from this conceptual model is also described.
HC is best considered as an anxiety problem in which pathological fear is focused on innocuous bodily sensations and other health-relevant cues.
Many of the psychological mechanisms of HC are similar to those present in OCD.

Abstract: Escitalopram is the purified functional isomer contained in citalopram. Escitalopram is now prescribed in 26 countries. In the United States, the only US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved selective serotonin reuptake inhibiter (SSRI) for adolescents is fluoxetine. However, in clinical practice all antidepressants are used in adolescents. Five patients had parents who opted for the use of escitalopram instead of other treatments. Reasons included poor response and side effects from other SSRIs. Specifically, escitalopram was considered possibly less likely to cause obesity than paroxetine. It also caused a lower frequency of akathisia than fluoxetine, more stable blood levels over years than sertraline, very low drug interactions, and a low onset of anxiety if using a 5-mg starting dose. Although studies in adolescents are very limited for escitalopram, its parent medication--citalopram--has been used in over 40 million patients. Parents and adolescent patients should be made aware of all antidepressant options, if psychopharmacology is indicated. In some patients, escitalopram may have use.

Abstract: Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a periodic, recurrent, debilitating condition with severe psychological or affective symptoms during the late luteal phase. PMDD often begins during adolescence. Dysregulation of the serotonergic system has been proposed recently as its cause and fluoxetine has been recommended as an appropriate treatment. We report 3 adolescents with PMDD who were treated for 2 years with fluoxetine, resulting in complete symptom resolution, and review the clinical trials supporting its use. Case reports of successfully treated teenagers are an addition to the accumulated evidence of the efficacy of fluoxetine for treatment of PMDD in adult women. Together they may provide some justification for the compassionate use of fluoxetine for adolescent girls who are being disabled by PMDD. However, more research is called for: a randomized placebo-controlled trial in adolescents is warranted.

Abstract: The phenomenological distinction between delusions and obsessions has been the subject of much debate in psychiatry. Some authors feel these symptoms are distinct nosological entities, while others argue that they reflect manifestations of the same symptom and are distinguishable on the basis of the level of insight a patient displays. In this report we describe the case history of a lady who presented with an obsessional disorder. The symptom was resistant to standard treatments and subsequently became more delusional in nature. We review the literature in terms of the classification of obsessions and delusions and offer assistance to clinicians in terms of the diagnosis and treatment of cases where the distinction between these phenomena is not clear and offer alternative means of classifying these symptoms based on insight.

Abstract: Risperidone is an atypical neuroleptic drug widely used due to the lower incidence and severity of hepatic adverse effects in comparison to phenothiazines. Although idiosyncratic reversible hepatotoxicity may occur in association with risperidone, the interaction with fluoxetine might increase the risk of toxic liver injury in a vulnerable patient.
We present a case of acute cholestatic hepatitis probably associated with the use of risperidone after only a few days of therapy in a patient also treated with fluoxetine. The patient, a 64-year-old male, developed a rapid increase in liver enzymes after starting treatment with only four doses of risperidone 2 mg/day.
We recommend obtaining baseline liver function tests before starting risperidone and regular monitoring to screen patients for liver damage during therapy whenever a patient is also receiving fluoxetine.

Abstract: Fluoxetine is an antidepressant drug, only recently discovered to be a QT interval prolonging agent. The first case is presented of an infant of a mother treated with fluoxetine during pregnancy who had a transiently prolonged QTc interval, concluded to be drug induced. Clinical and electrocardiographic monitoring of newborns of antidepressant treated mothers is needed.

Abstract: To report a case of antidepressant-induced adverse drug reactions in a patient with hemorrhagic stroke.
A 56-year-old man developed life-threatening adverse reactions after fluoxetine was added to his previously prescribed regimen of buspirone and olanzapine. One week after starting fluoxetine 60 mg/day, the patient developed syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion and serotonin syndrome concurrently. The patient had experienced a hemorrhagic stroke before the adverse drug reactions occurred.
A patient with a history of hemorrhagic stroke developed serious adverse drug reactions when fluoxetine was added to his drug therapy. When the combination therapy was stopped, all adverse effects gradually disappeared and laboratory abnormalities were corrected. The likelihood that the adverse reactions were caused by fluoxetine is probable according to the Naranjo probability scale. In addition, a history of stroke may be a risk factor for the development of such reactions.
Today, patients with depression after experiencing a stroke are treated more effectively, but antidepressant-induced adverse drug reactions may be serious. A growing number of patients are treated for post-stroke depression; they require close supervision and careful dosing of antidepressants to prevent full-blown adverse reactions from occurring.

Abstract: A 37-year-old male ingested 12 gm of fluoxetine approximately 2 hours prior to arrival at an emergency department. The patient developed tonic-clonic seizures, which resolved with diazepam and midazolam therapy. The patient then developed profound bradycardia that progressed to ventricular fibrillation and asystole. A postmortem toxicology analysis reported a fluoxetine concentration of 4500 mcg/L and diazepam of 500 mcg/L. No other drugs were detected. We report an unusual case of massive fluoxetine ingestion resulting in neurological and cardiovascular toxicity resulting in death.

Abstract: It is known that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, widely used as antidepressive drugs, act by inhibiting the cell reuptake of serotonin, but their effect on the catecholaminergic system is not yet completely understood. In this study, we investigated plasma concentrations of norepinephrine, epinephrine and dopamine after acute and chronic administration of fluoxetine in depressive patients. Twelve patients affected by major depression received a single oral dose of fluoxetine in the morning, 5 mg in the first 5 days, 10 mg from the 6th to the 10th day and 20 mg from the 11th to the 40th day. Twelve healthy subjects received a placebo under identical testing procedures. Blood samples were collected at baseline and 7, 10 and 24 h after drug administration on the 1st day of fluoxetine administration at a dose of 5 mg, and on the 1st and the 30th day of fluoxetine administration at a dose of 20 mg (days 11 and 40 of treatment, respectively). We found that plasma norepinephrine, epinephrine and dopamine levels significantly increased after acute and chronic treatment (p < 0.001), reaching the highest concentrations on the last day. No significant changes of these parameters were observed in control patients.

Abstract: To report QTc interval prolongation associated with combination therapy including levofloxacin, imipramine, and fluoxetine.
A 49-year-old white female presented to the emergency department with fever, aches, and pains for the past 3 days. She was diagnosed and treated for pyelonephritis in the hospital. Therapy included intravenous levofloxacin 500 mg every 24 hours and ceftriaxone 2 g every 24 hours, along with her medications upon admission, including imipramine 50 mg at bedtime and fluoxetine 10 mg/day. She was discharged after 5 days and returned the next day with chest tightness and shortness of breath. Upon the second admission, a 12-lead electrocardiogram showed a QTc interval of 509 msec. Levofloxacin was discontinued and the QTc interval fell to 403 msec. The patient was discharged 3 days later and instructed to consult with her primary care physician about discontinuing imipramine.
This adverse drug reaction is thought to be a pharmacodynamic additive effect among fluoxetine, imipramine, and levofloxacin. Fluoxetine is a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6, and imipramine is metabolized by CYP2D6. Therefore, fluoxetine is able to increase the plasma concentrations of imipramine, leading to QT interval prolongation. Taken with imipramine, levofloxacin can lead to even greater prolongation of the QT interval. Based on the Naranjo probability scale, levofloxacin was possibly associated with cardiac arrhythmias in our patient.
The use of levofloxacin alone, or more often in concomitant therapy with other medications that are known to prolong the QT interval, may cause QT interval prolongation; however, additional studies/case reports are needed to validate this conclusion.

Abstract: We describe a case of clozapine-induced seizures in a patient with treatment-resistant schizophrenia. She had previously been treated unsuccessfully with a number of atypical antipsychotic medications, before she was eventually started on clozapine. She experienced two separate episodes of observed fits whilst on an initial daily dose of 125 mg and, subsequently, on a daily dose of 237.5 mg. Following discontinuation of clozapine, she was rechallenged and again was observed to have seizures. Appropriate investigations ruled out any organic cause of the fits and clozapine was successfully restarted, together with sodium valproate. By the time of treatment stabilization, the patient had not experienced any further fits. These findings suggest that clozapine-induced seizures can be successfully treated, that gradual dose titration can reduce the likelihood of further episodes of seizures and that concomitant use of a suitable mood stabilizer/anti-epileptic medication can improve the outcome of treatment-resistant schizophrenia. Furthermore, the concomitant use of fluoxetine and clozapine is discouraged, with citalopram suggested as a suitable antidepressant in those depressed patients receiving clozapine.

Abstract: Serotonin syndrome (SS) is a potentially fatal complication of the combined use of agents that enhance serotonin activity. Bupropion inhibits noradrenaline and dopamine reuptake with milder effects on serotonergic activity. Although regarded as a potential causative agent for SS, no cases have been reported in the medical literature. A 62-year-old woman treated with therapeutic dosages of bupropion and sertraline for depression for the previous 3 weeks presented with upper extremity myoclonic jerks, clumsiness, and gait difficulties with fluctuating symptoms of confusion, forgetfulness, and the alternation of agitation and lethargy. Symptoms were interpreted as an aggravation of depression and venlafaxine was added. The clinical picture progressed to alteration of consciousness and dysautonomia. After admission, medications were discontinued and she was started on cyproheptadine and clonazepam with gradual improvement and complete resolution of symptoms. This is a rare report of SS related to the association of bupropion and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). It also illustrates the potential for misinterpretation of the earliest manifestations of SS as signs of aggravation of the patient's underlying condition. The role of bupropion in SS is possibly related to its well-established specific inhibition of the cytochrome P450 2D6 pathway, increasing blood levels of SSRIs and tricyclic antidepressants.

Abstract: Serotonin reuptake inhibitor induced sensory disturbances are reported rarely in the literature. This case report describes numbness and dysmorphic symptoms in the upper facial area associated with fluoxetine. There is no previous report of such an adverse reaction with any serotonin reuptake inhibitor in the literature and this report is intended to draw attention towards these unusual adverse effects.

Abstract: The skin contains a system for producing serotonin as well as serotonin receptors. Serotonin can also cause pruritus when injected into the skin. SSRI-drugs increase serotonin concentrations and are known to have pruritus and other dermal side effects.
A 46-year-old man consulted his doctor due to symptoms of depression. He did not suffer from any allergy but drinking red wine caused vasomotor rhinitis. Antidepressive treatment with fluoxetine 20 mg daily was initiated which was successful. After three weeks of treatment an itching rash appeared. An adverse drug reaction (ADR) induced by fluoxetine was suspected and fluoxetine treatment was discontinued. The symptoms disappeared with clemastine and betametasone treatment. Since the depressive symptoms returned sertraline medication was initiated. After approximately two weeks of sertraline treatment he noted an intense itching sensation in his scalp after eating a piece of chocolate cake. The itch spread to the arms, abdomen and legs and the patient treated himself with clemastine and the itch disappeared. He now realised that he had eaten a chocolate cake before this episode and remembered that before the first episode he had had a chocolate mousse dessert. He had never had any reaction from eating chocolate before and therefore reported this observation to his doctor.
This case report suggests that there may be individuals that are very sensitive to increases in serotonin concentrations. Dermal side reactions to SSRI-drugs in these patients may be due to high activity in the serotonergic system at the dermal and epidermo-dermal junctional area rather than a hypersensitivity to the drug molecule itself.

Abstract: Chromatographic separation of highly polar basic drugs with ideal ionspray mass spectrometry volatile mobile phases is a difficult challenge. A new quantification procedure was developed using hydrophilic interaction chromatography-mass spectrometry with turbo-ionspray ionization in the positive mode. After addition of deuterated internal standards and simple clean-up liquid extraction, the dried extracts were reconstituted in 500 microL pure acetonitrile and 5 microL was directly injected onto a Waters Atlantis HILIC 150- x 2.1-mm, 3-microm column. Chromatographic separations of cocaine, seven metabolites, and anhydroecgonine were obtained by linear gradient-elution with decreasing high concentrations of acetonitrile (80-56% in 18 min). This high proportion of organic solvent makes it easier to be coupled with MS. The eluent was buffered with 2 mM ammonium acetate at pH 4.5. Except for m-hydroxy-benzoylecgonine, the within-day and between-day precisions at 20, 100, and 500 ng/mL were below 7 and 19.1%, respectively. Accuracy was also below +/- 13.5% at all tested concentrations. The limit of quantification was 5 ng/mL (%Diff < 16.1, %RSD < 4.3) and the limit of detection below 0.5 ng/mL. This method was successfully applied to a fatal overdose. In Switzerland, cocaine abuse has dramatically increased in the last few years. A 45-year-old man, a known HIV-positive drug user, was found dead at home. According to relatives, cocaine was self-injected about 10 times during the evening before death. A low amount of cocaine (0.45 mg) was detected in the bloody fluid taken from a syringe discovered near the corpse. Besides injection marks, no significant lesions were detected during the forensic autopsy. Toxicological investigations showed high cocaine concentrations in all body fluids and tissues. The peripheral blood concentrations of cocaine, benzoylecgonine, and methylecgonine were 5.0, 10.4, and 4.1 mg/L, respectively. The brain concentrations of cocaine, benzoylecgonine, and methylecgonine were 21.2, 3.8, and 3.3 mg/kg, respectively. The highest concentrations of norcocaine (about 1 mg/L) were measured in bile and urine. Very high levels of cocaine were determined in hair (160 ng/mg), indicating chronic cocaine use. A low concentration of anhydroecgonine methylester was also found in urine (0.65 mg/L) suggesting recent cocaine inhalation. Therapeutic blood concentrations of fluoxetine (0.15 mg/L) and buprenorphine (0.1 microg/L) were also discovered. A relatively high concentration of Delta(9)-THC was measured both in peripheral blood (8.2 microg/L) and brain cortex (13.5 microg/kg), suggesting that the victim was under the influence of cannabis at the time of death. In addition, fluoxetine might have enhanced the toxic effects of cocaine because of its weak pro-arrhythmogenic properties. Likewise, combination of cannabinoids and cocaine might have increase detrimental cardiovascular effects. Altogether, these results indicate a lethal cocaine overdose with a minor contribution of fluoxetine and cannabinoids.

Abstract: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the addition of manual-based cognitive-behavioral therapy to a medication regimen of clomipramine and fluoxetine and the withdrawal of medication during cognitive-behavioral therapy. The participant was an 11-year-old girl with symptoms of obsessive thoughts about germs and illness and handwashing compulsions. The addition of cognitive-behavioral therapy reduced the participant's daily number of obsessions and avoidance behaviors after three sessions. When medication was tapered during the cognitive-behavioral therapy program, the participant's symptoms continued to decline, and after treatment, she no longer met diagnostic criteria for obsessive-compulsive disorder. Impressively, the participant remained medication free and treatment gains were maintained at 4 months' follow-up.

Abstract: Fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressant agent, has been implicated in learning and memory. Here, we report four cases from the same family of fluoxetine-related memory-impairment.
Memory-impairment resulted after fluoxetine treatment and disappeared after changing to another selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor.
There may be a relationship between fluoxetine-related memory impairment and genetic factors, and this side-effect appears to be specific to fluoxetine treatment. Possible mechanisms underlying this effect may be the drug's influence on the central serotonergic system or brain-derived neurotrophic factor.

Abstract: This is the first longitudinal report on possible psychosis resulting from the juvenile onset of hypothyroidism. A 10-year follow-up in the case of a 13-year-old boy published in this journal in 1993 is presented. The patient presented with a diagnostic dilemma. Although psychosis resulting from hypothyroidism was the most parsimonious explanation of his symptoms (new-onset auditory hallucinations, severe obsessions, and severe hypothyroidism), a primary psychiatric disorder (obsessive-compulsive disorder [OCD] or psychotic depression) aggravated by hypothyroidism could not be excluded. The aim of this study was to illustrate that the diagnosis and clinical interrelationships can be clarified by longitudinal data. FOLLOW-UP DATA: The patient's symptoms responded optimally to a combination of fluvoxamine, risperidone, and levothyroxine (LT4, 300 microg daily). He was free from severe symptoms until age 21, when he discontinued all psychotropic medications while continuing with LT4. Over 2 months later, he was hospitalized for thoughts of hurting himself or others. In the hospital, his LT4 was discontinued and propranolol was started. He was discharged on multiple psychotropic medications, and was rehospitalized 6 days later for suicide risk. When LT4 (200 microg daily) was added to his psychotropic regimen, he partially responded and was discharged. The optimal response to treatment occurred only after he was placed on a combination of fluoxetine, risperidone, and LT4 (300 microg daily). The patient remained stable for up to 12 months of follow-up.
This chronology suggests that the optimal treatment in this patient probably required three components: a Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor, (SSRI) risperidone, and LT4 (300 g daily). Each component was apparently necessary but not sufficient individually for the optimal response. The relapse after the discontinuation of fluvoxamine and risperidone (but not LT4) suggests the presence of a primary psychiatric disorder (OCD with depression). The failure to improve without an adequate dosage of LT4 suggests that hypothyroidism was probably an aggravating factor. This case illustrates the diagnostic difficulty in distinguishing between obsessions, depressive ruminations, and delusions in children and the need to consider hypothyroidism in the differential diagnosis of the sudden worsening of OCD, or in cases of new-onset psychosis in children and adolescents.

Abstract: Cholestatic liver injury can be caused by a variety of drugs and is difficult to treat. We report two patients, a 22 year old male and a 55 year old female, with drug induced cholestasis caused by anabolic-androgenic steroids (silabolin and nandrolone) and by fluoxetine, respectively. Both patients presented with massive jaundice and severe pruritus resulting in sleep deprivation and suicide ideation. Laboratory examination revealed signs of cholestasis. Medical treatment was ineffective; therefore, extracorporeal albumin dialysis using the molecular adsorbent recirculating system (MARS) was started. Three treatments with a mean duration of 16 hours were performed in each patient. The procedure was well tolerated by the patients and resulted in a sustained relief of pruritus as well as in a decline of plasma bilirubin and serum 3alpha-hydroxy bile acid levels. The mean plasma bilirubin concentration decreased from 25.27 mg/dl to 10.7 mg/dl; the mean serum 3alpha-hydroxy bile acid concentration decreased from 299 micromol/L to 88 micromol/L. After 2 months, the pruritus had nearly vanished in both patients, and there was a further decline of bilirubin levels after discharge from hospital. In conclusion, extracorporeal albumin dialysis appears to be a therapeutic option in severe drug induced cholestasis refractory to medical treatment.

Abstract: We report and discuss the case of a 55-year old man who presented a history of stroke as well as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. When admitted into the emergency room, he was diagnosed with a vertebro-basilar syndrome. A brain MRI showed a hyperintense area in the lower right brainstem laterally within the medulla, which corresponds to the area of the pathways descending from the autonomic breathing control center. During hospitalization, the patient had several episodes of prolonged apnea, mainly when asleep, having often to be "reminded" to breath. A tracheostomy was then performed with the patient under mechanical ventilation. Treatment with medroxyprogesterone, fluoxetine and acetazolamide was also started. He was discharged after 64 days breathing environmental air with no apparent episodes of apnea. He returned to the emergency room in the following day with a clinical picture of aspiration bronchopneumonia, followed by septic shock and death.
the Ondine's curse is one of the posterior stroke's presentation characterized by loss of automatic breathing and for the unpredictability of clinical evolution and prognosis. Such a syndrome has rarely been reported in adults and the diagnostic criteria are not consensual in the reviewed literature. Thus any diagnostic confirmation should be flexible. There are many therapeutic symptomatic options in such cases, ranging from pharmacologic approach, use of bilevel positive airway pressure and implantation of diaphragmatic pacemaker.

Abstract: Transdermal fentanyl is an opioid analgesic that is effective on chronic pain, and which appears to be advantageous due to several factors such as ease of administration, the relatively stable serum concentration and long dose intervals. Nevertheless, the danger of abuse and dependence exists among patients who are prescribed fentanyl patches. We present a case of transdermal fentanyl abuse, where the administration route of the drug was changed. Our patient, who had no history of substance abuse and who suffered from chronic nonmalignant pain, used the fentanyl transdermal patches as oral transmucosal medication, raising the dose by ten-fold. This abuse of the drug was only for analgesic purposes without seeking anxiolysis and/or euphoria. After treatment and progressive reduction of fentanyl, the patient remains in good condition, and is currently taking the initial dose of the drug transdermally, without having experienced any withdrawal symptoms.

Abstract: This article presents a case of factitious disorder in which a female smeared menstrual blood on her face. The patient was admitted to our otolaryngology clinic complaining of bleeding from the mouth, nose, ears and eyes. This event reportedly occurred three to four times on a daily basis. She acknowledged nine prior admissions to different specialists over the last two years. Following psychiatric consultation, we diagnosed factitious disorder with predominantly physical signs and symptoms. She was started on Fluoxetine 20 mg/day and supportive interviews were organized. After diagnosis, we observed that her symptoms decreased over two months. The symptoms did not reoccur three to nine months after treatment. This case report outlines two important features. The first is that a case of this type has not been reported before, and the second feature is that this case demonstrates the effect of cultural factors greatly different from those seen in classical factitious disorder.

Abstract: Unexpected ejaculation failure on the day of oocyte retrieval for IVF occurs once or twice a year in our Reproductive Medicine Unit, where approximately 500 oocyte retrievals are performed each year. Two clinical situations which occurred in 2001 are presented. In the first case, sperm were finally obtained by epididymal aspiration and resulted in the fertilization of five oocytes by ICSI. The transfer of two fresh embryos did not result in a pregnancy and the three supernumerary zygotes were cryopreserved. The male patient presented an anxio-depressive episode necessitating psychiatric hospitalization 1 week after the oocyte retrieval. In the second case, no sperm were obtained and the four oocytes were therefore lost. The couple went through a crisis in their relationship and tried another cycle of IVF 10 months later, after the preventive cryopreservation of a sperm sample. On the day of oocyte retrieval the patient was unable to produce a fresh sample but three zygotes were obtained through ICSI using the back-up cryopreserved sperm. Two embryos were transferred but no pregnancy ensued. The clinical decision-making processes for these two cases are described, as well as the measures employed to help prevent these unfortunate situations.

Abstract: The study of neurogenetic microdeletion syndromes provides an insight into the developmental psychopathology of psychiatric disorders. The aim of the study was to evaluate the prevalence of psychiatric disorders, especially obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), in patients with velocardiofacial syndrome (VCFS), a 22q11 microdeletion syndrome. Forty-three subjects with VCFS of mean age 18.3 +/- 10.6 years were comprehensively assessed using semi-structured psychiatric interview and the Yale-Brown obsessive compulsive scale (Y-BOCS). Best estimate diagnoses were made on the basis of information gathered from subjects, parents, teachers, and social workers. Fourteen VCFS subjects (32.6%) met the DSM-IV criteria for OCD. OCD had an early age of onset and generally responded to fluoxetine treatment. It was not related to mental retardation. The most common obsessive-compulsive symptoms were contamination, aggression, somatic worries, hoarding, repetitive questions, and cleaning. Sixteen of the 43 patients (37.2%) had attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and 7 (16.2%) had psychotic disorder. The results of our study suggest that there is a strong association between VCFS and early-onset OCD. This finding may be significant in the understanding of the underlying genetic basis of OCD.

Abstract: Lyndsey Bohanna, 23 years, had mild depression and was prescribed Prozac by doctors to combat insomnia and fatigue. Two months later during a routine check-up a junior doctor changed her prescription. He gave her an antidepressant, dothiepin, which is for severe depression and should not be used with Prozac. It is also an antidepressant with one of the highest chances of overdose. Nine days later she was found dead. An independent review found a host of errors during her treatment at the hospital. The junior doctor had not asked the consultant for advice and had not explained to the patient the risks associated with her new medication. He also failed to inform her GP of how many tablets should be given. What is the law?

Abstract: A 54-year-old male was observed driving erratically. The subject displayed both horizontal and vertical nystagmus and poor balance on field sobriety tests (FST's). Further observations included slow movements, breathing, and speech, extremely poor coordination, lack of convergence, and pupils with slow reaction to light. The subject related he was seeing roadway lines doubled and felt a hallucinogenic effect. Breath alcohol results were negative. Blood tests found zolpidem and fluoxetine in addition to hydrocodone at therapeutic levels. This case is presented as an example of hallucinogenic effects from the combination of zolpidem and serotonin reuptake inhibitors.

Abstract: Nurses need to become more aware of serotonin syndrome to avoid its development and to ensure a therapeutic response when early symptoms emerge. While polypharmacy tends to put individuals at greatest risk for the syndrome, use of a single serotonergic agent may also provoke an adverse response. Because the onset and progression of serotonin syndrome are rapid, prompt action may be needed to avoid potentially life-threatening consequences.

Abstract: We report the case of a 22-year-old woman presenting major depressive episode with severe akathisia after an increase in fluoxetine. The patient developed severe restlessness and de novo suicidal ideation approximately 1 week after the dosage of fluoxetine was doubled, 1 year on from when the drug was first introduced. This case illustrates the importance of being alert to movement disorders in patients treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. The clinical implications are discussed. A management strategy based on the evidence in the existing literature is suggested.

Abstract: There is infrequent discussion of long-term psychotherapy of persons with addiction, particularly in the self-psychology literature. In addition, some question whether long-term psychotherapy can be helpful in severe psychiatric disorders. The author describes the treatment of a woman with multiple diagnoses, including bulimia and alcohol and drug addiction, which took place over a period of almost 7 years. These issues are addressed from a self-psychological perspective, with progression of the treatment from early facilitation of a selfobject transference to more intense selfobject transference-countertransference states. Behavioral interventions (e.g., recommendation of inpatient chemical dependency treatment) are also discussed. The author describes the patient's dramatic progress and subsequent regression. Finally, there is a discussion of the addiction from self-psychological and biological perspectives of this woman's particular developmental and treatment issues, as well as a discussion of the confrontation and limit setting in a self-psychologically oriented treatment.

Abstract: This paper describes a Bosnian refugee, a survivor of war and ethnic cleansing, during a 3-year follow-up in a psychiatry clinic.
This case throws light on the tension between medicotherapeutic and sociomoral ways of understanding the effects of such experiences, and of the limitations of morally and politically neutral psychiatric categories and technologies. Suffering always invokes questions of values: in this case the clinical picture represented a moral protest at what had been done with such impunity, and a refusal to accommodate to a world which now seemed unintelligible. The clinical picture also embodied the collective outrage, and sense of unfinished business, which many back in Bosnia itself were carrying in the wake of the 1995 Dayton peace accords which effectively legitimised the lines of ethnic cleansing.
DSM or ICD diagnoses of depressive disorder or post-traumatic stress disorder turned out to lack validity and explanatory power. Claims that victims of war and atrocity typically have an unmet need for mental health services are overstated. Recovery from the effects of war may depend on reestablishing a sense of intelligibility, a task that must primarily go on in social space rather than mental space.

Abstract: Sexual dysfunction is a common complaint among patients taking selective serotonin reuptake-inhibiting (SSRI) antidepressants. Many options in managing this side effect have been described but none clearly is a first choice among clinicians. This paper describes the first published case of a patient having successful reversal of SSRI-induced sexual dysfunction by switching from an SSRI to escitalopram, the newest antidepressant and SSRI approved for use in the United States. Clinical implication is discussed.

Abstract: To report a case of severe memory loss in an elderly patient after initiation of fluoxetine.
An 87-year-old white woman was started on fluoxetine for depression, and the dose was titrated to 20 mg/d. She developed progressive memory loss over the next 6 weeks for which she ultimately was hospitalized. Other potential causes for her memory loss were ruled out. After fluoxetine was discontinued, the patient's memory improved significantly over the next 2 months. An objective causality assessment indicated a possible relationship between the memory loss and fluoxetine in this patient.
Our report documents a case of severe reversible memory deterioration after initiating fluoxetine. Fluoxetine has a favorable adverse effect profile when compared with older classes of antidepressants. Postmarketing studies and isolated case reports, however, suggest that fluoxetine may harm memory in some patients. Some selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) appear to cause memory loss more frequently than others.
Clinicians should be aware of the possible effects of fluoxetine (and possibly other SSRIs) on memory.

Abstract: While hormone replacement therapy (HRT) has not been shown to be an effective treatment for major depression, preliminary studies suggest that estrogen may potentiate the effect of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.
In an ongoing study, perimenopausal women diagnosed with major depression were randomly assigned to one of three treatment conditions: (1) fluoxetine 10-20 mg alone, (2) estradiol patch 0.1-0.2 mg alone or (3) the combination of fluoxetine 10-20 mg and estradiol patch 0.1-0.2 mg.
In the five cases presented here, the combination of fluoxetine and estradiol was most effective, followed by fluoxetine alone and then estradiol alone.
These are selected cases from an ongoing study and do not represent statistically significant data.
These preliminary cases suggest that estrogen can enhance the efficacy of antidepressant medication in menopausal women and this adjunctive treatment strategy may be superior to antidepressant or estrogen alone. Further research is needed in elucidating the mechanisms by which estrogen may enhance antidepressant action in perimenopausal women.

Abstract: Circulating thyroid autoantibodies are more prevalent in patients with mood disorders than in the general population, but longitudinal clinical data that establish a relationship between thyroid antibody status and the course of any psychiatric syndrome have been lacking. In addition, scant attention has been paid to thyroid hormones and autoimmunity in borderline personality disorder (BPD). We report a case of a patient with classic BPD whose fluctuating mood and, especially, psychotic symptoms-rated using a double-blind method-were directly linked to antithyroglobulin antibody titers serially determined over an inpatient period of 275 d. Significantly lower psychosis and depression ratings were seen during a 4-wk period of relatively low antithyroid antibody titers, during blinded treatment with carbamazepine, than were observed during two high autoantibody epochs. The significant positive correlations between nurse- and patient-rated depression and thyroid autoantibodies over the entire period of inpatient study were similar to those also observed between urinary free cortisol levels and depression; the positive correlation between antithyroglubulin antibody titers and psychotic symptoms was stronger (r = +0.544; p < 0.002). Although this patient had biochemical indices of primary hypothyroidism, she showed only marginal improvement to triiodothyronine (T3) and no apparent clinical response to sustained levorotatory thyroxine (T4) administration; neither were antithyroid antibody titers significantly associated with changes in T3, free T4, or thyroid-stimulating hormone concentrations. She clinically deteriorated during a 50-d fluoxetine trial. The present data demonstrate a clinically significant, longitudinal correlation between fluctuating antithyroid antibody titers and symptoms of borderline psychopathology in our patient. It will be of interest to determine the prevalence, pathophysiologic mechanisms, and treatment implications of this putative autoimmune- BPD link.

Abstract: A 48-year-old man with a history of ethanol abuse and bipolar disease fell asleep while smoking in an intoxicated state. The patient received a 30% total body surface area burn involving his face and upper torso that resulted in an inhalation injury. Several attempts at weaning from mechanical ventilation failed due to his extreme agitation, which was unresponsive to benzodiazepines, opiates, and antipsychotic agents. Propofol therapy was begun in combination with valproic acid, fluoxetine, and risperidone to assist in the treatment of his severe agitation associated with the bipolar disease, inhibiting ventilatory weaning. Repeated attempts to discontinue propofol were associated with withdrawal symptoms such as severe agitation, tremors, tachycardia, tachypnea, and hyperpyrexia. His symptoms resolved only after each time the propofol infusion was restarted. The patient received propofol for 95 days for management of his agitation before dying from refractory septic shock and multiple organ failure.

Abstract: We report a case of severe hypokalemia and flaccid muscle paralysis following a suicide attempt associating the calcium channel blocker amlodipine, the antidepressant fluoxetine and barium carbonate. Despite rapid correction of severe, life-threatening hypokalemia, areflexic quadriplegia persisted, suggesting a direct effect of barium on muscle cells. Continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) was initiated. We determined barium concentration in the urine, plasma, and hemodiafiltrate during CVVHDF. We subsequently calculated the amounts of barium eliminated both by the CVVHDF and the kidneys. CVVHDF triples the measured barium elimination, reduced serum barium half-life by a factor of three, stabilized serum potassium levels, and rapidly improved motor strength, with complete neurological recovery within 24 h. Presentation and treatment of barium intoxication are discussed.

Abstract: This case report presents a severe case of anorexia nervosa in a 15-year-old female adolescent. The patient suffered from extreme weight loss and agitation that required hospitalization in the Intensive Care Unit. The initial treatment consisted of fluoxetine management. Marked improvements, both in weight and psychological adjustment, were observed with the later addition of olanzapine. The findings reported here support previous findings that suggest the beneficial use of olanzapine in the treatment of anorexia nervosa.

Abstract: This case report describes a patient with a history of neurocardiogenic syncope, who had had a negative head-up tilt test with isoprenaline, but he experienced a prolonged asystole during a head-up tilt test with clomipramine (serotonin reuptake inhibitor) 24 h later. This patient was successfully treated with fluoxetine.

Abstract: The development of neuropathic pain following stroke is not uncommon. The consequences include significant disabilities and depression. Treatment can often be difficult and responses unsatisfactory. We report a patient with severe central post-stroke pain (CPSP) of the right leg benefiting from a combination of Western multidisciplinary therapies AND acupuncture. A literature search has revealed that relatively few studies have been done on the management of CPSP, compared with other types of neuropathic pain. Amitriptyline and carbamazepine were found to produce positive effects on post-stroke pain in one small study; lamotrigine and gabapentin are two newer drugs which appear promising. To the best of our knowledge, the use of acupuncture for the treatment of CPSP has not been previously reported.

Abstract: The clinical significance of an interstitial duplication of (15)(q11-q13) remains unclear and controversial. The reported phenotypes vary widely and appear to be influenced by the parent of origin of the duplication. Aside from cases of dup(15) reported with autism, the behavioral phenotype of individuals with dup(15) has not been described. We present three families, two with intrachromosomal duplication (15)(q11-q13) ascertained because of developmental delay in a relative. Two families show clear evidence of multigenerational maternal inheritance. The individuals discussed in this paper have minor anomalies and developmental delays. In addition, we describe a behavioral phenotype which often includes attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autistic spectrum disorder. Responses to medications used to manage these behaviors are also described, including a positive response to methylphenidate and a poor response to fluoxetine. The duplication in each presenting individual, and available family members, was investigated utilizing cytogenetic and molecular techniques including high resolution cytogenetics, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), DNA methylation studies, and quantitative fluorescence PCR. High resolution cytogenetic techniques alone missed some cases, demonstrating the need to confirm results with other methods.

Abstract: Zolpidem is an imidazopyridine hypnotic that is believed to act selectively at alpha(1) subunit-containing gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A)) receptors and thus to have minimal abuse and dependence potential. We present three cases of zolpidem abuse and dependence in which the drug was used not for sedation but for stimulation and anxiolysis. All of the patients were treated with fluoxetine (a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) and managed to discontinue the abuse and remain abstinent from the drug. The efficacy of this kind of medication on the abuse of a GABAergic agonist, in this case dependence on zolpidem, leads to a serotonergic and GABAergic system interaction hypothesis.

Abstract: Controlled trials in patients with bulimia nervosa have demonstrated efficacy of antidepressant medications with serotonergic function (e.g. fluoxetine) as well as noradrenergic function (e.g. desipramine). Sixteen out-patients with bulimia nervosa according to DSM-IV criteria were treated in a drug surveillance with 100 mg of milnacipran, a specific serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor (SNRI). Ten patients completed the 8-week observation period. The reasons for premature attrition were improvement in one patient (no. 12), a generalized exanthema in one patient (no. 7), severe nausea in one patient (no. 8) and non-compliance due to non-drug-related reasons in three patients (no. 1, 2, and 16). An intent-to-treat analysis exhibited a significant reduction in weekly binge eating and vomiting frequency from baseline to the end of treatment. Three patients stopped binge eating and purging completely during the last week of treatment. Furthermore, there was a concomitant decrease of depression ratings (HAMD, BDI). Our preliminary data give rise to the notion that milnacipran may be promising in the treatment of bulimia nervosa.

Abstract: A captive adult male Bengal tiger (Panthera tigris tigris) was treated for chronic footpad ulcers associated with pacing on concrete cage surfaces. Combination therapy of oral fluoxetine and acepromazine administration to diminate pacing behavior, daily application of moisturizing ointment, and oral vitamin E supplementation resulted in complete resolution of all footpad lesions. Subsequent clinical episodes completely resolved with similar treatments.

Abstract: To discuss special behavioural problems shown by a patient with Asperger's disorder from adolescence onward.
The case and treatment of a 21-year-old male patient is described.
A 21-year-old male developed obstinate stealing behaviours when he was 17 years old. He was regarded as a schizophrenic at first, and was suspected of kleptomania later. Asperger's disorder was diagnosed after we reconsidered the relationship between the schizoid psychopathy in childhood and the stealing behaviours which occurred in adolescence.
A wide variety of bizarre behaviours and so-called borderline behaviours occur in late adolescence and adult life of patients with Asperger's disorder. But classic schizophrenia is very rare. Psychiatrists unacquainted with the clinical diagnosis/context may find it difficult to evaluate 'concrete', 'childish', or 'bizarre' symptoms in patients with Asperger's disorder, and thus are prone to misdiagnose them as having schizophrenia disorders or other similar disorders.

Abstract: To report the case of a patient with serotonin syndrome induced by low-dose venlafaxine.
A 29-year-old Taiwanese woman with major depressive disorder abruptly developed serotonin syndrome during low-dose (37.5 mg/d) venlafaxine monotherapy, with symptoms of restlessness, tremor, shivering, diarrhea, vomiting, ataxia, tachycardia, and myoclonus. The patient recovered in 2 hours after receiving prochlorperazine and lorazepam in the emergency department. Venlafaxine was discontinued, and she was discharged home. Two weeks later, the patient started to receive fluoxetine 20 mg/d and reported no adverse adverse effects during follow-up clinic visits.
The clinical manifestations of this case meet Sternbach's criteria of serotonin syndrome. Its possible etiologic factors include panic attack, adverse drug reaction, pharmacodynamic interaction, and congenital absence of CYP2D6 enzyme activity. The Naranjo probability scale suggested a probable causality of venlafaxine treatment and serotonin syndrome.
Clinicians should be aware of the risk of serotonin syndrome when the patient receives not only a combination of 2 antidepressants, but also the single potent serotonergic agent venlafaxine.

Abstract: Serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SRIs), clomipramine and selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs), are the first-line pharmacologic therapies for patients with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). However, 40 to 60 per cent of patients do not respond to adequate treatment trials of SRIs. SRI partial- and non-responders must be treated with augmentation strategies or put on another SRI since non-response to the first SRI does not necessarily indicate a non-response to a second SRI. Each treatment trial should run at least 10 weeks and if successful, the drug should be continued for at least 1 to 2 years and withdrawn gradually. The presented patient had a second episode of OCD which was resistant to more than 10 weeks of high dosage clomipramine even though he responded very well during the first episode 4 years earlier and had been off clomipramine for 3 years. Augmentation to clomipramine with lithium and then haloperidol consecutively also failed. When clomipramine was changed to fluoxetine, the OCD symptoms were responsive even at a starting dosage of 20 mg/day. The response improved as the dosage of fluoxetine was increased. The response reached a maximum and the patient coped very well in every aspect of daily life when the dosage of fluoxetine was increased to 60 mg/day. He had taken fluoxetine at this daily dosage for one year before the drug was tapered off. It has now been more than two years since he has had any OCD symptoms and clomipramine was terminated.

Abstract: Serotonergic-type side effects (like diarrhoea, hyperthermia, nausea, confusion) were seen after phototherapy in patients receiving fluoxetine or sertraline. Phototherapy was discontinued and symptoms completely resolved. In the authors' opinion, the symptoms were likely to be associated with specific interaction (serotonin effect potentialisation). To the authors' knowledge this is the first report concerning such an effect.

Abstract: We present the case of a young woman with treatment-resistant major depression, who presented to the Mood Disorders Clinic with a Hamilton Psychiatric Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D-21) score of 28, after a year-long treatment with Effexor-XR. The patient also had untreated Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS). The resolution of her depressive symptoms resulted from the treatment for PCOS with metformin and spironolactone. The patient remained euthymic 5 months after discontinuation of the antidepressant while continuing therapy for PCOS. We briefly overview of the pertinent literature of the pathophysiology of PCOS and affective disorders, highlighting an overlap in phenotypical presentations between these two disorders. Dysregulation of the hypothalamo-pituitary axis and various end organ systems are implicated in both PCOS and affective disorders. As such, several clinical and biochemical markers are common to both disorders, namely insulin resistance, obesity, and hyperandrogenism. In addition, these metabolic abnormalities are interrelated, causing women with PCOS or affective disorders to get caught in a "vicious cycle" of hormonal dysregulation. The case report presented here illustrates how treatment of symptoms such as insulin resistance and hyperandrogenism can lead to remission of major depressive disorder and PCOS. We suggest that through treatment of underlying metabolic defects, both the mood of the patient and the metabolic condition of PCOS can be assisted.

Abstract: There appears to be considerable symptomatic overlap between neuroleptic withdrawal reactions and the serotonin syndrome. This case report is of an 8-year-old boy who developed symptoms compatible with both conditions while discontinuing pimozide and starting fluoxetine. It illustrates how the use of neuroleptic medication in young children is not without the risk of serious adverse drug events and can complicate diagnostic issues. This case report supports the suggestion that adverse drug reactions related to neuroleptics and serotonergic agents could be part of the same clinical and neurophysiological spectrum.

Abstract: Medications that act on the central nervous system are frequently used in people infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Actually, drug interactions are an important factor in the treatment of patients with (HIV) infection and because of the complexity of the current drug regimens, clinicians should be trained in order to recognize and manage drug interactions. Herein, we present an HIV infected male admitted for manic behavior and treated with risperidone who developed a profound coma secondary to increased levels of risperidone because of a possible drug interaction with ritonavir and indinavir. Subsequently, we discuss this interaction, rarely described in the literature. Risperidone is a cytochrome P450 (CYP2D6) enzyme substrate and weak inhibitor and a CYP3A4 substrate. Possible interactions with CYP2D6 inhibitors (amiodarone, fluoxetine or ritonavir) and CYP3A4 inhibitors (indinavir and ritonavir) can increase its serum concentrations and produce significant adverse effects. In conclusion, this drug combination should be administered with caution and routinely examined for signs and symptoms of risperidone toxicity. Dosages should be reduced as needed. Finally, we think that in patients taking multiple medications, plasma levels of risperidone should be monitored especially if drug interactions are possible.

Abstract: Painful ejaculation has been reported in association with a variety of antidepressants such as the tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs, e.g. clomipramine, imipramine, desipramine, protriptyline, amoxapine), the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs, e.g. fluoxetine), venlafaxine and the MAOIs. Apart from lowering the dose and changing the antidepressant, no strategies are available to treat this side effect. In this paper, painful ejaculation following the administration of reboxetine is described in two patients. Both patients were treated concomitantly with the selective alpha(1A)-adrenoceptor antagonist, tamsulosin. A re-challenge was performed in one patient. The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), the American Urological Association symptom index, a (dis)satisfaction item score and the Udvalg for Kliniske Undersoegelser (UKU-side effect rating scale) were used to assess the treatment. Tamsulosin rapidly and completely resolved the painful ejaculation and urinary hesitancy in both patients. A re-challenge in one patient resulted in a prompt reappearance of both side effects. Tamsulosin resolved the problem of painful ejaculation in these patients; however, larger studies are needed to confirm these results.

Abstract: We report a case of a 39-year-old male with bipolar affective disorder who was admitted to hospital with an intentional acute lithium intoxication resulting in renal insufficiency. The patient had previously been treated with lithium, risperidone, fluoxetine and lorazepam, and successfully titrated to lithium levels of 0.7 mmol/l. After overdosing, the lithium level was 5.89 mmol/l and haemodialysis was initiated. A full pharmacokinetic time profile of lithium was obtained. After successful haemodialysis treatment, lithium levels recovered below toxic levels of 1.5 mmol/l in 53 hr. Without intervention non-toxic levels were not expected to have been reached within 6 days, based on computer simulation of predialysis levels. The patient was discharged 6 days after admission without residual symptoms. It was concluded that the lithium intoxication resulted from a combination of lithium overdose and subsequent renal insufficiency due to the overdose. A possible fluoxetine-risperidone interaction was not considered clinically apparent.

Abstract: We present a 15-year-old girl with depression, an obsessive compulsive disorder and conduct disorder, who developed EPS (torticollis, bradykinesia and cogwheel rigidity) while on fluoxetine. No other cause of EPS was present. The patient responded well to benztropine but re-experienced EPS when benztropine was stopped. Fluoxetine and benztropine were used concomitantly for 21.2 months and the patient has been off medication for 2 months without EPS. This case report shows that EPS can and does occur in youth with SSRI. Clinicians should be aware of the SSRIs as a potential causative factor for EPS.

Abstract: A 41-year-old amenorrheic woman started taking venlafaxine 37.5 mg/day for treatment of depression; 7 days later, she experienced vaginal bleeding, which ceased 1 day after she stopped taking the drug. On rechallenge with venlafaxine, she again experienced vaginal bleeding that resolved after discontinuation. We found no published reports describing vaginal bleeding associated with venlafaxine. However, premarketing and postmarketing data report similar adverse effects in patients taking the agent. In addition, several cases of menstrual irregularities have occurred with two other antidepressants: fluoxetine and bupropion. This case report supports previous surveillance data indicating that venlafaxine may cause vaginal bleeding.

Abstract: The syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) is a rare but serious adverse effect of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Although many case reports describe this association, few report the effect of rechallenge with another SSRI. We present a case of an elderly patient who developed hyponatremia with sertraline and SIADH when rechallenged with fluoxetine.

Abstract: Objective of this paper was to examine a possible treatment option for two disorders currently lacking agreed upon pharmacotherapeutic interventions. We report a patient fulfilling DSM-IV criteria for kleptomania with comorbid compulsive sexual behavior who failed to respond to fluoxetine, behavioral therapy, and psychotherapy, and who was therefore treated with naltrexone to reduce urges to steal and sexual urges. Treatment with high-dose naltrexone (150 mg/day) led to remission of both the patient's urges to steal and sexual urges. Discontinuation and rechallenge with the medication provides further support that improvement was due to naltrexone. Naltrexone in high doses show promise for the treatment of both kleptomania and compulsive sexual behavior.

Abstract: The use of herbal medicines has become a very common practice. While many are safe enough to be available over-the-counter, they may pose risks due to interactions with pharmaceutical medications and effects in specific clinical populations. The case of a female patient with a history of mild traumatic brain injury and resulting depression is presented. She experienced hypomania after adding St John's wort and Ginkgo biloba to her regimen of fluoxetine and buspirone, which remitted after discontinuation of the herbal medicines. Implications for interactions between various psychopharmacologic agents, including herbal medicines and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), as well as the need for appropriate patient and health care provider education are discussed.

Abstract: Recurrent Brief Depression (RBD) is a prevalent condition among the depressive illnesses, and is characterized by depressive episodes of a few days' duration occurring almost every month that are unrelated to the menstruation cycle. So far, RBD has not been shown to respond to antidepressive treatment in controlled clinical trials with citalopram, fluoxetine, flupenthixol, paroxetine, or mianserin using a "classical" parallel group design. However, successful RBD treatment on about sixty patients has so far been reported in one open trial with fluoxetine and in several cases with lithium, mirtazapine, and tranylcypromine. Furthermore, successful treatment of RBD has been reported in a few patients with carbamazepine, nimodipine, and verapamil in controlled double-blind single-case analyses using a flexible cross-over design.

Abstract: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are one of the most frequently prescribed classes of drugs. Rashes induced by SSRIs seldom have been reported in the literature. Computerized MEDLINE and Current Contents searches yielded a report of two cases of rash induced specifically by paroxetine. We describe a patient who developed a rash that appeared on day 3 of treatment with oral paroxetine 20 mg/day. Her rash was morbilliform, pruritic, and generalized over the trunk and limbs, with some facial involvement. There was no palm or sole involvement. The patient reported that she had experienced a similar reaction to fluoxetine, which may suggest a drug class effect. The rash resolved within 2 days of drug discontinuation and treatment with oral diphenhydramine and topical hydrocortisone cream.

Abstract: To describe a patient who developed serotonin syndrome on four separate occasions as a result of monotherapy with two different selective serotonin receptor inhibitors (fluoxetine and cetalopram).
Case report.
Community hospital.
Single patient with four episodes of serotonin syndrome.
The syndrome was characterized by coma/unresponsiveness (four episodes), dilated pupils (four episodes), salivation (two episodes), dryness of mouth (two episodes), myoclonus like activity of eyelids (four episodes), oculogyric crisis (four episodes), flaccid paralysis of all extremities (four episodes), tremors (two episodes), apnea (two episodes), restlessness (one episode). Recovery occurred within 24 hrs, although muscle pain and weakness persisted for 2 months after stopping fluoxetine. Apnea occurred in both episodes associated with fluoxetine therapy.
Apnea and coma may occur in serotonin syndrome.

Abstract: Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a common psychiatric disorder. It may go unrecognized, however, as many patients are embarrassed by their symptoms and are thus reluctant to report them. Recent research findings on OCD point to neurologic dysfunction in the circuitry of the orbitofrontal cortex and basal ganglia. The advent of the use of serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) as well as behavioral therapy has greatly improved treatment outcomes for patients with OCD. Given the likelihood that these patients are encountered in primary care consultations, physicians have the opportunity to play a crucial role in the early identification and proper treatment of OCD.

Abstract: Depressive disorders are frequently managed with long-term use of antidepressant medication. Even though the newer generation of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants exhibits a more favorable short-term, side-effect profile, effects of chronic use of such drugs remain unknown. Considering the limited data available on long-term, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor management, we report for the first time on two cases of late-onset adverse effects occurring 6 and 10 years after chronic-fluoxetine treatment in which patients experienced symptoms of restlessness, tension, agitation, and sleep disturbances. Symptoms resolved after reduction or cessation of the medication. Our case reports suggest the existence of a late-onset side-effect profile, which appears similar to acute side-effect symptomatology. Super sensitivity of the serotonin-related receptors may develop over the long-term and account for the phenomenon. Careful clinical monitoring is recommended to detect any late-onset, medication-related side effects.

Abstract: To report a case of aggravation of glaucoma associated with the use of fluvoxamine.
A 66-year-old while woman diagnosed with narrow-angle glaucoma showed an increase in intraocular pressure and experienced orbital pain and blurred vision after the initiation of fluvoxamine for tension-type headache. These symptoms disappeared and intraocular pressure normalized after withdrawal of this drug.
Aggravation of narrow-angle glaucoma is a well-known adverse effect of tricyclic antidepressants. Because this adverse effect had been rarely reported to date with selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (paroxetine and fluoxetine), we used fluvoxamine in our patient. The disappearance of ocular symptoms and the normalization of intraocular pressure two days after stopping fluvoxamine suggest a possible relationship between fluvoxamine and aggravation of glaucoma.
Fluvoxamine should be considered as a drug that can induce or aggravate narrow-angle glaucoma.

Abstract: A patient undergoing management of heroin dependency with high dosages of the long-acting methadone derivative, levomethadyl acetate HCl (LAAM; ORLAAM) developed a prolonged QTc interval and polymorphic QRS complexes on EKG consistent with torsades de pointes (TdP). The patient was taking other drugs known to prolong the QTc interval (fluoxetine and IV cocaine), and those known to antagonize the activity of the P450 enzymes responsible for the metabolism of LAAM and its active metabolite (fluoxetine, cocaine and marijuana). No previous reports have appeared in the literature attributing this adverse event to LAAM therapy; however, five similar cases have been reported to the manufacturer. Animal studies indicate that LAAM and metabolites prolong the action potential duration of myocardial cells. We propose that predisposed patients on high doses of LAAM may be at risk for developing TdP. Patients being treated with LAAM should receive dosages consistent with guidelines and be evaluated for concomitant diseases, interacting drug therapies, and EKG abnormalities.

Abstract: The efficacy of specific serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) has been established, but more than 40% of patients continue to have a poor response to SSRI. Low-dose antipsychotic augmentation of SSRI has contributed to the amelioration of symptoms in the treatment of refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder patients. Due to the risk of side effects from traditional antipsychotics, atypical novel antipsychotic augmentation of SSRI may be a good choice in the treatment of refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder. Herein we report our experience with two OCD patients, one with a poor response to fluoxetine 80 mg per day for 3 months, and the other with poor response to fluoxetine 60 mg per day for 3 months. Both OCD patients also proved to have a poor response to paroxetine 60 mg per day for 6 weeks. Neither patient had received any psychotherapy or behavioral therapy. Both patients showed significant improvement in their obsessive-compulsive symptoms as measured by the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS), after risperidone 1 mg per day was added to their on-going use of paroxetine 60 mg per day. Within 4 weeks of adding risperidone, the two patients' Y-BOCS scores had decreased by 57% and 53%. This result suggests that risperidone augmentation of SSRI may be a good choice and an effective treatment strategy for refractory OCD.

Abstract: To report a case of hypoglycemia that occurred in a patient treated with the selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitor, sertraline.
An 82-year-old white woman with mild cardiovascular disease and no history of glucose intolerance was seen in the emergency department for a presyncopal episode associated with a blood glucose of 32 mg/dL as measured by the ambulance attendant. She had similar symptoms the day before. Despite repeated administration of oral and intravenous glucose, the patient had recurrent episodes of hypoglycemia and was hospitalized for four days. She had started taking sertraline 50 mg once daily for mild depression 25 days prior to presentation. Other medications included furosemide 20 mg/d, ramipril 5 mg/d, clopidogrel 75 mg/d, nitroglycerin patch 0.4 mg/h, and lorazepam 1 mg taken occasionally for agitation. She had never been prescribed any oral hypoglycemic agents. Serum sertraline and desmethylsertraline concentrations measured two, three, and four days after discontinuing sertraline were within the expected range, but the rate of decline was consistent with a moderately prolonged half-life.
Sertraline has been shown to blunt postprandial hyperglycemia in rats and to potentiate the hypoglycemic effects of sulfonylurea agents in humans. It has not been reported to cause hypoglycemia independently, but in this case, a nondiabetic patient experienced multiple episodes of hypoglycemia that resolved after discontinuation of sertraline.
This report and another implicating fluoxetine in a case of hypoglycemia suggest that healthcare professionals should consider these medications among the possible causes of hypoglycemia occurring in patients receiving selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors.

Abstract: Obsessive Compulsive Disorder is one of the increasing psychological disorders. If not detected early and treated properly, obsessive-compulsive disorder usually becomes an incapacitating illness adversely affecting almost all aspects of the patient's life. Outpatient behavioral and pharmacotherapies frequently fail. This is a report on a severe case of obsessive-compulsive disorder that was treated as an in-patient with both behavior and pharmacotherapies, she was then followed up for 5 years with no relapse. The case reflects the importance and the need for in-patient units for severe resistant obsessive compulsive cases especially in Saudi Arabia where we have an increasing number of such cases.

Abstract: The past fifteen years have seen a marked change in the attitude of psychoanalysts toward the use of medication in psychoanalysis, yet few detailed case studies have appeared in which the effects of the introduction of a medication on the psychoanalytic process have been studied. A plea for fluoxetine (Prozac) as a weight-loss aid, from a female patient whose analysis had progressed satisfactorily, set in motion a remarkable series of events. Her mood brightened, she rapidly lost weight, and she ultimately realized that she had the fantasy of being impregnated, all of which represented the reenactment of crucial childhood experiences. The most significant change in the psychoanalytic process was a newfound ability to experience critical thoughts and feelings, which previously had been prohibited by her harsh superego. At first both patient and analyst believed that the medication had "softened" her superego, but reexamination of the data revealed that most, if not all, of the changes could be attributed to the transference meaning of the collaboration rather than to the effects of the drug.

Abstract: Compromised organ donors are generally not accepted for heart transplantation (HT) despite the increasing number of critically ill patients on the waiting lists. By extending the donor criteria to include certain cases of intoxication, the organ shortage may be reduced.
The case of a successful orthotopic HT with an allograft from a donor poisoned by antidepressant overdose is presented.
Early graft function was satisfactory with anteroseptal dyskinesis and an ejection fraction of 75% on echocardiography. The cardiac allograft recipient suffered some postoperative complications including gastrointestinal problems. The following period was up to now uneventful. Discharge from the intensive care unit was after 4 days. In-hospital stay was prolonged at 26 days.
Because of limited myocardial toxicity, donor hearts from certain victims of antidepressant intoxication may be safely used for HT. Existing cardiac organ donor criteria must be reevaluated to maximise the available organ pool.

Abstract: We report a case of a 32-year-old woman who developed paroxysmal episodes of right hemidystonia 2 days after taking fluoxetine. The attacks subsided 2 days after fluoxetine was withdrawn and did not recur afterwards. To our knowledge, this is the first report of paroxysmal dystonia induced by fluoxetine.

Abstract: A 39-y-o male with a history of human immunodeficiency virus infection and depression was admitted for diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis and pneumocystis carinii pneumonia infections. Prior to admission, he was on 50 mg trazodone every evening for 2 mo for depression. He was admitted with a 2-w history of fever chills and fatigue and on admission had hand tremors which disappeared at rest. Four days post-admission the trazodone dose was increased to 100 mg and 20 mg fluoxetine was initiated. He became increasingly anxious and his hand tremor worsened 3 d after initiation of the regimen. To rule out drug induced tremor, both trazodone and fluoxetine were discontinued and symptoms resolved in 7 d. Clinicians should be aware of the potential for excessive seratonergic activities secondary to trazodone + fluoxetine interactions causing a worsening myoclonus adverse event.

Abstract: A case of urinary retention emerging after fluoxetine (20 mg/day) addition to low risperidone doses (2 mg/day) is presented. Severe extrapyramidal side-effects (EPS) also occurred after fluoxetine-risperidone combination. Several possibilities, based on the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties of risperidone and fluoxetine, which merit consideration in an attempt to explain our patient's side-effects, are discussed. Extrapyramidal side-effects can be due to an increase of the plasma concentration of risperidone and/or the intrinsic propensity of fluoxetine to produce EPS. Urinary retention may be the consequence of a central serotoninergic mechanism in, or without, combination central D2 blockade.

Abstract: A frontal lobe syndrome has previously been reported in adults treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), but not in children. Five typical cases of apathy and lack of motivation, one accompanied by disinhibition, are described in a child and four adolescents. Symptoms were dose related and reversible. The subtlety of symptoms, lack of insight in patients, disabling effects, and delayed onset indicate a need for clinicians to inform families of these potential symptoms when SSRIs are prescribed.

Abstract: To describe HIV-infected individuals taking antidepressants who developed the serotonin syndrome due to drug--drug or drug--food interactions.
Case studies carried out at the HIV Outpatient Clinic, Atlanta Veterans Affairs Medical Center.
HIV-positive patients who were receiving antiretroviral and antidepressant therapies and presented with symptoms consistent with the serotonin syndrome. Their antidepressants were discontinued or the doses reduced in order to resolve the symptoms.
Five cases of serotonin syndrome developed after patients who were taking antidepressants ingested P450 inhibitors.
Serotonin syndrome should be suspected in patients on serotonergic medications who present with mental status change, autonomic dysfunction, and neuromuscular abnormalities. Suspicion should be heightened in those who are ingesting substances known to inhibit P450 enzymes, such as protease inhibitors, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and grapefruit juice.

Abstract: Male breast cancer is a rare condition with very poorly understood risk factors. We report three cases of men with malignant and pre-malignant breast disease who had all been prescribed selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for depression. Concerns about an association between this group of drugs and breast cancer in women have been previously raised and experimental evidence has suggested that these drugs could influence regulation of cellular proliferation acting through internal cellular messengers. Risk factors for the development of breast cancer are likely to be multifactorial, possibly more so in women given the complex physiological changes that occur in the female breast. Whilst the cases we report are anecdotal and other risk factors may be present, we suggest that assessment of any possible contribution that SSRI therapy may make to the development of breast neoplasia may be more easily assessed in a male population.

Abstract: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are a new group of antidepressants used in mild to moderate cases of depression. In studies evaluating the safety of SSRIs during pregnancy, no increase in major anomalies has been reported. This might have led to increasing off-label prescription of SSRIs to pregnant women. Neonatal withdrawal syndrome commonly occurs in infants exposed during the third trimester to drugs known to cause addiction. We report five cases of neonatal withdrawal syndrome after third trimester in utero SSRI exposure. In three cases the mother used paroxetine in doses from 10 to 40 mg, one mother used citalopram 30 mg, and one mother fluoxetine 20 mg. Withdrawal symptoms occurred within few days after birth and lasted up to one month after birth. Four of the infants needed treatment with chlorpromazine. Symptoms were irritability, constant crying, shivering, increased tonus, eating and sleeping difficulties and convulsions.
Neonatal withdrawal syndrome can occur after third trimester in utero SSRI exposure. Further research should focus on whether it is safe to use SSRIs during the last trimester. All neonates exposed to SSRIs during the last trimester should be followed-up closely for withdrawal symptoms after birth.

Abstract: There is considerable comorbidity of major depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and antidepressants have been reported to be effective in treating PTSD. Addition of triiodothyronine (T3) to ongoing antidepressant treatment is considered an effective augmentation strategy in refractory depression. We report the effect of T3 augmentation of antidepressants in patients with PTSD.
T3 (25 microg/day) was added to treatment with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) (paroxetine or fluoxetine, 20 mg/day for at least 4 weeks and 40 mg/day for a further 4 weeks) of 5 patients who fulfilled DSM-IV criteria for PTSD but not for major depressive disorder (although all patients had significant depressive symptoms). The Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale, the 21-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, and the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness scale were administered every 2 weeks, and self-assessments were performed with a 100 mm visual analog mood scale.
In 4 of the 5 patients, partial clinical improvement was observed with SSRI treatment at a daily dose of 20 mg with little further improvement when the dose was raised to 40 mg/day. This improvement was substantially enhanced by the addition of T3. Improvement was most striking on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression.
T3 augmentation of SSRI treatment may be of therapeutic benefit in patients with PTSD, particularly those with depressive symptoms. Larger samples and controlled studies are needed in order to confirm this observation.

Abstract: A continuing challenge in the treatment of depression is how to determine whether an effective drug has been selected for a particular patient, given that individuals will respond to some antidepressants but not others. The factors that contribute to response for each person have been examined from a variety of perspectives, both psychological and physiological. Advances in neuroimaging and in quantitative electroencephalography (QEEG) have made it possible to examine features of brain activity that are associated with response. A new QEEG measure, cordance, is correlated with regional cortical perfusion, and has been used with retrospective and prospective studies to evaluate specific findings that are predictive of clinical response in major depression. We present here a series of depressed subjects treated with antidepressants of different classes; decreases in prefrontal activity were seen as early as 48 hours into treatment in responders and were absent in nonresponders. These findings suggest a role for the prefrontal region in mediating response to medications with different mechanisms of action and raise the possibility of using new QEEG measures to identify changes in brain activity that are predictive of clinical outcome from antidepressant treatment.

Abstract: Hyponatremia secondary to the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) is an uncommon complication of treatment with the new class of antidepressant agents, the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Most of the reported cases were associated with fluoxetine; only 2 have previously been described in association with citalopram. We describe an elderly woman who presented with severe symptomatic hyponatremia caused by the SIADH during therapy with citalopram. Because the use of SSRIs is becoming more popular among elderly depressed patients, the present case and the other 2 reported previously emphasize the need for greater awareness of the development of this serious and potentially fatal complication also in association with citalopram therapy and suggest that serum sodium levels should be monitored closely in elderly patients during treatment with citalopram.

Abstract: Fluoxetine, an antidepressant of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor class, may stimulate prolactin release by pituitary lactotrophs. A 71-year-old woman taking estrogen replacement therapy developed galactorrhea after initiation of fluoxetine for depression and was found to have an elevated prolactin level. Fluoxetine was discontinued with resolution of the patient's galactorrhea and normalization of her prolactin level.

Abstract: Substance abuse is a common comorbid illness in patients with mood disorders. Little has been written about the pharmacologic treatment of patients with affective lability and co-occurring substance abuse, however. The following report will describe clinical experience using divalproex sodium in substance-abusing patients with mood disorder.
Twenty patients admitted to an intermediate-care inpatient substance abuse program were diagnosed with comorbid mood disorder (according to DSM-IV criteria) and treated with divalproex sodium in an open-label, naturalistic trial with no blind. All patients were followed clinically and were assessed using the Clinical Global Impressions scale (CGI) and laboratory studies.
Seven patients referred while on divalproex treatment continued to exhibit improved mood. Eleven others had at least 1 week of follow-up, and 10 of these also showed improvement. In 13 cases, divalproex was used safely with other psychiatric medications. Two patients complained of slight tremor, 1 of whom was also taking fluoxetine. Fifteen of 17 patients in whom biochemistry and hematology laboratory studies were completed had unremarkable results; 2 other patients had pretreatment abnormalities, which worsened over the course of treatment. Mean plasma valproate level was 58.53 microg/mL. Mean length of follow-up was 38 days. Mean period of abstinence prior to starting medication was 48 days. Some patients reported decreased cravings, and, by self-report, all patients remained abstinent.
This report suggests that divalproex sodium is efficacious and safe, both alone and in combination with other psychiatric medications, in treating substance-abusing patients with mood disorder.

Abstract: Recent reports suggest the possible efficacy of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in treating particular symptoms of Huntington's disease (HD), such as aggressiveness and agitation. However, predictive features to identify HD subjects who may benefit from this treatment have not been established.
Two individuals from a large HD pedigree with a very high prevalence of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) have been treated with fluoxetine, an SSRI. We aimed at testing whether the co-occurrence of the two disorders in this pedigree might have some underlying pathogenic similarities, maybe also resulting in a good response of HD symptoms to the anti-obsessional drug fluoxetine.
Each patient was evaluated, started on fluoxetine treatment, and then reassessed monthly with: (a) the HD motor rating scale, to rate the impairment of movement, and (b) the mini mental state examination, for a cognitive ascertainment. They had a complete psychiatric and neurologic examination as well.
Both subjects showed an excellent response to fluoxetine. One patient exhibited improvement of the motor and behavioral components of the disorder, while the other improved also in the cognitive domain of HD. The best response was shown by the individual suffering from OCD in her youth. The amelioration in these two patients has been maintained for 2 and 6 years, respectively, whereas the course of HD is that of a progressive deterioration.
Firm conclusions to explain these results cannot be drawn. However, a hypothetical involvement of the serotonergic system, suggested by the excess of OCD in the pedigree, seems supported by the response of these two individuals to fluoxetine. It may be worth further exploring the value of the psychiatric picture in selecting the appropriate treatment for at least some cases of HD.

Abstract: Psychotropic Drugs and ST Segment Elevation. Transient ST segment elevation in right precordial leads with use of psychotropic drugs is reported in two cases of overdose and one case of therapeutic administration. Flecainide did not reproduce ST segment elevation. The relationship of these abnormalities to the Brugada syndrome and the electrophysiologic hypothesis are discussed.

Abstract: To report a case of treatment of bipolar depression and management of antidepressant-induced mania with a low-dose fluoxetine regimen.
A 59-year-old white woman was admitted involuntarily to a New York State psychiatric center with a diagnosis of bipolar (type I) disorder, mixed, with psychotic features. Initial treatment with lithium, olanzapine, and clonazepam produced a remission of manic and psychotic symptoms. However, the patient remained clinically depressed. Addition of oral fluoxetine 10 mg every morning to her medication regimen was followed 22 days later by the development of a manic state. Reduction of the fluoxetine dosage to 10 mg twice weekly was associated with the attainment of euthymia in 18 days. Thirteen days after the fluoxetine dosage reduction, the patient's fluoxetine blood concentration was 20 micrograms/L and the norfluoxetine concentration was reported as 53 micrograms/L.
To our knowledge, this is the first published case that describes the association between a low-dose fluoxetine regimen and the evolution of a bipolar affective state from depression to euthymia via manic switching. The temporal synchrony of this switching with initial implementation of fluoxetine 10 mg every morning, followed by a dose reduction to 10 mg twice weekly, suggests that bipolar depressed patients are extremely sensitive to low doses of antidepressants and to incremental changes in these doses. However, it also suggests that they can respond clinically to such treatment. Furthermore, our laboratory data indicate that antidepressant blood concentrations may play a contributory role in maintaining the balance between euthymia and mania in these patients.
Manic switching is always a concern when treating a bipolar depressed patient. Utilization of a low-dose antidepressant drug regimen may be a clinically prudent approach in such an individual.

Abstract: Hoarding behavior associated with focal brain injury is rarely reported. The authors report a 46-year-old man with pathologic collecting behavior after a left orbitofrontal and caudate injury from an aneurysmal rupture of anterior communicating artery. His hoarding, an impulse control disorder or an ego-syntonic compulsion, was restricted to one specific item (toy bullet). Treatments with sertraline or fluoxetine were not effective for the hoarding.

Abstract: We report positron emission tomographic measurements of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in a male patient with war and torture related post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) during symptom provocation. The subject was exposed to war related sounds before and after treatment with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI; Fluoxetine; Fontex((R))). Therapy reduced PTSD symptoms, provoked anxiety and heart rate. Before treatment trauma reminders resulted in decreased rCBF in the insula, prefrontal, and inferior frontal cortices. Increased activity was evident in the cerebellum, precuneus and supplementary motor cortex. This was normalized after SSRI administration. Prefrontal and cingulate rCBF correlated with heart rate. Hence, the anxiolytic effect of SSRI for PTSD could be mediated by prefrontal and paralimbic cortices. Data suggest that SSRI treatment normalize provocation induced rCBF alterations in areas involved in memory, emotion, attention and motor-control.

Abstract: We describe a preterm infant with marked motor automatism and skin manifestations after being exposed to fluoxetine in utero. The fluoxetine level drawn at 96 hours of age was 92 ng/ml, which was in adult therapeutic range. The neurologic symptoms resolved by 7 days and follow-up at 4 months revealed normal neurodevelopmental examination.

Abstract: We describe an open trial of psychostimulants (primarily methylphenidate sustained release [SR]) added to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs; primarily fluoxetine) during the course of pharmacologic treatment of men with paraphilias and paraphilia-related disorders (PRDs).
Twenty-six men with paraphilias (N = 14) or PRDs (N = 12) were assessed for life-time mood disorders and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) as defined by DSM-IV. All men were assessed at baseline for total sexual outlet and average time per day associated with paraphilia/PRD sexual behaviors. The indications for the addition of a psychostimulant to a stable dose of SSRI included the retrospective diagnosis of ADHD with persistent adult symptoms despite pharmacotherapy with an SSRI (N = 17); residual paraphilia/PRD fantasies, urges, and activities despite SSRI pharmacotherapy (N = 16); the persistence or presence of residual depressive symptoms despite SSRI pharmacotherapy (N = 6); relapse or loss of SSRI efficacy during the treatment of sexual impulsivity disorders (N = 4); and treatment of SSRI-induced side effects (N = 4).
SSRI pharmacotherapy (mean +/- SD duration = 8.8+/-11.1 months) had statistically significant effects in diminishing paraphilia/PRD-related total sexual outlet (p < .001) and average time/day spent in paraphilia/PRD sexual behavior (p < .001). Addition of methylphenidate SR (mean dose = 40 mg/day; mean +/- SD duration = 9.6+/-8.2 months) was associated with additional statistically significant effects on paraphilia/PRD-related total sexual outlet (p = .003) and average time per day (p = .04) in addition to improvement of putative residual ADHD and depressive symptoms.
Methylphenidate SR can be cautiously and effectively combined with SSRI antidepressants to ameliorate paraphilias and paraphilia-related disorders for the indications listed above.

Abstract: Auditory sensitivity and processing ability were evaluated in a patient who suffered from hyperacusis, difficulty understanding speech, withdrawn depression, lethargy, and hypersensitivity to touch, pressure, and light. Treatment with fluvoxamine and fluoxetine (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) reversibly alleviated complaints. Testing while medicated and unmedicated (after voluntary withdrawal from medication for several weeks) revealed no difference in pure-tone thresholds, speech thresholds, word recognition scores, tympanograms, or acoustic reflex thresholds. Medicated SCAN-A (a screening test for central auditory processing disorders) results were normal, and unmedicated results were abnormal. Unmedicated transient otoacoustic emissions and auditory brainstem response waves I, III, and V were significantly larger bilaterally. Uncomfortable loudness levels indicated greater tolerance during the medicated condition. Central processing and vigilance were evaluated with analog-synthesized three-formant consonant-vowel syllables. While medicated, responses to stimuli at each ear revealed well-defined, labeling crossovers of about 90 msec. Vowel identification matched normal subject responses; labeling of /gE/jE/ and /bE/wE/ continua was well defined but all crossover points differed from normals (p < .0001). During unmedicated testing, responses to /gE/jE/ began at medicated levels but approached chance levels for the entire continuum within 10 min; labeling of /bE/wE/ was consistent with medicated responses throughout with earlier than normal crossover points.

Abstract: Hypochondriasis is a heterogeneous disorder. This was well demonstrated in the study by Kellner et al, which showed that patients with high levels of disease fear tended to be more anxious or phobic, whereas patients with high levels of disease conviction tended to have more and more severe somatic symptoms. Little comorbidity exists to support the statement that hypochondriasis is an obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorder. Although patients exist whose hypochondriac concerns are identical in quality to the intrusive thoughts of patients with OCD, as a group, patients with hypochondriasis do not share a comorbidity profile comparable with that of patients with OCD. The data support a closer relationship between hypochondriasis and somatization disorder than between hypochondriasis and OCD. The family history data is limited by the lack of adequate studies. Using comparable methods of the family history approach, Black's study reported a higher frequency of GAD but not OCD among the relatives of OCD patients--a finding similar to what Noyes found among the relatives of hypochondriac patients; however, using the direct interview method, somatization disorder was the only statistically more common disorder, among relatives of female hypochondriac patients. Therefore, although the parallel in overlap with GAD is suggestive of a commonality between OCD, GAD, and hypochondriasis, the finding of a greater frequency of somatization disorder leans against the hypothesis that hypochondriasis is best considered an OCD spectrum disorder. The pharmacologic treatment data are the one type of biologic evidence that supports a bridge to OCD. The pharmacologic studies suggest that for patients with general hypochondriasis, TCAs are not effective and that higher dosages and longer trials of the SRIs are needed. These pharmacologic observations are comparable with the ones made for patients with OCD but dissimilar to the observations made for depression. The benefit of imipramine among patients with illness phobia must be assessed in placebo-controlled trials among illness phobics and among hypochondriacs. Even more valuable would be a direct comparison of a TCA (e.g., imipramine or desipramine) and a selective SRI (e.g., fluoxetine) to determine whether the response to selective SRIs is greater. Although the pharmacologic data are compelling in supporting the hypothesis that hypochondriasis is an obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorder, the comorbidity data are equally compelling in dispelling that hypothesis. Perhaps future studies clarify the subtypes of hypochondriasis, be they "phobic, obsessive, and depressive," "chronic and episodic," "early onset versus late onset" or some other as yet undetermined subtype. Such clarification may be aided by better instruments to assess the obsessive-compulsive and hypochondria spectrums within individuals and families and by neuropsychological or pharmacologic challenge and neuroimaging studies.

Abstract: The concomitant use of olanzapine and fluoxetine has been advocated for the treatment of various psychiatric disease states. We describe a case in which the combination of olanzapine and fluoxetine appears to have caused the psychopathology of melancholic depression requiring hospitalization in a 40-year-old female. Postulated mechanisms for this drug interaction, particularly CYP450 isoenzyme inhibition by fluoxetine, is discussed.

Abstract: To report the development of a possible serotonin syndrome in a patient taking buspirone and fluoxetine.
A 37-year-old white man taking fluoxetine 20 mg/d for generalized anxiety disorder developed confusion, diaphoresis, incoordination, diarrhea, and myoclonus after buspirone was added to the drug regimen.
Serotonin syndrome is a potentially lethal condition of serotonin hyperstimulation, which may develop rapidly or over the course of several weeks. Symptoms of serotonin syndrome typically occur following additions or increases of serotonin-enhancing drugs. Although buspirone has variable effects on post- and presynaptic 5-HT1A receptors that may reduce the risk of serotonin syndrome when administered as a single agent, it may cause an adverse reaction when given with other serotonergic drugs.
Symptoms consistent with serotonin syndrome may develop with the concurrent administration of buspirone and fluoxetine.

Abstract: Black hairy tongue is characterized by an abnormal coating of the dorsal surface of the tongue. Although the cause is unknown, several precipitating factors may be implicated in the pathogenesis of this disorder. A case is presented in which black hairy tongue appeared subsequent to the administration of fluoxetine hydrochloride, thiothixene hydrochloride, benztropine mesylate, and clonazepam for bipolar affective disorder.

Abstract: Trazodone is a popular antidepressant medication that has been available for approximately 30 years. It has a reputation as a safe drug with relatively few reported fatalities attributed solely to it. We review the pharmacology and forensic toxicology of trazodone and report toxicology and cause and manner of death in a series of 37 deaths in which trazodone was detected. Although the normal upper therapeutic blood concentration for trazodone is about 2 mg/L, fatalities are rarely attributed solely to it at blood concentrations below 9 mg/L. Considering the pharmacology of the drug, potential interactions between other drugs with serotonin reuptake properties need to be considered, as does the increased susceptibility to the toxic effects in patients with pre-existing heart disease. In the cases reviewed, none were attributed solely to trazodone, although trazodone was frequently present together with other serotonergic drugs, such as the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors like fluoxetine and sertraline. Ten cases had blood trazodone concentrations above 2 mg/L. Of these cases, trazodone played a primary role in the death of three subjects, with blood concentrations all greater than 9 mg/L. We confirm the conclusions of others that trazodone is a relatively safe drug except in massive overdose, although its toxicity may be influenced by the presence of other drugs and underlying pathophysiology.

Abstract: We studied a 67-year-old woman with a sporadic form of hyperekplexia, who experienced 8-10 excessive startle responses to unexpected stimuli per month. Therapy with fluoxetine had a definite beneficial effect. This finding supports the hypothesis that serotonergic mechanisms play a role in this disorder.

Abstract: We report the case of a patient who was treated with fluoxetine hydrochloride (Prozac) for depression. Approximately 8 weeks into the treatment, an eosinophilic pleural effusion and serum eosinophilia developed. An extensive workup for the etiology of eosinophilic pleural effusion was unrevealing. Pleural biopsy showed a nonspecific inflammatory reaction and mild fibrosis. The pleural effusion and eosinophilia resolved within a few weeks of cessation of the drug. Fluoxetine can be associated with pleural and serum eosinophilia, possibly through an allergic-mediated reaction.

Abstract: To characterise the skeletal muscle changes in the neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS).
Detailed light and ultrastructural examination was carried out on skeletal muscle from three cases of NMS, two associated with recreational drugs (3,4-methlenedioxymethylamphetamine (MDMA, Ecstasy) and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD)) and one with antipsychotic drugs (fluoxetine (Prozac) and remoxipride hydrochloride monohydrate (Roxiam)).
The muscles were grossly swollen and oedematous in all cases, in one with such severe local involvement that the diagnosis of sarcoma was considered. On microscopy, there was conspicuous oedema. In some fascicles less than 10% of fibres were affected whereas in others more than 50% were pale and enlarged. There was a spectrum of changes: tiny to large vacuoles replaced most of the sarcoplasm and were associated with necrosis. A striking feature in some fibres was the presence of contraction bands separating segments of oedematous myofibrils. Severe endomysial oedema was also detectable. There was a scanty mononuclear infiltrate but no evidence of regeneration.
The muscle changes associated with NMS are characteristic and may be helpful in differential diagnosis.

Abstract: Non-specific noradrenaline reuptake inhibition by high dose selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, along with catecholamine release from phaeochromocytoma, may lead to a hypertensive paroxysm. This may unmask a clinically silent phaeochromocytoma. Hypertensive paroxysm induced by paroxetine leading to detection of phaeochromocytoma has been reported. The first patient in whom fluoxetine unmasked a phaeochromocytoma is reported.

Abstract: The clinical course of a 9-year-old diagnosed with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and Tourette's disorder and treated with a combination of methylphenidate, clonidine, and fluoxetine is described. The patient experienced over a 10-month period, signs and symptoms suggestive of metabolic toxicity marked by bouts of gastrointestinal distress, low-grade fever, incoordination, and disorientation. Generalized seizures were observed, and the patient lapsed into status epilepticus followed by cardiac arrest and subsequently expired. At autopsy, blood, brain, and other tissue concentrations of fluoxetine and norfluoxetine were several-fold higher than expected based on literature reports for overdose situations. The medical examiner's report indicated death caused by fluoxetine toxicity. As the child's adoptive parents controlled medication access, they were investigated by social welfare agencies. Further genetic testing of autopsy tissue revealed the presence of a gene defect at the cytochrome P450 CYP2D locus, which results in poor metabolism of fluoxetine. As a result of this and other evidence, the investigation of the adoptive parents was terminated. This is the first report of a fluoxetine-related death in a child with a confirmed genetic polymorphism of the CYP2D6 gene that results in impaired drug metabolism. Issues relevant to child and adolescent psychopharmacology arising from this case are discussed.

Abstract: A 14-year-old female presented with the complaints of loss of hair, scalp pruritus, and pain in the abdomen. On careful work-up, she was found to have trichotillomania as well as trichophagia. Investigations also revealed a trichobezoar which completely filled the stomach. Hemogram showed moderate hypochromic anemia. Her detailed psychiatric profile showed a few additional features like obsessive hand washing, knuckle cracking, nose picking and body rocking. Her trichobezoar was removed surgically, and she had an uneventful post-operative recovery. She is being maintained on fluoxetine and is doing well. The role of a multi-disciplinary approach to trichotillomania patients is highlighted.

Abstract: The underlying neurochemical basis of social phobia has yet to be fully explained, but there are suggestions of serotonergic and dopaminergic dysfunction. The atypical neuroleptic clozapine has been reported to induce anxiety symptoms, probably owing to its effect on serotonergic pathways. We report 12 cases of schizophrenic patients who developed social phobia during clozapine treatment.
Patients were assessed using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R, Patient Version, Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms, Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms, the Liebowitz Social Phobia Scale, and the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale. They were reevaluated after 12 weeks of cotreatment with clozapine and fluoxetine.
In 8 of the 12 cases, symptoms responded (> or = 35% reduction in Liebowitz Social Phobia Scale score) with an adjunctive regimen of fluoxetine.
Data are discussed in light of neurochemical mechanisms and cognitive adaptations that could explain the onset of anxiety spectrum disorders (such as social phobia) in clozapine-treated schizophrenic subjects during remission of psychotic symptoms.

Abstract: Hyponatremia secondary to the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antiduretic hormone (SIADH) is an uncommon complication of treatment with the antidepressants the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). These effective anti-depressant agents are becoming widely used because of their favorable side effect profile and their safety in overdose. Although most reports have implicated fluoxetine in causing hyponatremia, there have also been a few reports of hyponatremia associated with paroxetine. We describe an elderly patient with severe life-threatening hyponatremia in association with paroxetine therapy. The present case and the others previously reported emphasize the need for greater awareness of the development of this serious and potentially fatal complication, and suggest that serum sodium concentration should be measured periodically in elderly patients soon after they start taking any agent of the SSRIs, especially during the first 2 to 4 weeks of treatment.

Abstract: This paper reviews the literature on selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor discontinuation symptoms. These symptoms have been well described in numerous anecdotal case reports and reports of small series of cases in the Caucasian population. There are no reports in the literature of it occurring in Asian patients. A study involving 65 patients on this type of antidepressant revealed that Asian patients do experience these withdrawal symptoms as well. Seven patients (3 on fluoxetine, 4 on fluvoxamine) reported symptoms similar to those reported by Caucasian patients in the literature. Three of the cases are reported in detail to highlight the clinical presentation in such cases.

Abstract: We present a 7-year-old boy with a developmental disorder presenting with severe head banging. Clinical evolution was consistent with diagnosis of autistic spectrum disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, stuttering, and Tourette's syndrome. This report emphasizes the overlap between developmental disorder phenotypes. There is a need to understand the natural history and relationship of specific symptoms that occur in developmental disorders to devise effective and appropriate intervention strategies.

Abstract: With the clinical availability of fluoxetine in the United States, we were interested in documenting improvements in the clinical care of dysthymic patients beyond what was reported from our clinic 2 decades earlier during the "tricyclic (TCA) era."
In open treatment of 42 consecutive DSM-III-R primary dysthymic patients who were personally followed up in our mood clinic since 1988, response was defined as sustained remission, i.e., no longer meeting criteria for dysthymia and achieving DSM-III-R Axis V Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) score > 70 throughout much of the mean follow-up of 5 years.
Compared to patients with nondysthymic episodic major depressive disorder (N = 42), dysthymic patients had a significantly earlier mean age at onset (12.6 vs. 34 years), were more likely to have never been married, had a greater frequency of superimposed major depressive episodes (except for the 14% [N = 6] with "pure" dysthymia), and had more psychiatric and fewer medical comorbidities; furthermore, patients with dysthymia had significantly greater familial loading of both unipolar and bipolar disorders. Continued treatment with TCA-type antidepressants or fluoxetine (including various augmenting strategies) led to an overall robust and sustained response rate of 76% (N = 32) among dysthymic patients; in tandem, major depressive episodes and suicidality were prevented in all responders. Females treated with fluoxetine had the highest response rate (85% [N = 17]); some were able to walk out of dependent abusive relationships for the first time in their lives. However, dramatic responses with "hyperthymic" switches in temperament occurred in only 12% of dysthymic patients; nearly all were males with bipolar family history. The more prototypic positive change among dysthymic responders consisted of coping with daily hassles without being overwhelmed. Qualitatively, the highest level of adaptive functioning was observed among fluoxetine-treated dysthymics (50% of responders [N = 12] achieved DSM-III-R GAF score of 81-90). Of TCA-treated patients, 39% had intolerable side effects, necessitating switch-over to fluoxetine. Agitation occurred in 11% of fluoxetine-treated patients (N = 4) and was associated with nonresponse and/or dropout; otherwise, this selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor was well tolerated, thereby contributing to long-term compliance. More provocatively, patients with dysthymia who had required extensive psychotherapeutic attention prior to state-of-the-art pharmacotherapy no longer required such therapy.
These data extend and enrich what has been learned from controlled trials among dysthymic patients. With sustained pharmacotherapy and specialized clinical care in a private mood clinic, 3 of 4 patients immersed in gloom for much of their lives achieved for the first time good to superior levels of functioning that were maintained for an average of 5 years. Although the art of clinical management of dysthymia should be fully grounded in understanding the interpersonal context of depression, we submit that SSRIs such as fluoxetine appear broadly efficacious in areas previously deemed to be the domain of formal psychotherapy.

Abstract: A case is presented of painful priapism of the clitoris lasting 3 days, with a strong temporal association with the administration of nefazodone hydrochloride. Priapism has been described as a rare side-effect of drugs with high alpha1-adrenergic blocking potential. However, the alpha1-adrenergic blocking potential of nefazodone is moderate. Drug-induced clitoral priapism has been described for citalopram, bromocriptine, fluoxetine and trazodone combined with fluoxetine. To our knowledge, this is the first report in the literature about priapism of the clitoris associated with nefazodone.

Abstract: Four children, ages 5 1/2 to 7 years, diagnosed with selective mutism and successfully treated with phenelzine are presented. All four children were anxious and extremely shy and had family histories of anxiety and shyness. The first three children were treated with phenelzine prior to reports that fluoxetine was helpful in some cases. The fourth child was treated initially with fluoxetine and had shown only minimal improvement after 10 months of doses up to 16 mg daily. Phenelzine doses ranged from 30 to 60 mg/day and treatment, including medication taper, lasted from 24 to 60 weeks. The phenelzine was generally well-tolerated and weight gain was the most common side effect. No hypertensive reactions or serotonin syndromes occurred. There was no recurrence of mutism after medication discontinuation. The authors conclude that phenelzine can be an effective treatment for selective mutism, but because of the possibility of serious food and drug interactions and the necessary dietary restrictions, it should be reserved for cases that do not respond to behavior therapy and fluoxetine or other specific serotonin reuptake inhibitors.

Abstract: One of the predictive factors of treatment-resistant depression is the syndrome of relative insulin resistance, i.e. adipositas, mild hypertension and a family history of type-2 diabetes. Such a case is here reported with a good outcome to anti-stress medication, including ketoconazole and lithium.

Abstract: Bulimia nervosa and alcohol use disorders frequently co-occur. A review of the literature, however, reveals a paucity of information on treatment of patients with these comorbid conditions. We present a case report of a 34-year-old Caucasian female with a 20-year history of bulimia nervosa with co-occurring alcohol dependence, who participated in a randomized placebo-controlled medication augmentation trial for bulimia nervosa. The patient served as a pilot subject who met the exclusionary criterion of alcohol dependence, but received all the assessment and intervention procedures of the clinical trial for bulimia nervosa. Despite double-blind random assignment to a placebo condition, the patient's symptoms of bulimia nervosa substantially improved over the course of the 5-week efficacy trial. We hypothesize that this improvement was due to concurrent abstinence from alcohol rather than a placebo effect.

Abstract: To describe the effect of the tricyclic drug clomipramine in a very old patient with obsessive-compulsive disorder and Alzheimer dementia.
A 93-year-old woman had a history of obsessive-compulsive disorder since early adulthood. The obsession consisted of remembering names of famous people and the compulsion consisted of excessive list making. With the onset of memory loss secondary to Alzheimer disease, she became increasingly anxious and compulsive as a result of a failure to remember. After nine weeks on fluoxetine she became jittery and more confused. After a two-week wash-out period, she was given a nine-week course of clomipramine that was carefully titrated up to a therapeutic concentration.
At the completion of clomipramine treatment, the patient no longer felt driven to recall the names of famous people. Her score from the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale dropped from 29 to 3. Her Folstein Mini-Mental State Examination score increased from 21 to 23.
Clomipramine appeared much more effective and better tolerated than fluoxetine in this very old patient despite its potential anticholinergic effect and the coexistence of Alzheimer disease.

Abstract: To review the literature describing female orgasmic disorder and impaired sexual desire disorder by selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and their treatment, including the use of sildenafil.
Literature reviews of all available published articles on this topic from 1989 to 1996 were done. This paper also includes a sample case of a 38-year old woman who suffers from fluoxetine-induced arousal and orgasmic disturbance.
Treatment approaches include the use of "antidotes," such as cyproheptadine, yohimbine, amantadine, granisetron and ginkgo biloba. This article also reports a case of successful female use of sildenafil, which was released by the Food and Drug Administration in March 1998 for erectile dysfunction in men.
Sildenafil is beneficial in reversing female sexual dysfunction induced by SSRIs. This paper also discusses sildenafil's action in the background of nitric oxide and cyclic guaninosine monophosphate in penile/clitoral erection.

Abstract: Fluoxetine and its active metabolite norfluoxetine have long half-lives of 4-6 days and 4-16 days, respectively. We postulated that, owing to the long elimination half-life, patients diagnosed with panic disorder might be maintained on fluoxetine taken once a week, after being treated initially with daily doses of fluoxetine.
Ten patients with DSM-III-R panic disorder were treated openly with fluoxetine, 20-40 mg daily. Once panic free, these patients were switched to once-weekly dosing of fluoxetine, and dosage was titrated as needed.
All 10 patients successfully switched to once-weekly dosing. One patient reported recurrence of panic attacks 18 months after the switch. After a brief treatment for 4 weeks with benzodiazepines and daily fluoxetine, the patient was once again maintained on once-weekly dosing when rechallenged. Patients have been maintained in a panic-free state for up to 26 months with a single weekly dose of fluoxetine ranging from 10 to 60 mg. The medication was well tolerated.
Fluoxetine at doses ranging from 10 to 60 mg administered once weekly appears to be effective maintenance treatment for patients with panic disorder who were initially treated successfully with daily fluoxetine. A once-weekly regimen may allow for considerable cost savings and may serve as a convenient alternative method for treating panic disorder.

Abstract: Open-label addition of a low-dose typical (pimozide) neuroleptic was shown to be beneficial in some patients with serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI)-refractory trichotillomania (TTM). Risperidone's potentially more benign acute and long-term side effect profile makes it a candidate for investigation in the treatment of TTM. We report our experience with the systematic addition of open-label risperidone 0.5 to 3 mg/day in three patients with SRI-refractory TTM. All three patients had a robust decrease in hair pulling as measured by clinician-rated instruments. These results suggest that risperidone addition to ongoing treatment with SRIs may be an effective treatment strategy for patients with SRI-refractory TTM.

Abstract: At low doses, risperidone acts as a 5-HT2 antagonist. Preclinical data suggest 5-HT2 antagonists may enhance the action of serotonin. This report examines the clinical use of risperidone to augment selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) anti-depressants in patients who have not responded to SSRI therapy.
In 8 patients with major depressive disorder without psychotic features (DSM-IV) who had not responded to an SSRI, risperidone was added to the ongoing SSRI treatment. Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression scores were obtained before and after the addition of risperidone.
These 8 patients remitted within 1 week of the addition of risperidone. Risperidone also appeared to have beneficial effects on sleep disturbance and sexual dysfunction.
Risperidone may be a useful adjunct to SSRIs in the treatment of depression.

Abstract: We report on a 15-year-old compound heterozygous young woman with fragile X syndrome who has a full mutation of 363 repeats on one X chromosome and a premutation of 103 repeats on the other X chromosome. As predicted, subsequent testing demonstrated that her father carries a premutation (98 repeats) as does her mother (146 repeats). There is only one previous report of a compound heterozygous female with fragile X syndrome. By quantitation of Southern blot signals, the activation ratio for the premutation (the proportion of the premutation on the active X chromosome) was determined to be 0.78. Immunocytochemistry of blood smears showed fragile X mental retardation-1 protein (FMRP) expression in 63.5% of lymphocytes. Cognitively, this woman is functioning in the mid-range of involvement for fragile X females. She attends regular classes and receives supplemental assistance for her learning disabilities. She experiences behavior characteristics typical of females with fragile X syndrome including severe shyness, anxiety, panic episodes, mood swings, and attention deficits. She has responded very well to appropriate treatment including fluoxetine for anxiety, methylphenidate for attentional problems, and educational therapy.

Abstract: This is the first report that details an association between fragile X syndrome (FXS) and selective mutism (SM). This 12-year-old girl with heterozygous full mutation at FMR1 has a long history of social anxiety and shyness in addition to SM. Her sister also has the full mutation and a history of SM that resolved in adolescence. A beneficial response to fluoxetine and psychotherapy is described. The FMR1 mutation appears to be the first gene mutation associated with SM and further studies are recommended to assess what percentage of patients with SM have the FMR1 mutation.

Abstract: Patients with spinal cord injury (SCI) may develop depression. This may be related to adjustment to living with an SCI in addition to dealing with complications of the injury, such as spasticity. Pharmacologic treatment of depression can be difficult because of neurochemical and receptor changes that are associated with SCI. Newer antidepressant agents are purported to have selective activity by alteration of serotonergic neurotransmission. A case report is presented that illustrates exacerbation of spasticity by this family of antidepressant medications. Mechanisms possibly explaining this exacerbation of spasticity are the effects of serotonin on motor neuron and reflex activity, denervation supersensitivity, and the serotonin syndrome. Understanding the relationship between serotonergic systems and spasticity can be important in treating depression in patients with spasticity.

Abstract: Beta-CIT can be used as a tracer for SPECT to visualize serotonin transporters in the human brain. We present a case of bulimia nervosa and major depressive disorder, who had been treated with up to 60 mg/d fluoxetine for several weeks. Four hours after injection of the tracer more than 40% of serotonin transporters were blocked. To our knowledge, this is the first direct documentation of the pharmacodynamic action of fluoxetine in the human brain in vivo.

Abstract: Gynecomastia (breast enlargement) is a side effect of neuroleptic antipsychotic drugs, related to prolactin elevation caused by dopamine D2 receptor blockade (Richelson, 1996). The atypical antipsychotic risperidone is less likely to cause gynecomastia at low doses (Casey, 1996). It can cause a dose-dependent increase in serum prolactin concentration (Peuskens, 1995), by blocking dopamine D2 receptors (Richelson, 1996). I would like to describe a patient who did not have gynecomastia with risperidone at a dose of 3 mg/day, but had it when risperidone, at a dose of 0.5 mg/day, was combined with fluoxetine. A MEDLINE search failed to find any reports about such an interaction.

Abstract: Kleptomania is characterized by an irresistible impulse to steal objects not needed for personal use or for their monetary value. Several recent case reports have shown that Serotonin Specific Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) could be effective in the treatment of kleptomania just as it is in other obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorders. We report five cases of kleptomania patients who were successfully treated with fluoxetine or paroxetine in combination with a psychotherapeutic intervention. In one case, the discontinuation of the medication repeatedly led to the resurgence of the kleptomanic behavior. Our case series illustrates the effectiveness of SSRIs in kleptomania. It thus supports the assumption that this syndrome involves a dysfunctional serotoninergic mechanism.

Abstract: Recurrent brief depression (RBD) has a high prevalence in the general population (approximately 10%). At present, data on the treatment of RBD are sparse. Results of treatment studies with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (fluoxetine, paroxetine) did not demonstrate superiority of the active drug over placebo in RBD. We report about two patients with RBD treated with mirtazapine over a period of 4 months. Mirtazapine is a noradrenergic with specific selective serotoninergic antidepressant. Patients had to keep a diary in order to document psychopathological symptoms of major depression according to DSM-IV. We showed a marked reduction of severity, duration and frequency of brief depressive episodes in two patients with RBD treated with 30 mg mirtazapine over a period of 4 months. Mirtazapine enhances serotonergic as well as noradrenergic neurotransmission. This dual mechanism of action may be necessary to improve RBD. Consequently, mirtazapine might be a treatment option for patients with RBD. However, our preliminary observations need to be substantiated in controlled studies.

Abstract: Divalproex sodium, an anticonvulsant and antimanic agent, has recently been studied for its antiaggressive effects in patients with brain injuries, dementia, and borderline personality disorder. Since patients with other personality disorders also exhibit impulsive aggressive behavior, we conducted a preliminary open-label trial of divalproex sodium as a treatment for irritability and aggression in patients with a variety of personality disorders.
Ten patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for at least one personality disorder were treated with divalproex sodium in an 8-week open clinical trial. All patients had failed a trial of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). Divalproex sodium was increased as tolerated using a flexible dosing schedule. Clinician ratings for impulsive aggressive behavior and irritability were made every 2 weeks using the modified Overt Aggression Scale (OAS-M).
Six of 8 completers reported significant decreases in irritability (p = .003) and impulsive aggressive behavior (p = .019). For the entire sample, improvement on OAS-M irritability and overt aggression scores was noted by the end of 4 weeks and continued to occur through week 8.
This study suggests that divalproex sodium is an effective treatment for impulsive aggressive behavior in some patients with personality disorder who fail to respond to other antiaggressive agents (i.e., SSRIs). Controlled studies are needed to determine which patients are most likely to benefit from divalproex sodium and to evaluate the differential effectiveness of various agents in reducing impulsive aggressive behavior.

Abstract: Fear of flying is a common specific phobia usually treated with behavior therapy; the possibility of pharmacologic treatment has received very little study. The authors report two cases in which successful fluoxetine treatment of major depressive disorder unexpectedly and unintentionally resolved a concomitant fear of flying that had preceded the depressive disorder.

Abstract: Little is known about the psychiatric diagnosis and treatment of adolescents who sexually offend. We therefore describe an adolescent sex offender who met DSM-IV criteria for multiple paraphilias (except for the age criterion), bipolar type II disorder, and OCD, whose paraphilic urges and behaviors, depression, and violent obsessions responded to open label fluoxetine after failing to respond to long-term residential treatment. Although only a single and uncontrolled observation, this case suggests that some adolescent sex offenders may in fact have paraphilias, and that paraphilias in adolescents, like those in adults, may respond to serotonin reuptake inhibitors.

Abstract: Emotional incontinence (EI) is a perturbing condition characterized by uncontrollable outbursts of exaggerated, involuntary facial expressions and pathological crying or laughter. There is increasing evidence that serotonergic neurotransmission may be damaged in EI. The authors report 4 pathological crying cases (3 poststroke and 1 with multiple sclerosis) and 1 case of pathological laughter after traumatic brain injury. EI improved dramatically with three different selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (fluoxetine, sertraline, and paroxetine) in the context of these different CNS diseases.

Abstract: Use of the serotonin uptake antidepressants is growing. These agents are thought to be safer than the tricyclic antidepressants, but clinicians should be aware that with overdoses, seizure activity and cardiac dysrhythmias have been reported in the medical literature. Physicians should be prepared to recognize and manage these overdosages. An illustrative case and a review of the literature are presented.

Abstract: Paroxetine (Paxil) is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, one of a new class of antidepressants used in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder, and depression. Paroxetine potentiates serotonergic activity through the selective inhibition of serotonin reuptake in the central nervous system. There are few reported overdoses in the literature, and of these, three were fatal. Three coroner's cases in which paroxetine was directly associated with the cause of death are reported. In case #1, paroxetine was the only drug detected in significant concentrations. The heart blood paroxetine concentration was 4.0 mg/L. Case #2 was a known suicide in which the decedent herself admitted taking pills and alcohol. The hospital blood sample drawn at admission was analyzed and contained a 0.25% ethanol level and no paroxetine. Death occurred 10 h later. The postmortem heart blood contained ethanol at 0.06%, paroxetine at 3.7 mg/L, fluoxetine at 0.86 mg/L, and norfluoxetine at 0.65 mg/L. In case #3, death was attributed to an apparent adverse drug interaction between paroxetine and imipramine/desipramine. The postmortem heart blood contained paroxetine at 1.4 mg/L, imipramine at 3.0 mg/L, and desipramine at 9.6 mg/L.

Abstract: Emotionalism (emotional lability) is a common but distressing phenomenon that occurs frequently in individuals suffering cerebral vascular accidents and other brain diseases. Patients with emotionalism sometimes embarrass their families and themselves, becoming socially disabled despite normal physical function. At its worst, emotionalism interferes with rehabilitation programs, delays progress and sometimes makes these programs impossible. This paper reports the effect of fluoxetine in treating three patients with persistent emotionalism (2 cases following cerebrovascular accidents, 1 case following encephalitis). All 3 patients demonstrated dramatic improvement in emotionalism within 6 days of treatment. The severity, frequency and duration of each episode were reduced greatly. The treatment improved the effectiveness of the rehabilitation program, relieved patient and family embarrassment, and enabled patients to resume rapidly their previous lifestyle patterns. All patients reached the functional goals planned prior to the onset of rehabilitation. We conclude that fluoxetine is highly effective in treating the symptoms of emotionalism in all patients, and allows for recovery of both physical and social function.

Abstract: Although trichobezoars are well described in the surgical literature, there is relatively little in the psychiatric literature on them. This study aims to focus the attention of readers on trichobezoars by means of a case report and an overview of the literature.
We present a case of a patient with trichotillomania and a trichobezoar, including psychiatric management. We also briefly review the relevant literature.
Hair-pulling significantly improved in response to treatment with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine and supportive psychotherapy.
The medical and psychiatric sequelae of trichotillomania should not be underestimated. Pharmacotherapy may be play a useful role in some patients with this disorder.

Abstract: To analyze features of a series of fatalities caused by amphetamine-derivative designer drugs marketed as "Ecstasy" in South Australia, and to identify reasons for the recent marked increase in number of these deaths.
Following the death of a 26-year-old woman after alleged ingestion of Ecstasy tablets, a retrospective search of files at State Forensic Science, Adelaide and the South Australian State Coroner's Department was undertaken from February 1992 to January 1997 to identify similar cases.
Six fatalities were found, all of which have occurred since September 1995 (M:F ratio, 1:1; age range, 22 to 36 years; average age, 27.7 years). All individuals had histories of recent ingestion of illegal drugs thought to be Ecstasy (methylenedioxymethamphetamine, MDMA) at the time of purchase. Delay occurred in seeking medical attention, despite severe symptoms. Causes of death involved documented hyperthermia in 3 cases (temperatures of 41.5-46.1 degrees C), with features of hyperthermia in one other case, and intracranial hemorrhage in another. Drugs in toxic/lethal amounts identified at postmortem included paramethoxyamphetamine (PMA) in all cases, amphetamine/methamphetamine in 4 cases, and methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or Ecstasy) in only 2 cases. Interaction with a prescription medication (fluoxetine) may have occurred in 1 case.
The number of deaths due to amphetamine derivatives apparently due to substitution of PMA for MDMA (Ecstasy) have recently increased markedly in Adelaide. Potential users should be warned that PMA has been associated with a much higher rate of lethal complications than other designer drugs, and that no guarantee can be made that tablets sold as Ecstasy are not PMA.

Abstract: Thirty-seven children, aged between 2 and 7 years, with idiopathic autism underwent an open-label trial of fluoxetine treatment. All had assessment of diagnosis, developmental status, and family psychiatric history. Independent developmental testing before and after starting fluoxetine permitted quantification of language acquisition in a subgroup. Twenty-two of the 37 children had a beneficial treatment response sustained during continuing treatment for 13 to 33 months (mean 21 months). Eleven had an excellent response and were able to attend mainstream classrooms. Eleven had a good response though they remained identifiably autistic. Fifteen children had no benefit. Responders showed behavioral, language, cognitive, affective, and social improvements. Responders with adequate testing showed marked increases in language acquisition at every stage of development as compared with (1) pretreatment status, (2) responses to other treatments, (3) ability in non-language (matching) tasks, and (4) historical controls from the literature. The response to fluoxetine strongly correlated with a family history of major affective disorder. These preliminary findings implicate serotonergic mechanisms in autistic symptomatology and warrant further study with controlled trials.

Abstract: A case is presented of a fatal drug interaction caused by ingestion of clozapine (Clozaril) and fluoxetine (Prozac). Clozapine is a tricyclic dibenzodiazepine derivative used as an "atypical antipsychotic" in the treatment of severe paranoid schizophrenia. Fluoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor used for the treatment of major depression. Clinical studies have proven that concomitant administration of fluoxetine and clozapine produces increased plasma concentrations of clozapine and enhances clozapine's pharmacological effects due to suspected inhibition of clozapine metabolism by fluoxetine. Blood, gastric, and urine specimens were analyzed for fluoxetine by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and for clozapine by gas-liquid chromatography (GLC). Clozapine concentrations were: plasma, 4.9 micrograms/mL; gastric contents, 265 mg; and urine, 51.5 micrograms/mL. Fluoxetine concentrations were: blood, 0.7 microgram/mL; gastric contents, 3.7 mg; and urine 1.6 micrograms/mL. Norfluoxetine concentrations were: blood, 0.6 microgram/mL, and none detected in the gastric contents or urine. Analysis of the biological specimens for other drugs revealed the presence of ethanol (blood, 35 mg/dL; vitreous, 56 mg/dL; and urine 153 mg/dL) and caffeine (present in all specimens). The combination of these drugs produced lethal concentrations of clozapine and high therapeutic to toxic concentrations of fluoxetine. The deceased had pulmonary edema, visceral vascular congestion, paralytic ileus, gastroenteritis and eosinophilia. These conditions are associated with clozapine toxicity. The combined central nervous system, respiratory and cardiovascular depression of these drugs was sufficient to cause death. The death was determined to be a clozapine overdose due to a fatal drug interaction.

Abstract: 1. Extrapyramidal adverse effects have been reported with the selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants, particularly fluoxetine and paroxetine. 2. Recently, the SSRI sertraline has also been associated with treatment-emergent extrapyramidal syndrome (EPS) side effects. A review of the literature identified thirteen published cases of sertraline-induced EPS, several of which were confounded by the presence of concomitant medications, and few reported quantitative data using rating scales. 3. We present another case of EPS associated with sertraline in which daily ratings were obtained using the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale. 4. This review and case report add to the small but growing literature suggesting that sertraline, like the other SSRI's may cause significant extrapyramidal side-effects. These movement disorders presumably occur through an interaction between serotonergic and dopaminergic pathways, providing an important clinical correlation of interactions between these neurotransmitter systems.

Abstract: We describe the sudden onset of obsessive-compulsive symptoms following a peritoneal infection with alpha-haemolytic streptococci.
A 35-year-old woman with no past history or family history of obsessions or compulsions developed these symptoms 2 weeks after a peritoneal infection.
The patient received 80 mg fluoxetine daily.
She responded to treatment with a progressive reduction in symptoms.
It is suggested that these obsessions and compulsions may be related to an autoimmune response to the streptococcal infection.

Abstract: To report a case of QT prolongation associated with concomitant cyclobenzaprine and fluoxetine administration followed by torsade de pointes potentiated by droperidol.
A 59-year-old white woman who had been receiving long-term fluoxetine and cyclobenzaprine therapy was admitted for Achilles tendon repair. Baseline QTc was prolonged at 497 msec. Prior to surgery, the patient received droperidol, an agent known to prolong the QT interval. During surgery the patient developed torsade de pointes, which progressed into ventricular fibrillation. On postoperative day 1, after cyclobenzaprine discontinuation, the QTc decreased toward normal (440 msec).
Cyclobenzaprine shares anticholinergic effects, tachycardia, and dysrhythmic potential with the tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). Fluoxetine is a known inhibitor of the CYP2D6 isoenzyme (along with CYP3A4 and CYP2C) and has been shown to increase TCA serum concentrations. The combination of cyclobenzaprine and fluoxetine resulted in significant QT prolongation in our patient that progressed to torsade de pointes after preoperative droperidol administration. Resolution of QT abnormalities after cyclobenzaprine discontinuation provided further evidence of a drug-induced etiology. Other possible medical and drug-related causes of torsade de pointes are reviewed and ruled out.
Clinicians should be aware of the dysrhythmic potential of cyclobenzaprine and fluoxetine, monitor for other cytochrome P450 inhibitors, and avoid concomitant drugs known to prolong the QT interval.

Abstract: Zolpidem (Ambien) is a sedative believed to act exclusively at the benzodiazepine omega 1 receptor. Sporadic case reports of zolpidem-associated hallucinations have appeared over the past 5 years, and over the past 2 years, the Washington Poison Center received five reports of prolonged visual hallucinations associated with zolpidem.
All five patients reported experiencing visual hallucinations lasting from 1-7 hours soon after taking zolpidem. Most had been taking zolpidem for less than a week and all five were concurrently taking an antidepressant: sertraline, desipramine, fluoxetine, bupropion, or venlafaxine; two sought assistance at a hospital.
The precise mechanism of zolpidem-associated hallucinations remains unknown. In some previously published cases, the zolpidem-associated hallucinations have been short in duration, lasting at most 30 minutes. In contrast, the five patients in our series and in five previously reported cases, the hallucinations were more persistent, lasting up to 7 hours. Of these ten cases with persistent symptoms, nine were concurrently taking antidepressants that inhibit serotonin-reuptake, despite the fact that zolpidem has no known serotonin-mediated mechanisms.
These cases, plus prior case reports, suggest that a pharmacodynamic interaction between serotonin reuptake inhibition and zolpidem may lead to prolonged zolpidem-associated hallucinations in susceptible individuals.

Abstract: In a sample of 40 youths (ages 11-17) with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and mood disorders who were treated with behavior therapy, 20 patients received serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) and 20 did not. In open-label clinical treatment, 30% of the patients (6/20) treated with SRIs developed manic or hypomanic symptoms (5/15 on fluoxetine, 1/1 on sertraline). Symptoms included impulsivity, grandiosity, pressured speech, and disinhibition and did not resemble akathisia or "behavioral activation." These behaviors emerged despite gradual dose elevation (2-5 mg/wk), conservative dosing (maximum 40 mg daily), and careful weekly outpatient monitoring of each patient. Fluoxetine-induced mania occurred at doses as low as 10 mg daily. It is unclear whether mania/hypomania would appear in OCD children without comorbid mood disorders or, alternatively, whether OCD is a stronger risk factor than mood disorder for manic switch in SRI-treated youths. Clinicians are advised to be aware of the risk and to be vigilant in monitoring manic and hypomanic behaviors when using SRIs to treat OCD in youth, even with low doses and gradual dose elevation.

Abstract: We report the case of a male individual who developed a severe photosensitive reaction after sun exposure during therapy with fluoxetin 20 mg bid plus alprazolam 0.25 mg bid due to depressive disturbances. The patients, of North-African origin, was not taking other prescription medications nor over the counter products; in the past he had never shown any reaction to sunlight nor had ever used sun protective agents because of its phenotypical skin mark. Three months later, after a second photosensitive reaction, the pharmacological therapy was finally discontinued.

Abstract: After her daughter died, depression developed in a 93-year-old woman with congestive heart failure receiving digoxin therapy. After treatment with fluoxetine hydrochloride she became anorexic and her serum digoxin level increased. A possible interaction, which has not been reported in the literature, may have occurred between fluoxetine and digoxin.

Abstract: To document a case of serotonin syndrome associated with venlafaxine and fluoxetine that did not involve a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, and to examine the multiple factors, including pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic interactions, that likely caused this adverse drug reaction (ADR).
A 39-year-old white woman with depression and panic attacks was being treated with fluoxetine, trazodone, clonazepam, and cimetidine. After fluoxetine and clonazepam were abruptly discontinued, venlafaxine and lorazepam were started. Within 24 hours, she developed diaphoresis, tremors, slurred speech, myoclonus, restlessness, impaired thinking, and diarrhea. This constellation meets Sternbach's criteria for serotonin syndrome.
The possible contributors to this ADR are discussed, including a single drug effect (e.g., an idiosyncratic reaction to venlafaxine), a pharmacokinetic interaction, a pharmacodynamic interaction, a combined pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic interaction, and the patient' s panic disorder.
As more serotonergic drugs are developed and used for psychiatric disorders, frequently in combination or close temporal proximity, clinicians must be aware of and consider the factors that may increase the risk of patients experiencing serotonin syndrome.

Abstract: The association of compulsive water drinking with bulimia nervosa is rarely encountered. Nevertheless similar behavior patterns could involve a common pathophysiological mechanism.
A case report with the association of those two disorders is described. Treatment with fluoxetine was introduced to alleviate the compulsive aspects of those disorders.
Fluoxetine had a positive effect on bulimia nervosa but none on compulsive water drinking.
The different response to pharmacologic treatment could mean that bulimia nervosa and compulsive water drinking are based on different physiological mechanisms.

Abstract: Serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI)-induced sexual dysfunction is common, and a number of pharmacologic adjunctive strategies have been employed to treat this vexing problem. This open label study tested the efficacy of adjunctive bupropion across several measures of sexual function. Patients taking SRIs for various mood or anxiety disorders who reported prospective decline in sexual function after at least 2 months on SRIs were offered treatment with bupropion, 75 mg/day. Eight patients were treated, and sexual function was measured by use of a visual analog scale at 1 month of treatment. Four of eight patients experienced marked improvement in sexual dysfunction following adjunctive bupropion treatment. Bupropion may be a pharmacologic option for treating SRI-associated sexual dysfunction, though controlled clinical trials are needed.

Abstract: Six subjects who as children had received a diagnosis of seasonal affective disorder consented to participate in a 7-year follow-up study. Structured and semistructured interviews were conducted to assess the course of illness, response to treatment, and current clinical state. Seasonal patterns of symptoms and response to light therapy remained relatively stable over a 7-year period. Two subjects were using adjunctive fluoxetine. Seasonal affective disorder can occur in children and adolescents, responds to light therapy, and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of pediatric affective symptoms or cyclic school performance.

Abstract: We evaluated the antidepressant and mood-stabilizing effects of lamotrigine, a novel anticonvulsant, in a group of rapid-cycling bipolar patients. Most were already nonresponders or poor partial responders to other conventional mood-stabilizing agents.
This open, naturalistic, and prospective study was conducted with five rapid-cycling bipolar patients (DSM-IV). Each received lamotrigine titrated to a minimum dose of 150 mg/day as monotherapy or in combination with other psychotropic agents. Patients were assessed with the Global Assessment Scale (GAS), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) for evidence of cycling mood.
Lamotrigine was used at a mean +/- SD dose of 185.0 +/- 33.5 mg/day for 225.8 +/- 28.0 days. Random regression modeling of data showed significant dose- and time-dependent improvements in depressive symptoms and social function of patients taking lamotrigine (Dose: z = 2.17, p < .03 for BDI, z = 4.44, p < .001 for GAS; Time: z = -3.79, p < .001 for BDI, z = 2.16, p < .03 for GAS). Further random regression modeling analysis of change over time in symptoms prior to lamotrigine compared with symptoms during lamotrigine treatment showed a significant treatment by time effect for GAS (z = 2.40, p < .016) and a trend for BDI scores (z = -1.79, p < .073). No significant time or dosage effect or time by treatment effect was observed for YMRS. Finally, t statistics showed a significant reduction in mean BDI scores following treatment with lamotrigine (t = -5.26, p < .006). Lamotrigine was well tolerated by all patients; only one patient experienced several side effects, which were probably due to interaction between several psychotropic medications.
Lamotrigine augmentation therapy and monotherapy appeared to have mood-stabilizing and antidepressant efficacy in the treatment of five rapid-cycling bipolar patients. The effect persisted for an average of 7.5 months.

Abstract: The use of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine is associated with only minor cardiovascular effects. However, due to a possible inhibitory effect on the metabolism of calcium channel blockers it may potentiate the activity of nifedipine, causing profound adverse cardiovascular effects. This report describes the appearance of profound weakness, orthostatic hypotension and tachycardia following the initiation of fluoxetine treatment in a nifedipine-treated 80-year-old patient.

Abstract: A 53-year-old patient suffering from delusional disorder developed an anticholinergic syndrome 19 days after initiation of paroxetine in addition to a steady dose of clozapine. The clozapine plasma concentration had doubled and was in the toxic range. On re-exposition with a lower clozapine dosage the increase was significantly lower. The importance of a dose-dependent interaction of both drugs is emphasized and a possible pharmacological explanation described. With regard to interactions of SSRIs and clozapine, fluvoxamine, a potent inhibitor of cytochrome P450 1A2, gives rise to higher clozapine levels at an earlier time, compared to other SSRIs (paroxetine, fluoxetine and sertraline), which are potent cytochrome P450 2D6 inhibitors.

Abstract: Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) has become a topic of increasing public concern. Several conditions have been described in patients who are afraid that they have acquired AIDS, including depression, somatization disorders, hypochondriasis, adjustment disorders and various psychoses. This paper presents a case study of a young man with persistent fear of having AIDS. In spite of negative HIV test results, the patient still insisted that he suffered from AIDS. The psychiatric diagnosis was major depressive disorder with delusion of having AIDS. The patient was treated with fluoxetine 40 mg qd and sulpiride 400 mg qn. After two weeks on medication, his fear of AIDS subsided and he improved remarkably. The most important intervention in patients with delusion of having AIDS is to identify and treat the underlying psychopathology. The following case is representative of our experience.

Abstract: To describe two cases of stomatitis related to fluoxetine given for the treatment of depression that were detected in the hospital emergency department.
Two women developed stomatitis after the intake of fluoxetine for the treatment of depression. One of the patients had six recurrent episodes of stomatitis without suspecting an association with fluoxetine. No other drugs were administered during these episodes. The second patient was treated concurrently with fluoxetine and bentazepam. In both patients the lesion improved upon discontinuation of fluoxetine, even though the second patient continued to take a different benzodiazepine.
Stomatitis related to fluoxetine has not been previously reported in clinical trials or in the literature. According to the causal algorithm used by the Spanish Drug Surveillance Schemes, the first case constituted a defined adverse reaction and the second was probable.
Our observations suggest that fluoxetine may be considered as a probable cause of stomatitis. The reporting of isolated cases of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) makes it possible to define the toxicity profile of recently marketed drugs such as selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors, including fluoxetine. Emphasis is placed on the potential role played by emergency departments in detecting ADRs.

Abstract: A patient with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) had a major depressive episode that was responsive to treatment with the antidepressant fluoxetine. In contrast to the remission of other symptoms of depression, the associated feature of survivor guilt became more dramatically obvious. Individualized treatment of survivor guilt may be needed for patients with PTSD and major depression.

Abstract: Serotonin reuptake inhibitors, such as fluoxetine, fenfluramine, and dexfenfluramine, are frequently used to treat obesity, depression, and bulimia. A common side effect of these medications is xerostomia, or dry mouth. A case study demonstrating the impact of drug-induced xerostomia on oral health and subsequent nutrition implications is presented. Rampant caries can result from a combination of xerostomia and inappropriate dietary and oral hygiene habits. Preventive dietary and dental guidelines are presented to assist nutrition and dental professionals in treating and counseling patients with xerostomia.

Abstract: We report on a 7-year-old girl with anorexia nervosa and consider factors contributing to this early emergency. Cognitive differences in younger children can alter their understanding of this illness, so we chronicled this girl's treatment because it diverged from practices used with older patients. Accordingly, effective interventions in very young anorexics might require modifications of treatments used in postpubertal populations.

Abstract: Serotonin syndrome is the result of the drug interaction that enhances serotonergic tone in the central nervous system. The neurological manifestations are transient in most of the reported cases with rare fatality.
A 30-year-old woman developed ischemic infarction of the right temporoparietal and cerebellar hemispheres 48 hours after administration of a large dose of clomipramine. This drug was given within 24 hours of discontinuation of high-dose fluoxetine, both of which are known to enhance serotonergic tone in the central nervous system. The distribution of the ischemic infarction in this case did not respect the major territorial arteries and was similar to spreading oligemia/ischemia that is described in migraine. A similar pathogenesis may exist for stroke in serotonin syndrome and in migraine.

Abstract: This report describes a patient with an acute intentional fluoxetine exposure who developed unique cardiovascular and neurovascular toxicity. The patient presented with lethargy and cardiac conduction delays (QRS 110 msec, QTc 458 msec) and developed a delayed seizure. On admission, therapy with intravenous sodium bicarbonate promptly narrowed the QRS to 90 msec. A comprehensive toxicology screen demonstrated only a serum fluoxetine concentration of 901 ng/mL (therapeutic range, 37-301), a serum norfluoxetine concentration of 451 ng/mL (29-329) and a serum acetaminophen concentration of 174 mg/L. Tricyclic antidepresants were specifically noted to be absent. A self-limiting generalized seizure was witnessed 16 hours after ingestion. At this time the bicarbonate infusion had been ceased and the QRS interval was not prolonged. The patient improved over time and no other apparent causes for the observed clinical effects could be discovered. Emergency physicians need to be aware of the uncommon occurrence of fluoxetine-induced cardiotoxicity and the potential benefit of sodium bicarbonate therapy.

Abstract: To report two cases of perhexiline toxicity associated with selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor (SSRI) treatment.
Serum perhexiline concentrations progressively increased after a 69-year-old man was concurrently prescribed paroxetine for the treatment of depression. An 84-year-old woman was admitted to hospital with severe, symptomatic perhexiline toxicity associated with fluoxetine treatment.
In both cases, perhexiline therapy was suspended and treatment with SSRIs was withdrawn.
Serum perhexiline concentrations declined following the withdrawal of paroxetine in one case, but in the case of the second patient perhexiline concentrations were extremely slow to decrease, resulting in referral to a rehabilitative care unit for convalescence.
Serum perhexiline concentrations may be elevated during concurrent treatment with SSRIs, potentially resulting in severe toxicity.

Abstract: The discontinuation of many pharmacologic agents is associated with characteristic withdrawal symptoms. Antidepressants, particularly the tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), are known to be associated with a group of common symptoms upon discontinuation. Serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) are also taking their respective place in the literature with reports of discontinuation symptoms. This review summarizes case reports and reports that allow systematic assessment of discontinuation symptoms following SRI discontinuation.
A computerized literature search was conducted using a MEDLINE search to identify reports of withdrawal effects following discontinuation of SRIs. Additional reports were found in the bibliographies of various published reports.
SRI discontinuation symptoms in adults are summarized in 24 case reports and 9 reports from controlled clinical trials. Additionally, 3 case reports addressing SRI discontinuation in the neonate are described. The reports describe clusters of symptoms commonly associated with the discontinuation of an SRI.
We propose to define an antidepressant discontinuation syndrome as the onset of a cluster of somatic and psychic symptoms following the discontinuation of an SRI and not attributable to other causes (e.g., concomitant medication, illness). These symptoms include dizziness, light-headedness, insomnia, fatigue, anxiety/agitation, nausea, headache, and sensory disturbance. The syndrome may last up to 3 weeks and may be improved by restarting the antidepressant or starting an antidepressant with a similar pharmacologic profile.

Abstract: Three women with several diagnoses, including depression and psychosis, personality disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, alcohol abuse, and physical disease, were treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (fluoxetine, paroxetine, fluvoxamine). One patient was prescribed paroxetine in addition to methylphenidate. While receiving these agents, two women experienced undesirable sexual arousal and the third had increased sexual desire, arousal, and hypersexuality.

Abstract: The hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme system is involved in the metabolism of numerous drugs. Specific enzymes are associated with the metabolism of specific drugs. The potential for drug interactions arises when one drug inhibits or induces the enzyme(s) responsible for metabolism of another drug given concurrently. Most psychotropics are metabolized by these enzymes. Clinically significant drug interactions are reported between the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and other psychotropics. Specifically, interactions between fluoxetine and phenytoin are reported with substantial elevations of phenytoin concentrations. Phenytoin is metabolized by the CYP2C subfamily, and fluoxetine is known to inhibit this subfamily. Similarly, sertraline also inhibits the CYP2C subfamily, but no case reports to date have been identified. To minimize and prevent these interactions, one must be aware of the P450 enzymes involved in drug metabolism. The significance of these interactions seems to rely both on the concentration of the drug at the enzyme and its potency for inhibiting the enzyme. Frequent monitoring of serum concentrations of drugs with a narrow therapeutic range would be appropriate when a potential inhibitor is added. This article describes an apparently similar interaction between sertraline and phenytoin in two elderly patients, which resulted in elevated phenytoin concentrations without symptoms of toxicity.

Abstract: Many patients with affective illness show partial or otherwise unsatisfactory responses to standard treatments, encouraging trials of combinations of pharmacologically dissimilar antidepressants.
Records of consecutive outpatients with affective disorders only partially responsive to treatment with a serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI) or bupropion, alone, were reviewed for changes in specific symptoms and risks of adverse events when an SRI and bupropion were combined.
Greater symptomatic improvement was found in 19 (70%) of 27 subjects during a mean +/- SD of 11 +/- 14 months of combined daily use of bupropion (243 +/- 99 mg) with an SRI (31 +/- 16 mg fluoxetine-equivalents) than with either agent alone. Adverse effect risks were similar to those associated with each monotherapy, with a > 10% incidence of sexual dysfunction (N = 11, 41%), insomnia (N = 6, 22%), anergy (N = 4, 15%), and tremor (N = 3, 11%) during combined therapy; there were no seizures.
With conservative dosing and close monitoring, combinations of SRIs with bupropion in this uncontrolled clinical series appeared to be safe and often more effective than monotherapy.

Abstract: New serotonin reuptake inhibitors are available for the treatment of affective disorders and sleep dysfunction in traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients. Commonly reported serotonergic side-effects include nausea, headache, dizziness, nervousness and orthostatic hypotension. Trazodone, a non-selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, is often used in conjunction with fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, in order to combat the insomnia associated with fluoxetine. Successful use of this combination is generally limited by the cumulative serotonergic side-effects of the two medications. This paper describes the first reported case of speech dysfunction as a complication of combined trazodone and fluoxetine use. A 43-year-old male suffered bilateral wrist fractures and a moderate TBI during a fall. Within 1 week of adding fluoxetine to trazodone the patient developed new-onset dysarthria and speech blocking. Upon discontinuation of fluoxetine, speech returned to normal. Possible mechanisms include inhibition of hepatic metabolism, unmasking of caudate nucleus injury, increased noradrenergic activity or previously unreported serotonergic effects. This case illustrates the importance of monitoring drug combinations for unexpected side-effects in the TBI population.

Abstract: Kleptomania, one of the rare impulse-control disorders, is characterized by an irresistible impulse to steal objects not needed for personal use or monetary value. There is a comorbidity between mood disorders, eating disorders, anxiety disorders, personality disorders, and kleptomania. Several recent case reports have suggested that serotonin reuptake inhibitors could be effective in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorders and specifically in kleptomania. We describe three depressed patients who paradoxically experienced kleptomanic behavior during treatment with serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors.

Abstract: A case in which prescription medications induced heat intolerance which led to heat stroke is presented. A subject who suffered from depression and was treated with fluoxetine HCL (prozac) and lithium carbonate was engaged in mild intermittent work for 4 hours under hot/dry climatic conditions (Ta = 37 degrees C, rh = 15%). The subject lost consciousness, was hyperthermic and suffered from disseminated intravascular coagulation. A year later residual cerebellar symptoms were still evident and severe atrophy of the cerebellar tissue was demonstrated in a CT scan. It is suggested that drug-induced heat intolerance was the predisposing factor that reduced the patient ability to sustain exercise-heat stress, and under the favorable environmental circumstances led to excessive heat accumulation which ultimately caused heat stroke. This is the first description, to our knowledge, of heat intolerance of a patient treated by a combination of fluoxetine and lithium carbonate.

Abstract: To describe a striking, and hitherto unreported, side-effect of fluoxetine.
Four patients given fluoxetine developed involuntary vivid recall of earlier life events.
The side-effect ceased after fluoxetine was discontinued.
The implications of this finding are discussed, particularly with regard to the nature of long-term memory.

Abstract: We describe the use of dexfenfluramine (Redux) in six patients with mood disorders (bipolar disorder = 3; major depression = 3) who developed significant weight gain as a result of their psychotropics. All patients were females with an age range of 27-58 years. The duration of the trial varied from 3 to 20 weeks, with the dexfenfluramine dosage being 15 mg twice daily. Weight loss ranged from 2 to 23 pounds. None of the patients had any evidence of primary pulmonary hypertension or serotonin syndrome, despite being on serotonergic agents such as fluoxetine, paroxetine, and sertraline.

Abstract: We are reporting about a patient with major depression who failed to respond to pharmacotherapy due to ultra-rapid metabolism of maprotiline. Under daily oral doses of 175 mg maprotiline, the patient's metabolic ratio (MR) for maprotiline in plasma was 9.2 (expected MRp: 2.4) and the clearance of maprotiline (CLM) was 4190 ml.min-1 (expected CLM = 1220 in extensive metabolisers of CYP2D6).
The patient's MRurine for sparteine was 0.5, which is within the range for extensive metabolisers of CYP2D6. Genotyping did not show a duplication of the CYP2D6L allele. The patient's caffeine half-life was 10 h, thus, precluding ultra-rapid metabolism for CYP1A2. The therapeutic regiment was changed to co-administration of 200 mg maprotiline and 20 mg fluoxetine once per day in order to inhibit metabolism via CYP2D6. Subsequently, MRP of maprotiline (4.9) and CLM were reduced (1900 ml.min-1; expected CLM in poor metabolisers: of CYP2D6 364). This regimen improved the clinical outcome of the underlying disease.
We conclude that for the non-response seen with maprotiline, P450 isozymes other than CYP2D6 or CYP1A2 are responsible. As CYP2C19 is involved in the metabolism of a number of tricyclic antidepressants it may be a candidate for ultra-rapid metabolism in this patient.

Abstract: Plasma concentrations and response to antidepressants vary considerably between patients treated with similar dosages. Most antidepressants and also antipsychotics are metabolized by the polymorphic debrisoquine/sparteine hydroxylase, i.e., cytochrome P450 (CYP)2D6. About 7% of Caucasians are poor metabolizers (PM), and such patients might develop adverse drug reactions when treated with recommended doses of, for example, tricyclic antidepressants. In contrast, ultrarapid metabolizers with multiple CYP2D6 genes might require high doses of such drugs for optimal therapy. The mean CYP2D6 activity is lower in Oriental than in Caucasian populations, because of a frequent mutation causing decreased enzyme activity. Drugs metabolized by the same enzyme may interact with each other. For example, the potent CYP2D6 inhibitor fluoxetine increases the plasma concentrations of tricyclic antidepressants. Another enzyme catalyzing the metabolism of antidepressants is the polymorphic S-mephenytoin hydroxylase. CYP2C19, which catalyses the metabolism of, for example, citalopram, clomipramine and moclobemide. Various probe drugs may be used for phenotyping CYP2D6 (debrisoquine, dextromethorphan and sparteine) and CYP2C19 (mephenytoin and omeprazole). Allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods are now available for genotyping using leukocyte DNA. A major advantage of genotyping compared with phenotyping is that the former may be performed in blood samples from patients irrespective of treatment.

Abstract: We present the case of a 71-year-old female suffering from bipolar affective disorder type 2 and an old lacunar brain infarct who, under the combined treatment of fluoxetine for depression and low dose trazodone for the accompanying insomnia, developed a toxic delirium. The subject presented with mental state changes (confusion and agitation), hyperreflexia, diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting, fever, and a general tonic-clonic seizure which developed soon after an increase in the trazodone dose. One year prior to the above episode, she was hospitalized for a transient episode of agitated confusion while being treated with fluvoxamine for depression, alprazolam and brotazolam for the accompanying anxiety and insomnia. Both episodes subsided spontaneously when treatment was discontinued. This case reports the possible existence of increased vulnerability to hyperserotonergic states in elderly patients suffering from concomitant psychiatric and neurological disorders.

Abstract: Dystonic reactions produce twisting and repetitive movements or abnormal posturing; this sign is considered an extrapyramidal sequela that is most typically thought to arise from decreased dopamine activity in the basal ganglia. Severe dystonic reactions have been shown to occur in concert with numerous medications. Although most commonly described with anti-psychotic agents such as haloperidol and phenothiazine, dystonic reactions have been observed in those who have used fluoxetine, erythromycin, crack cocaine, phenobarbital, cisapride, and buspirone. This report details the case of a patient who developed an acute dystonic reaction while taking ranitidine for peptic ulcer prophylaxis, a complication that, to our knowledge, has yet to be described with the use of this agent.

Abstract: Fluoxetine is widely prescribed for depressed patients. Hyponatremia secondary to inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone has been reported in a few cases associated with routine use of fluoxetine, especially in elderly patients. The mechanism has been postulated to be linked to the inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone. Serum concentrations of antidiuretic hormone and fluoxetine have not been reported in previously published reports.
We report two new cases of severe and reversible hyponatremia associated with routine use of fluoxetine therapy in two elderly women. Fluoxetine-induced inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone was confirmed by elevated serum concentrations of antidiuretic hormone and fluoxetine.

Abstract: Fluoxetine and its metabolite norfluoxetine are eliminated by oxidative metabolism via the CYP450 system and may inhibit the oxidative metabolism of other drugs to various degrees. A fluoxetine-warfarin interaction has been postulated, but is not well documented in the literature. The elimination of diazepam may also be inhibited by fluoxetine. An elderly man was prescribed these three drugs in combination and experienced such an interaction. He developed an elevated international normalized ratio (INR) and died from a cerebral hemorrhage. He also manifested drug delirium secondary to inhibited diazepam metabolism. In elderly patients receiving fluoxetine, lorazepam or oxazepam would be safer alternatives to diazepam since they are conjugated in the liver. Patients stabilized on warfarin should be monitored closely for changes in INR if fluoxetine is added or deleted.

Abstract: The patient presenting with binge-eating disorder requires a detailed clinical assessment that takes into account behavioral, somatic, and psychological aspects of the disorder. Treatment selection depends on the patient's particular goals. Antidepressant medications and CBT are effective, at least in the short term, in suppressing binge eating and reducing depressive symptoms. Fluoxetine may, in addition, promote short-term weight loss, which is more likely to be maintained if medication is administered in the context of behavior therapy. Preliminary study suggests that behavior therapy may be designed to promote weight loss, even in the absence of medication treatment, without undermining binge cessation. Appetite suppressant medications clearly promote weight loss, but their use in suppressing binge eating has yet to be studied specifically. Further study is needed in several areas including the feasibility and efficacy of treatment approaches that combine medication and psychotherapy, the efficacy of individual versus group psychotherapy, the long-term outcome of various forms of treatment, and the clinical features that predict favorable response to different treatment modalities.

Abstract: To report the case of a patient with possible paroxetine-induced bruxism that was effectively treated with buspirone.
A 20-year-old woman with no active medical conditions besides acne and no history of dental problems was seen in an outpatient psychiatry clinic for the evaluation of ongoing depression. The patient was prescribed paroxetine 10 mg every morning. After 5 days of therapy the patient reported no adverse effects, and the paroxetine dosage was increased to 20 mg every morning. Due to increased somnolence, the dosing schedule was subsequently changed to 20 mg hs. Two months later during a dental visit for a tooth extraction, the dentist noted that the patient's teeth appeared damaged in what he believed to be a pattern consistent with the grinding and clenching of teeth. Prior to this time, dental examinations had not revealed any tooth damage. The patient was thought to have paroxetine-induced bruxism and, based on earlier case reports, was treated with buspirone 5 mg hs. On day 4 of buspirone therapy the patient reported a significant reduction in the extent of gritting, tooth pain, and jaw tenderness.
The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) fluoxetine and sertraline have been associated with bruxism in previous reports. This case suggests paroxetine-induced bruxism. The exact mechanism of SSRI-induced bruxism remains unclear. Many theories have been proposed, including sleep disturbance, serotonergic-mediated inhibition of dopamine manifesting as akathisia, and SSRI-induced anxiety. According to published reports, SSRI-induced bruxism may respond to therapy with buspirone. Consistent with these reports, this patient responded favorably to buspirone therapy.
Clinicians should be aware that the potential for paroxetine-induced bruxism exists and that buspirone may be an appropriate therapeutic intervention.

Abstract: Stereotypical behaviors are common in captive animals, particularly captive polar bears. Effects of oral administration of fluoxetine on chronic stereotypical and typical behaviors in a captive polar bear were monitored. Fluoxetine treatment terminated stereotypic pacing behavior, facial tic, and huffing/coughing activity. The expression of typical polar bear behaviors was not affected by fluoxetine treatment, although the proportion of time spent engaged in typical behaviors changed during the course of the observation period. Response of the bear to fluoxetine treatment indicated that pharmacologic manipulation of the serotonergic system can safely eliminate stereotypical behaviors in captive polar bears.

Abstract: Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and major depression are common ailments that can cause significant dysfunction throughout the life cycle. These two disorders may occur comorbidly. This case series describes 7 pediatric patients (aged 10-16 years) and 4 adults (aged 38-44 years) whose ADHD and comorbid major depression were treated in a naturalistic open clinical fashion. For all 11 patients, symptoms of major depression appeared to respond well to either fluoxetine or sertraline monotherapy. Using starting doses of fluoxetine 10 mg or sertraline 25 mg daily, we did not observe any adverse behavioral activation or clinical deterioration. However, no improvement in ADHD symptoms was observed in any patient during fluoxetine or sertraline monotherapy. Adjunctive treatment with a psychostimulant seemed necessary for chronic ADHD symptoms to be effectively addressed. The psychostimulants did not appear to provide observable antidepressant effects. With the exception of one adult who had a 20 mm Hg increase in diastolic pressure on methylphenidate monotherapy at 22.5 mg daily, the administration and coadministration of these agents were not associated with significant changes in blood pressure or heart rate. No patient developed suicidality, increased aggressiveness, mania, or other problematic side effects. This combination therapy was well tolerated and appeared to be effective in ameliorating both ADHD and depressive symptoms. These cases support previous suggestions that adjunctive treatment with psychostimulants might be a safe and effective intervention for children treated with fluoxetine or sertraline who have persistent ADHD symptoms and suggests that such combined treatment may be suitable for adults as well.

Abstract: Venlafaxine (V) is a second-generation antidepressant approved for use in the United States in 1993. It is a derivative of phenethylamine and is structurally unrelated to first- and other second-generation antidepressants. Nevertheless, its mechanism of action is similar to other antidepressants; it inhibits the reuptake of presynaptic norepinephrine and serotonin. Its major routes of elimination involve O and N demethylation. O-Desmethylvenlafaxine (ODV) is biologically active. Therapeutic concentrations of V and ODV are approximately 0.2 and 0.4 mg/L, respectively. Three cases of drug intoxication involving V are presented. V and ODV were identified by gas chromatography-nitrogen-phosphorus detection after alkaline extraction of the biological specimen. On an HP-5 column, V and ODV elute after bupropion and fluoxetine, but prior to the first-generation antidepressants, sertraline, amoxapine, and trazodone. V and ODV were confirmed by full scan electron impact gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The heart-blood V and ODV concentrations (mg/L) in the three cases were 6.6 and 31; 84 and 15; and 44 and 50, respectively. In Case 1, acetaminophen and diphenhydramine were found in the heart blood at 140 and 2.6 mg/L respectively. In Case 2, amitriptyline, nortriptyline, and chlordiazepoxide were found in the blood at 2.8, 0.5 and 3.3 mg/L, respectively. In each case, the manner of death was suicide.

Abstract: We report nine cases where fluoxetine (FX) (20 mg/day) was added to maintenance treatment with methadone (MTD) (dose range: 30-100 mg) in addicts with affective disorders. MTD plasma levels were measured before and after treatment with FX under steady-state conditions. Among the nine patients, two also received fluvoxamine (FLVX) at different times. Although it is possible that in some patients a moderate FX-MTD interaction occurs, resulting in increased plasma levels of MTD, this interaction is certainly less marked than that between FLVX and MTD and unlikely to have clinical consequences.

Abstract: Three cases in which patients who were taking fluoxetine for relief of depression showed patterns of abnormal movements suggestive of tardive dyskinesia are presented. In the first case, abnormal facial movements began four weeks after fluoxetine was added to doxepin and lithium and remitted after fluoxetine was discontinued. In the second case, abnormal movements of the mouth and hands were noticed four years after the patient started taking fluoxetine and continued to be present a year after withdrawal of the medication. In the third case, orofacial dyskinesia that had remitted after withdrawal of sertraline and paroxetine and reappeared with fluoxetine was still present eight months after fluoxetine was withdrawn.

Abstract: 1. The role of serotonin in the aetiology of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) has been established through considerable indirect evidence (Landry and Chouinard, 1990). The strongest evidence comes from the fact that drugs known to be serotonin-selective reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have been found to be useful in the pharmacotherapy of OCD (Landry and Chouinard, 1990). 2. The authors investigated a new treatment approach by adding an adrenal steroid suppressant to a SSRI, fluoxetine, in the case of a severe obsessive-compulsive patient who was drug-resistant to clomipramine and SSRIs. 3. We found that the combination of aminoglutethimide 250 mg qid and fluoxetine 40 mg die significantly improved the patient's condition. Moreover, during a four and a half year period, each time we tried to decrease either fluoxetine or the steroid suppressant, the patient started to relapse, suggesting that the adrenal steroid suppressant had a potentiating effect on the SSRI.

Abstract: There are reports of alprazolam-induced hypomania/mania. Here is a case report of a patient who developed hypomania during treatment with alprazolam, but not with diazepam, another benzodiazepine derivative.
The illness was of 2 months' duration and the patient received a diagnosis of anxious depression. Following treatment with alprazolam, the patient developed hypomania characterised by euphoria, overactivity, overtalkactivity, racing thoughts, oversocialisation, enhanced self-confidence and disturbed sleep.
Hypomania subsided when alprazolam was withdrawn. There was no recurrence with fluoxetine or diazepam that ameliorated the primary condition.
The patient was symptom-free on follow-up.
Alprazolam can induce hypomania/mania and, perhaps, it differs from other benzodiazepines in its mode of action. Clinicians have to be alert to the possibility of their patients developing hypomania/mania while on alprazolam.

Abstract: To report a case of suspected fluoxetine-induced bruising and review the literature surrounding this rare adverse effect.
A 31-year-old white woman was diagnosed with depression and treated with fluoxetine. After fluoxetine 20 mg/d for 6 weeks, she reported bruising that was disproportionate to any trauma incurred. Her prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and complete blood cell count were within normal limits. Fluoxetine was suspected to be the cause of this bruising. The patient did not want to discontinue the medication and has continued to bruise while continuing fluoxetine therapy.
Frequently encountered adverse effects caused by fluoxetine use include nausea, nervousness, and insomnia, but hematologic effects have also been reported. These include bleeding or bruising with prolonged bleeding time, increased prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time, and thrombocytopenia. The mechanism behind these adverse effects is the prevention of serotonin-induced amplification of platelet aggregation by fluoxetine. Blockade of 5-hydroxytryptamine uptake in the platelets by fluoxetine reduces or depletes the platelet serotonin stores, thereby predisposing a patient with a mild underlying platelet disorder to a fluoxetine-induced hematologic disorder.
Fluoxetine has been reported to produce bruising, bleeding, and other hematologic disorders. It should be used with caution when treating patients with thrombocytopenia or with proven or suspected platelet dysfunction.

Abstract: The hypothalamic obesity syndrome is characterized by hyperphagia and excessive weight gain in the presence of demonstrable hypothalamic injury. There have been no previous reports describing the use of serotonergic agents in this condition. We report on a patient with severe hyperphagia and obesity secondary to a hypothalamic lesion, who was treated with consecutive courses of fluoxetine and fenfluramine. Neither treatment resulted in a reduction in food intake or weight. Treatment of hypothalamic obesity with serotonergic agents appears to be of little value, probably because they exert their effect via intact serotonergic-sensitive hypothalamic nuclei.

Abstract: General principles for treatment-resistant psychiatric disorders include reevaluation of diagnosis, search for hidden comorbidity, and systematic trials of alternative treatments and treatment combinations. For the combination of refractory depression and substance abuse, alternative approaches to both problems need to be tried, as suggested in the decision tree in Figure 1. Recognition of a previously unappreciated substance abuse problem or institution of more effective substance abuse treatment (see Table 2) can improve the outcome of depression. Hospitalization is often useful to enforce abstinence and to clarify the diagnosis of depression, and is particularly indicated if substance abuse is severe. If hospitalization is not possible then features of the history, such as relative onsets of depression and substance abuse, can be considered to support the diagnosis. TCAs and SSRIs have been studied in depressed substance abusers and should be the first lines of treatment. If these fail, other medications, medication combinations, or ECT should be considered, extrapolating from the general literature on treatment of refractory depression. In general, single agents should be preferred to combinations, as this reduces the odds of drug-drug interactions in patients who may abuse a variety of substances. Impairment by antidepressant agents of hepatic metabolism of other drugs should be considered, and sertraline, for example, might be preferred over fluoxetine for this reason. For each case, the known side effects and risks of a given antidepressant medication must be considered in the context of a patient's substance abuse pattern and medical problems. Such risk:benefit analyses are often difficult, as illustrated in the cases presented. Finally, although it is a rare occurrence, antidepressant medications that are anticholinergic or amphetamine-like may be abused, and this needs to be monitored. Alcohol or drug abuse history is a likely risk factor for benzodiazepine abuse, and benzodiazepines should, therefore, be avoided or used with caution. These recommendations for management of treatment-resistant depression with substance abuse are based upon clinical experience and extrapolation from the literature on treatment-resistant depression, treatment of substance abuse, and initial treatment of depression in substance abusers with TCAs and SSRIs. More treatment research is needed, particularly on Type IV patients where both depression and substance use are treatment resistant.

Abstract: We report the case of a 15-year-old girl with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who developed a severe steroid-induced depression, which was rapidly responsive to ECT. This report adds to the growing body of literature supporting ECT as a safe and effective treatment of affective and psychotic disorders in children.

Abstract: We report two cases of complex movement disorders induced by fluoxetine. A 72-year-old woman developed rhythmic palatal movements, myoclonus, chorea, and possibly dystonia after 2 years of therapy with fluoxetine. On withdrawal of fluoxetine, the movements abated after 5 days and did not recur. The second patient, a 58-year-old man, developed myoclonic jerking and rapid, stereotypic movements of his toes after a year of fluoxetine therapy. These complex movements have not been reported previously as an adverse effect of fluoxetine.

Abstract: To report three new cases of the fluoxetine-induced syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH).
All three cases occurred in elderly psychiatric inpatients treated for depression with standard doses of fluoxetine within one month of starting the medication. All three patients were clinically symptomatic of SIADH.
In all three patients the medication was ceased and fluid restriction commenced. One patient required intravenous saline.
All three patients recovered fully within three weeks. None were rechallenged.
The symptoms of hyponatraemia due to fluoxetine-induced SIADH may be difficult to distinguish from the symptoms of depression, unless appropriate laboratory investigations are made.

Abstract: We described two elderly patients with severe hyponatremia that was probably caused by inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone. The hyponatremia arose during fluoxetine (Prozac) antidepressant therapy.

Abstract: Abel's (1993) review of treatments for obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) indicated that both behavioral treatment (exposure with response prevention, and biological treatment (specific serotonin reuptake inhibiting drugs) are effective. It was recognized that having both available for patients is preferable because there would be situations where one treatment is more appropriate than the other. One indication for using drugs would be where situational constraints do not allow for effective exposure treatment. We present a case study of a microbiology technician with AIDS-related OCD who had an excellent response to the administration of fluoxetine without relapse when the drug was discontinued.

Abstract: Fluoxetine and L-deprenyl were prescribed concurrently in a 19-year-old female with Huntington's disease. The patient showed significant affective, behavioral, and motoric improvements and there was no adverse effect resulting from this combination. Concomitant use of L-deprenyl in low doses and fluoxetine may be safe and beneficial in certain clinical situations, although further study is needed.

Abstract: A patient treated with fluoxetin for a manic depressive disorder developed pulmonary inflammatory nodules with noncaseating giant cell granulomas, interstitial pneumonia and non-necrotizing vasculitis, whilst remaining asymptomatic. A progressive resolution of pulmonary nodules occurred after withdrawal of the offending agent, and the chest radiograph returned to normal in 9 months. The diagnosis was assessed by an open lung biopsy.

Abstract: The case of a 21-year-old man with severe developmental disabilities, ring chromosome 22 and rapid-cycling bipolar illness is presented. This is the first reported occurrence of mood disorder in a person with ring chromosome 22. Previously published case reports describing behavioural problems associated with this chromosome disorder suggest that severe hyperactivity is typical and that affected individuals may have an excited mood state. These symptoms are consistent with atypical bipolar disorder and raise the possibility that ring chromosome 22 increases the risk for atypical bipolar disorder.

Abstract: Cataplexy is a common symptom associated with narcolepsy. We evaluated a 51-year-old female who developed symptoms of progressive daytime sleepiness with cataplexy. The diagnosis of narcolepsy was confirmed by overnight polysomnogram and was consistent with results of a multiple sleep latency study, and episodes of cataplexy were documented by video-EEG-EMG monitoring. Examination during a catapletic episode was significant for areflexia and paralysis. The frequency of cataplexy increased with fluoxetine, protriptyline and sertraline and the patient developed frank choreiform movements with protriptyline and sertraline. The cataplexy resolved following treatment with carbamazepine. We feel carbamazepine is a potential treatment for patients with refractory cataplexy.

Abstract: The serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are effective in treating major depressive episodes. However, for the subgroups of patients who remain refractory to therapy, augmentation strategies can improve the efficacy of these agents.
We report the results of an open trial of methylphenidate to augment SSRIs in the treatment of five consecutive cases of DSM-III- R diagnosed major depression.
Self-reported symptom reduction was achieved rapidly in all cases, with methylphenidate dosages ranging from 10 to 40 mg/day. Symptom remission was independent of the presence of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Also, the beneficial effects of the methylphenidate-SSRI combination appeared to be robust and sustained. No patients abused or misused methylphenidate.
The empirical use of methylphenidate added to ineffective or only partially effective SSRI treatment appeared to be a rapid, safe, and efficacious alternative to existing augmentation strategies for the treatment of major depression. Prospective controlled studies are required to confirm or refute these findings.

Abstract: Symptoms of behavioral activation in children and adolescents have been reported as possible adverse effects of treatment with fluoxetine and sertraline. A 15-year-old with a single major depressive episode, dissociative periods, and anxious hyperventilation attacks was started on sertraline 50 mg (1 mg/kg) daily and, within 4 days, raised to 100 mg daily. All major symptoms resolved by 4 weeks with no apparent side effects or adverse behavioral changes. Ratings of Global Assessment of Functioning and Clinical Global Impression Severity of Illness ratings reflected marked clinical improvement. The adolescent remained euthymic for 6 months but then experienced a return of some depressive symptoms. Within 3 days of raising the dose to 150 mg daily, the patient began to exhibit difficulty in falling asleep, hypermotoric behavior, and hypertalkativeness (in association with tremor and blurred vision). This episode was not of sufficient duration and did not fulfill a sufficient number of DSM-IV criteria to qualify as hypomania. The symptoms of behavioral activation lasted for 3 days and disappeared when sertraline was discontinued, but depressive and hyperventilation symptoms returned quickly. Reinstatement of 100 mg produced enduring recovery without the adverse effects. This case appears to suggest that rapid dose elevation may not be as important as dose quantity in eliciting adverse behavioral effects from sertraline. Judging from the few cases now in the medical literature, it appears that sertraline-induced behavioral activation may emerge at doses that vary considerably among individual youths (25-200 mg daily). In short, this drug-induced behavioral activation appears to be dose-dependent, but dose threshold varies widely among patients.

Abstract: Various drugs, including amantadine, have been reported in the successful treatment of antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction. Only a regular daily dosing schedule of amantadine has been used for the treatment of sexual dysfunction so far. This case demonstrates that an intermittent dose of amantadine at 100 mg five to six hours prior to coitus could be useful in the treatment of fluoxetine-induced anorgasmia.

Abstract: Very few cases exist in the literature of maternal obsessional thoughts of child sexual abuse. Two such cases are described of mothers who experienced obsessional thoughts in the puerperium which concerned sexually abusing their own children. Obsessional thoughts of a sexual nature have been shown to occur commonly--in over 25% of those diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive neuroses. These obsessional thoughts concern actions which are usually identified as going against the sufferer's own value systems or involving sexual perversions. Obsessional thoughts of sexually abusing family members are rarely documented; there are no reports of obsessional thoughts experienced by a mother in the puerperium concerning sexual abuse of her own children. We report two cases of mothers suffering from obsessions of this nature at The Mother and Baby Unit (MBU), Queen Elizabeth Psychiatric Hospital, Birmingham.

Abstract: An 83-year-old patient suffering from a depressive episode was treated with a combination of clomipramine and fluoxetine. As no marked improvement was observed and cardiac side-effects were observed, a blood sample was taken for therapeutic drug monitoring. The result showed that the concentrations of clomipramine and desmethylclomipramine were very high (i.e. in the subtoxic range). A metabolic interaction was suspected and both antidepressants were immediately discontinued. Over time, concentrations of clomipramine and its metabolite decreased slowly and, simultaneously, the mood improved and side-effects disappeared. When clomipramine and desmethylclomipramine concentrations reached the lower limit of the optimal therapeutic range, monotherapy was restarted with clomipramine, and the patient improved enough to be discharged from the hospital.

Abstract: Binge-eating disorder, characterized by recurrent eating binges without purging, affects a large number of individuals, especially among participants in weight loss programs. Recent studies have suggested that antidepressants, particularly serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors, may be effective in the treatment of binge-eating disorder. This paper reviews the findings of these studies and offers clinical guidelines for the use of antidepressants in binge-eating disorder.

Abstract: We report a case study of an 18-year-old female who presented with symptoms associated with several discrete diagnostic syndromes: obsessive-compulsive disorder, trichotillomania, major depression, and anorexia nervosa. Improvement in each occurred after treatment with the serotonin selective reuptake inhibitor, fluoxetine, suggesting that such syndromes share a common serotonin neurotransmitter disturbance. Furthermore, the combined effects of medication and psychotherapy resulted in improvement in assertiveness, sense of security, self-worth, flexibility, and self-regulation. We discuss the pharmacological and psychotherapeutic implications of possible psychophysiologic similarities among the previously mentioned syndromes.

Abstract: Depression in the elderly is a common problem, cited as occurring in up to 10% of elderly people living at home, half of whom may need specialist referral. The introduction of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors has been reported as a major advance in the treatment of depression in that they are less sedating, have fewer anticholinergic effects and are less toxic in overdose. We report three cases of severe hyponatraemia, seen in the past 12 months, associated with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors fluoxetine and sertraline. Hyponatraemia has been reported as a rare adverse effect of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.

Abstract: Fluoxetine and other selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are effective for the treatment of depression in the elderly and offer a safer side-effect profile as compared to tricyclics and monoamine oxidase inhibitors. We report a case in which a patient treated with fluoxetine developed parkinsonism following the introduction of cimetidine. Inhibition of hepatic P450 cytochrome enzymes by cimetidine with an increase in serum levels of norfluoxetine may have precipitated this extrapyramidal syndrome, which has been related to agonism of the serotonergic input to nigrostriatal tracts and basal ganglia. Parkinsonism as a side effect of SSRIs occurs infrequently, suggesting an idiosyncratic response resulting from a functional imbalance of serotonergic and dopaminergic activity in susceptible individuals. Careful monitoring of geriatric patients treated with fluoxetine is indicated, particularly for those on high doses, those with impaired hepatic functioning, or those treated with concurrent medications that slow the metabolism of fluoxetine.

Abstract: The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors appear to have a much wider margin of safety than most other classes of antidepressants. Although there is limited experience with acute overdoses of fluoxetine alone, few serious adverse effects have been reported. There has been almost no experience, however, with significant fluoxetine overdoses in children. This report describes the accidental ingestion of as much as 43 mg/kg of fluoxetine by a 4-year-old child. In this case, serum blood levels of the drug and its major metabolite were consistent with a large ingestion and are among the highest reported in the medical literature. Toxic effects were relatively mild and consisted of a brief spell of unresponsiveness, sinus tachycardia, and moderate psychomotor agitation and dyskinesia. Supportive care was provided and the child recovered completely.

Abstract: Body dysmorphic disorder, an often-secret preoccupation with an imagined or slight defect in appearance, is an underrecognized disorder that is unknown to many clinicians. This disorder has gone virtually unmentioned in the adolescent literature, despite the fact that it often occurs during adolescence. Body dysmorphic disorder is more common than is realized and causes significant distress and impairment in functioning. This report presents four cases of adolescents with body dysmorphic disorder, all of who responded to a serotonin reuptake inhibitor. The clinical features of body dysmorphic disorder are reviewed, as are available data on the treatment of this distressing and often-disabling disorder.

Abstract: Previous case reports of seizures following fluoxetine overdose have not adequately ruled out ingestion of other substances and have lacked documentation of increased serum drug levels. We present a case of seizure following fluoxetine overdose in a previously well patient with a clear history of sole ingestion. We ruled out the presence of other substances with comprehensive drug screening and documented increased serum levels of fluoxetine and its active metabolite.

Abstract: Central pontine myelinolysis (CPM) is a rare complication of alcoholism. There have been recent reports that hyponatremia and its rapid correction are of aetiological significance in the development of CPM. We describe the case of a 47-year-old alcoholic who developed CPM and subsequently recovered. Alcoholic and psychiatric patients are at risk for CPM and clinicians need to have a high index of suspicion to diagnose this condition.

Abstract: Selective mutism is a rare disorder with poor treatment outcome. The current study describes the successful treatment of selective mutism in a preschool-age girl, using a comprehensive multifaceted therapeutic approach. The components of this intervention reflect a conceptualization of selective mutism that emphasizes anxiety as a core feature but also focuses on associated factors such as oppositional behaviors.

Abstract: We present two patients with a history of chronic idiopathic urticaria occurring in conjunction with a panic disorder (DSM-IIIR), in whom both the urticaria and panic disorder responded favorably to a course of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants fluoxetine and sertraline, respectively. Both patients had previously required systemic corticosteroids to manage their urticaria. Panic disorder is an anxiety disorder characterized by the presence of recurrent unexpected panic attacks. Serotoninergic mechanisms play an important role in panic disorder. In contrast to antidepressants such as doxepin, which have previously been found to be effective in the treatment of chronic urticaria, the newer selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants are only weakly antihistaminic and anticholinergic. The response of both the urticaria and panic disorder to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants may suggest a common pathogenic factor involving serotoninergic mechanisms.

Abstract: This paper describes the treatment of a physician who developed posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and a polysubstance use disorder after he was shot and held hostage by a patient. Inpatient treatment combined pharmacological and behavioral approaches, including systematic re-exposure via talking about the event in therapy groups. Standard methods for achieving and maintaining abstinence were used, such as asking for and accepting peer support and discussing painful feelings. Cognitive aspects of treatment included education about interactions between the two conditions. After 12 weeks the physician was free of symptoms and had minimal anxiety when exposed to salient cues of the traumatic event.

Abstract: The present case study describes the neurobehavioural, neurodiagnostic, and positron emission tomography (PET) scan findings in a child who sustained a whiplash-type injury in a motor vehicle accident. Although neck and back pain were reported immediately, neurobehavioural symptoms, such as staring spells, gradually increased in frequency over a 2-year period following the accident. At 4 years after the accident the patient's symptoms persisted, as reported by teachers and parents, and more extensive diagnostic work-up was initiated. Standard EEG was normal while two ambulatory EEGs were abnormal and interpreted as epileptiform. A PET scan showed evidence of marked hypometabolism in both temporal lobes. Neuropsychological findings were consistent with PET findings and reflected verbal and visual memory deficits in the context of high average intelligence. Treatment with carbamazepine, verapamil, and fluoxetine greatly improved the patient's symptoms. The present case illustrates an example of a poor outcome in a paediatric case of mild traumatic brain injury, the importance of PET in demonstrating definitive evidence of brain dysfunction, and the child's positive response to anticonvulsant medication.

Abstract: Extrapyramidal side effects induced by some selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), i.e. fluoxetine and sertraline, have been previously reported in patients with depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). However, the occurrence and management of akathisia induced by fluvoxamine have not been described. In the presented case fluvoxamine-induced akathisia in an OCD patient was partially resistant to the anticholinergic agent biperiden, and was successfully treated with the 5-HT2A/5-HT2C antagonist mianserin. Mianserin (15 mg/day at 21.00 h) was discontinued and then reinstituted (off-on-off-on design). Biperiden was transiently effective in the acute akathisia, while the more persistent akathisia was alleviated by mianserin. Discontinuation of mianserin resulted in recurrence of akathisia, while full amelioration of the symptoms of akathisia was noted when mianserin was reinstituted. No aggravation of OCD symptoms was noted during mianserin administration.

Abstract: Clarithromycin is a macrolide antibiotic very similar to erythromycin in structure and spectrum of activity. It has gained increasing use since its release in Canada in May 1992, partly because it is promoted as having less potential for drug interactions and adverse effects. However, as with all new medications, a high degree of vigilance for unreported adverse effects is advisable.
A healthy 53-year-old lawyer was receiving long-term fluoxetine 80 mg hs and nitrazepam 10 mg hs for depression and mild sleep apnea. Subsequent to initiation of treatment with clarithromycin for a respiratory infection, he rapidly developed delirium, which cleared quickly after stopping all 3 medications. The delirium and psychosis did not recur when the infection was treated with erythromycin alone or after restarting fluoxetine and nitrazepam therapy at previous dosages in the absence of antibiotics.
This man's delirium is consistent with fluoxetine intoxication, which appears to have resulted from inhibition of hepatic cytochrome P450 metabolism by clarithromycin. Undiagnosed, this serious drug reaction could have lead to serious medical and social consequences.
As the use of clarithromycin increases, the potential for interactions with other drugs metabolized by the P450 enzyme system may be realized. Clinicians should consider which other medications a patient is receiving before prescribing clarithromycin or any macrolide antibiotic with potential to influence the P450 system.

Abstract: Depression is commonly associated with idiopathic Parkinson's disease. Various antidepressants can be helpful in the treatment of this type of depression. Anticholinergic medications are at times used for treating the motor symptoms of parkinsonism. While some authors have reported euphorigenic effects from anticholinergics in other groups of patients, generally, they have not been used in the treatment of depression, with or without parkinsonism. In the case presented, a depressed patient with Parkinson's disease on levodopa/carbidopa and fluoxetine was given benztropine for his motor symptoms. The result was some improvement in his motor symptoms and a wide, dose-related spectrum of other central nervous system changes ranging from delirium to mania, hypomania, and euthymia from a "baseline" of residual depression. At a very low dose (0.25 mg per day), benztropine appeared to have an augmenting antidepressant effect that rendered the patient euthymic.

Abstract: There appears to be a great deal of excitement regarding the potential of clomipramine and serotonin reuptake inhibitor drugs to treat rapid ejaculation. I worry that pharmacologic intervention will be recommended indiscriminately by busy physicians unaware of the complexities of men's/couples' sexual equilibrium. Interdisciplinary teams need to develop thoughtful guidelines that address the thorny issues surrounding the evolution of this new treatment alternative.

Abstract: Sleep disturbances are found in most depressive patients. Serotonin reuptake inhibitors, such as fluoxetine hydrochloride, seem to improve sleep by changing the depressive affect and the underlying biological mechanisms. Insomnia is an occasional adverse effect of the medication, but it was shown that only 2-3% of the patients with fluoxetine-induced insomnia discontinued the drug for this reason. We could not find any report of nightmares or night terrors under fluoxetine treatment. We report on four patients who experienced nightmares on fluoxetine monotherapy.

Abstract: The study sought to find whether the discontinuation of fluoxetine (Prozac) 14 days prior to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) results in positive patient outcome through improved safety and if the administration of Prozac in close proximity to ECT results in prolonged seizures. Patients who had ECT with 14 days' clearance of Prozac had no prolonged seizure activity. The awareness of possible complications resulting from Prozac and ECT soon became evident among the staff, and every effort was made to communicate this. Prozac has been promoted as being safer than tricyclic antidepressants because of its low cardiac toxicity and relative safety in overdoses.

Abstract: Fluoxetine (Prozac) is an effective and increasingly widely used antidepressant. It is a 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) re-uptake inhibitor. It produces its pharmacological effects by preventing the elimination of the 5-HT produced at nerve synapses, thus increasing its concentration at that location. Ondansetron (Zofran), is a 5-HT3 antagonist, which produces its pharmacological effect by competing with 5-HT receptors at the synapse. When both fluoxetine and ondansetron are used together, there is the possibility that the accumulation of 5-HT resulting from the use of fluoxetine may compete with ondansetron at the receptors, potentially reducing the antiemetic effects of ondansetron. Clinically, this has been observed in three patients treated with both compounds at the same time, while they were receiving carboplatin combination chemotherapy. The possibility that concurrent administration of the 5-HT re-uptake inhibitors, fluoxetine, may reduce the antemetic effectiveness of ondansetron is relevant to the established role of antidepressants in the management of patients with malignant disease, in whom the prevention of emesis is also important. Further investigation of this possible interaction is recommended.

Abstract: Propoxyphene overdose is known to cause widening of the QRS complex on ECG. We report a case of a 54-year-old female who ingested approximately 100 propoxyphene hydrochloride tablets in a suicide attempt. She developed a wide complex dysrhythmia which responded to sodium bicarbonate therapy. Propoxyphene-induced wide complex dysrhythmia responsive to sodium bicarbonate therapy has not been previously reported in the literature.

Abstract: Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is characterized by hypotonia at birth, hypogonadism, early childhood obesity, and mental deficiency. Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism is a major characteristic of patients with PWS, and it is speculated to be due to hypothalamic insufficiency. Two adult female patients with PWS and no prior history of menses are presented. Both of these patients were treated with fluoxetine for psychopharmacologic management of obsessive features in the form of food preoccupation and hyperphagia or for compulsive behaviors in the form of severe self-injurious behaviors. The two female patients with PWS who had primary amenorrhea developed vaginal bleeding believed to be menses following at least 6 months of treatment with fluoxetine. Mature hypothalamic function is characterized by pulsatile release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) in a critical range of frequency and amplitude. Central nervous system neurotransmitters may modify GnRH secretion. Fluoxetine specifically inhibits the reuptake of serotonin which may impact the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian system in female patients with PWS.

Abstract: To report the unusual coincidence of weight loss with increased appetite and food intake in a patient treated for depression on two separate occasions with fluoxetine.
A 27-year-old woman experienced a modest weight loss during treatment for depression with fluoxetine. The weight loss was associated with a reported increase in daily caloric intake and consumption of a greater proportion of dietary fat than usual for the patient. The same patient was treated again with fluoxetine more than a year later and again experienced weight loss associated with an increase in appetite, caloric intake, and dietary fat consumption.
Fluoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor that often is associated with a modest weight loss when used for the treatment of depression, although it also has been reported to have the opposite effects of weight gain and hyperphagia in some patients. The effects on weight usually are assumed to be the result of primary effects on appetite, but the discrepancy between the appetite and weight changes in this case challenges the applicability of that assumption in all cases.
The effects of fluoxetine on appetite and weight may be mediated by partially distinct mechanisms and might conceivably involve a direct metabolic effect in some patients.

Abstract: This paper describes a 14-year-old male patient who complained of memory problems during treatment with fluoxetine for major depression. The patient showed impairments on all five scales of the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised during fluoxetine treatment. Three of the scales, Verbal Memory, Visual Memory, and General Memory, showed statistically significant improvements after fluoxetine was discontinued. This case represents the first time memory deficits related to fluoxetine were quantitated with a standardized memory test. It points to cognitive side effects that need to be understood.

Abstract: A 48-year-old man presented to the emergency department with confusion, agitation, diaphoresis, and muscle rigidity after beginning treatment with fluoxetine, a serotonin reuptake inhibitor. He had discontinued treatment with tranylcypromine, a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, 2 weeks earlier. The constellation of findings was diagnostic of the serotonin syndrome.

Abstract: There is a new, potentially fatal disorder that is infrequently reported. The apparent rareness may be because of a lack of recognition of the syndrome or its predisposing factors. Fluoxetine (Prozac, Dista Products Co, Division of Eli Lilly Co, Indianapolis, IN), sertraline (Zoloft, Roerig Division, Pfizer Inc, New York, NY), and paroxetine (Paxil, SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals, Philadelphia, PA) belong to a new class of antidepressant medication: the serotonin reuptake-inhibitors (SRIs). The relative safety profile of the SRIs has led to their widespread use. However, a syndrome of excessive serotonergic activity, the "serotonin syndrome" (SS), has recently been recognized. It is characterized by changes in mental status, hypertension, restlessness, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, diaphoresis, shivering, and tremor. A high index of suspicion is required to make the diagnosis in these acutely ill patients. The most common agents implicated in SS are the monoamine oxidase inhibitors in combination with L-tryptophan or fluoxetine. A case of a patient with significant peripheral vascular disease who developed SS while taking paroxetine and an over-the-counter cold medicine is reported. There have been no prior reports of this interaction. Discontinuation of the offending agents, sedation, and supportive care are the mainstays of treatment. The interactions of serotonin with platelets and vascular endothelium are also discussed.

Abstract: In a frail, elderly, depressed patient, hyponatremia can present a difficult diagnostic and management challenge. We report the case of a severely depressed 83-year-old woman presenting with severe hyponatremia, eventually attributed to a syndrome of inappropriate, antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) secretion induced by fluoxetine. This case is discussed in the context of the multiple potential causes of hyponatremia in an elderly depressed patient, with a focus on fluoxetine-induced SIADH, as reported in 9 other published cases.

Abstract: The author discusses a relatively new syndrome in which toxic hyperserotonergic states can result from the interaction of different classes of antidepressant drugs. He also distinguishes between this "serotonin syndrome" and neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Using case examples, he demonstrates the potential lethality of SS.

Abstract: The objective of this open study was to determine the efficacy and safety of fluoxetine for the treatment of children and adolescents with anxiety disorders.
Twenty-one patients with overanxious disorders, social phobia, or separation anxiety disorder, who were unresponsive to previous psychopharmacological and psychotherapeutic interventions, were treated openly with fluoxetine for up to 10 months. Patients with lifetime histories of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) or panic disorder, or with current major depression, were excluded. Beneficial and adverse effects of fluoxetine were ascertained using the improvement and severity subscales of the Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGIS) in two ways: (1) independent chart reviews by two child psychiatrists and (2) prospective assessments by the treating nurses and the patients' mothers.
Eighty-one percent (n = 17) of patients showed moderate to marked improvement in anxiety symptoms. The severity of anxiety as measured by the CGIS was also significantly reduced from marked to mild (effect size: 2.3). There were no significant side effects.
These results suggest that fluoxetine may be an effective and safe treatment for nondepressed children and adolescents with anxiety disorders other than OCD and panic disorder. Future investigations using double-blind, placebo-controlled methodologies are warranted.

Abstract: Social phobia is a chronic and disabling anxiety disorder. Although its pharmacological treatment has not been extensively studied, recent reports suggest that social phobia may be treated with monoamine oxidase inhibitors, beta-blockers, tricyclic antidepressants, and alprazolam. A recent study has shown that fluoxetine is also effective in social phobia, and preliminary results suggest that the same may apply to other serotonin reuptake inhibitors, too. In this paper we describe the results of citalopram treatment in three patients with social phobia.

Abstract: Suicidal suffocation by forced oxygen depletion (environmental hypoxia) with carbon dioxide (CO2) and with propane is discussed in two cases. No toxicologic proof was available with the former and circumstantial evidence weighed heavily. The latter case demonstrated inhaled propane by an on-scene transthoracic aspirate; all other toxicology specimens, including brain, liver, blood, kidney, fat, and vitreous, did not contain hydrocarbons. This second fatality was complicated by multi-agent overdose, including diphenhydramine, fluoxetine (Prozac), and nordiazepam. The designation of these deaths as due to oxygen depletion involved careful scrutiny of the autopsy, toxicologic, and scene findings. Complete analysis of all factors surrounding these rarely encountered suffocation deaths is stressed.

Abstract: Carotid sinus hypersensitivity can be a cause of recurrent unexplained syncope in the older patient. Dual chamber cardiac pacing may relieve the bradycardia, but may not affect the vasodilatory component of this disorder. We report on two patients with carotid sinus hypersensitivity with a predominant vasodilatory component who experienced recurrent syncope following permanent pacemaker implantation. Both patients were treated with serotonin reuptake inhibitors and after 4-6 weeks of therapy had complete resolution of symptoms. We conclude that serotonin reuptake inhibitors may be useful in the treatment of recurrent syncope due to carotid sinus hypersensitivity resistant to dual chamber cardiac pacing.

Abstract: This case study is of a young man with childhood onset of severe obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). The patient had no clinical improvement during therapeutic trials of clomipramine, fluoxetine, and fluvoxamine, including buspirone augmentation. The patient consumed 50 tablets of fluoxetine in a suicide attempt and experienced a total remission of his OCD symptoms for the first time in his life. This remission lasted approximately 1 month and raises interesting questions about the mechanism of action of the serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Subsequently, the patient was able to achieve a 75% improvement in symptomatology when treated with a combination of fluoxetine and clonazepam. This open report suggests that clonazepam may be an effective augmentation agent to a serotonin reuptake inhibitor in the treatment of OCD.

Abstract: Sneezing or sternutation is usually the physiologic response to nasal irritation. The reflex follows a very complicated pathway requiring coordinated communication between the trigeminal and nervous terminalis afferent impulses as well as from glottic and inspiratory muscles in the efferent limb. When the reflex pathway is unbalanced, sneezing can increase in frequency and severity to the extent that some patients become disabled. We present the clinical examination, differential diagnosis, and treatment modalities for the case of an adolescent male who experienced debilitating intractable sneezing for more than one year. As for many of the patients described with this elusive diagnosis, our patient appears to have a functional etiology.

Abstract: We describe three patients, all meeting DSM-III-R criteria for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), whose vivid, intrusive obsessional images had been diagnosed by previous treatment personnel as "flashbacks" of repressed childhood trauma. All three patients had been urged to engage in psychotherapy to "uncover" their putative repressed memories. However, serotonin reuptake antagonists produced prompt remission of the images and the associated obsessional and compulsive symptoms in all cases. It may be that in some patients, so-called flashbacks instead represent the very common obsessional images of OCD.

Abstract: A case of fluoxetine induced dyskinesia in an elderly woman with previous use of low dose haloperidol is described. In contrast to neuroleptic induced tardive dyskinesia it was characterised by a rapid onset after commencing fluoxetine and rapid resolution on cessation. In the case discussion we describe other cases of fluoxetine induced extrapyramidal syndromes and possible mechanisms.

Abstract: A 61-year-old man with presumed Pick's disease was successfully treated with fluoxetine for pathological affect. Severe intermittent, rhythmically repetitive trains of myoclonus developed suddenly the following year. A dystonic-like component involving the shoulder region and a decrescendo frequency pattern were observed. Myoclonus involved the face, palate, shoulder, neck, upper chest and back, diaphragm, hips, and upper extremities, especially on the right side. Movements were not influenced by postural adjustments, startle, or other stimuli. Movements proved insensitive to benztropine but abated with discontinuation of fluoxetine. Rechallenge with fluoxetine or trazodone evoked the movements, whereas clonazepam and chloral hydrate abolished the movements. The pattern of myoclonus is unlike previous reported cases and may relate to activation of serotonin 5HT1A receptors (possibly supersensitive in Pick's disease) or to hypodopaminergia. Although fluoxetine may be useful as adjunct therapy in dementing disorders, caution may be warranted in its use in Pick's disease.

Abstract: State-of-the-art psychosocial treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder is based on behavior therapy strategies and techniques with adjunctive pharmacological treatment. The critical therapeutic element is the prolonged confrontation of the individual with the stimuli that provokes obsessive thoughts or compulsive actions, without the individual then engaging in cognitive or ritualistic avoidance behaviors. For the clinician, a decision model for treating this disorder is drawn from recent behavioral and pharmacological research, as well as from the individual's self-help capacities. Judicious use of currently available treatments can reduce suffering and restore lost psychosocial functioning in obsessive-compulsive patients and their families.

Abstract: We evaluated fluoxetine in six patients with poorly controlled cataplexy by beginning patients on a single 20 mg dose without any change in their current medications. Once benefit occurred, we discontinued or reduced other anticataplectic medication. Reduction in the number of cataplectic episodes per week after 20 weeks of treatment constituted the basis for efficacy determination. Patients experienced a mean reduction of 92% (a mean drop in frequency of 21.7 to 1.7 episodes per week). Although fluoxetine-induced headache occurred in one patient, the other five reported no side effects at the doses used. The results of this pilot study demonstrate that fluoxetine safely and effectively suppresses cataplexy and reduces the need for other, less desirable, anticataplectic agents.

Abstract: To review reports of the association between fluoxetine and hyponatraemia.
Reports of hyponatraemia associated with fluoxetine received over a four-year period in the New Zealand Intensive Medicines Monitoring Programme have been examined and these and other case reports in the literature, discussed.
Seven patients, all women aged 68-88 years on fluoxetine 20 mg daily, developed hyponatraemia (serum sodium 114-128 mmol/L, five within 19 days of commencement of fluoxetine. The reported rate for women over 65 years was 8.5 per thousand. Withdrawal of fluoxetine was associated with recovery in all cases.
Fluoxetine is associated with a significant incidence of hyponatraemia in the elderly, especially during the first weeks of therapy. It is advisable to monitor electrolytes in older patients during this period.

Abstract: Trichotillomania is a disorder of compulsive hair pulling that often results in alopecia. The clinical features include the pulling of hair from the scalp, eyebrows, and eyelashes, sometimes symmetrically; pubic and other bodily hair may also be plucked. The disorder is present in 0.6% of college students. The majority of sufferers who seek treatment are female, with usual age of onset between 11 and 16 years. Trichotillomania can occur in a wide variety of psychiatric disorders, and patients with the condition may be more likely to have a lifetime diagnosis of depression or an anxiety, eating, or substance abuse disorder. Although empirically derived treatment guidelines are still lacking, the current literature suggests that behavior therapy and pharmacotherapy are the most efficacious treatments for adult trichotillomania. Controlled trials with pharmacotherapy (clomipramine) have shown significant reductions in hair pulling over the short term. Controlled investigations of behavior therapy have not been conducted, but several treatment series suggest efficacy. At least three reports also suggest that behavior therapy and pharmacotherapy bring some improvement in childhood trichotillomania, although this has not been empirically studied. A case illustrating the combination of behavior therapy techniques and pharmacotherapy in the treatment of trichotillomania is presented.

Abstract: A 19-year-old man who attempted suicide by ingesting approximately 600 mg fluoxetine (Prozac) and 140 mg loxapine (Loxitane) had two episodes of atrial flutter shortly thereafter. Admission serum fluoxetine, norfluoxetine, and loxapine levels were 1,053 ng/mL, 702 ng/mL, and 40 ng/mL, respectively. This case of atrial flutter in association with an overdose of either of these drugs demonstrates the potential for cardiotoxicity with these agents in the overdose setting. Theoretical mechanisms of cardiotoxicity are presented.

Abstract: Antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction is a common and significant cause of patient distress and noncompliance with treatment. A number of adjunctive pharmacologic strategies, including yohimbine, cyproheptadine, bethanechol, and amantadine, have been employed previously. We report a case of using bupropion to treat fluoxetine-induced sexual dysfunction in a 50-year-old man with a history of recurrent major depression. This is the first case of such treatment we know. Sexual dysfunction induced by fluoxetine is thought secondary to effects on the serotonin system. Bupropion is an antidepressant with minimal sexual side effects. The mechanism by which bupropion resolved this sexual dysfunction is unknown, but it may be related to its mild dopamine uptake blockade.

Abstract: Enantiomers of thioridazine (TRZ) were determined in postmortem tissues obtained from a patient on chronic TRZ therapy by sequential achiral and chiral high pressure liquid chromatography. Tissue concentrations of (+)-TRZ found in liver, brain, bile and blood were: 6.46, 0.40, 0.48 and 0.07 mg/l or mg/kg, respectively. Concentrations of (-)-TRZ in liver, brain, bile and blood were: 12.2, 0.81, 1.07 and 0.20 mg/l or mg/kg, respectively. These data demonstrate the stereoselective disposition of TRZ in human tissues.

Abstract: In this report, we describe the abuse of fluoxetine (an antidepressant) in two patients who had histories of substance abuse.
Specific details of the stimulant effects of fluoxetine, used in excessive dosages and in conjunction with other drugs, are discussed.
After hospitalization, our two patients were able to discontinue use of fluoxetine and had improved mentation.
Although the mechanism for this phenomenon is unknown, we postulate that drug craving and behavioral factors are involved.

Abstract: Although panic disorder is generally responsive to single antidepressant pharmacotherapy, a substantial percentage of patients fail either to respond adequately or to maintain a therapeutic response.
The authors report on seven consecutive openly treated patients with panic disorder who showed inadequate antipanic responses to treatment regimens including either a tricyclic (TCA) or fluoxetine. Those patients taking a TCA had fluoxetine added and those patients taking fluoxetine had a TCA added.
All seven patients showed an improvement in antipanic response to the combination treatment.
The current case series is the first, to our knowledge, to suggest that the combination of a TCA and fluoxetine may provide a viable pharmacotherapeutic option for panic disorder patients who have failed to respond to an adequate trial of either a TCA or fluoxetine. Appropriate controlled studies are recommended.

Abstract: A preliminary trial with fluoxetine, a 5-HT reuptake inhibitor, was carried out on two young male patients (21 and 32 years old) affected by Gilles de la Tourette syndrome. They both underwent a complete neurological evaluation also including neuroradiological, neurophysiological and neuropsychological assessment. Both patients had already been treated with benzodiazepines and amitriptyline; the older one was also given haloperidol and chlorimipramine with definite, but short-lasting improvement. During hospitalization a therapeutic trial with fluoxetine (20 mg/day in the younger patient and 40 mg/day in the older) in association with chlorimipramine (75 mg/day) was initiated, leading to a significant reduction (at least 50%) of abnormal movements and obsessive-compulsive behaviour. The older patient had no side effects while the 21 year old subject complained of insomnia, urinary retention and anorexia; despite the objective improvement, these side effects led us to modify the therapy after the first month. The favourable action of serotoninergic agents on TS symptoms supports the hypothesis that the multiple tics of the syndrome are motor compulsions.

Abstract: A 39-year-old woman presented with typical panic disorder symptoms of two years duration. Imipramine (IMI) treatment yielded complete remission of her symptoms for three years. At that time, however, her symptoms recurred. Neither increasing the IMI dose nor an adequate trial of fluoxetine controlled her symptoms. Further history revealed subtle changes in her symptoms suggestive of complex partial seizures. Scalp EEG was normal, but an MRI revealed multiple meningiomas. Her symptoms remitted completely on carbamazepine. This case illustrates the phenomenologic overlap between panic attacks and complex partial seizures, and a neuroanatomic overlap between the two syndromes is hypothesized.

Abstract: Some patients with pathological jealousy have a predominant obsessional component to their jealous thoughts. Since obsessions and compulsions often respond to serotonin reuptake blockers, these agents may also be useful for obsessional jealousy.
We undertook a retrospective study of patients who presented with obsessional jealousy. Six patients were treated in open clinical practice with serotonin reuptake blockers.
Four of the six patients responded to medication. This response was as robust as that seen in patients with classical symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder.
Obsessional jealousy has phenomenological similarities to other obsessions and compulsions, and obsessional jealousy may also respond to standard antiobsessional medications.

Abstract: A 37 year old Chinese man suffered from coexisting narcolepsy and morbid jealousy which were precipitated by head injury 5 years previously. Fluoxetine 20 mg/day reduced his narcoleptic symptoms and morbid jealousy but not his sleepiness. On defaulting treatment, the patient's symptoms and marital problem recurred. A common central serotonin disturbance might be involved in mediating the sleep disorder and associated psychopathology.

Abstract: Low central nervous system (CNS) serotonin levels have been associated with impulsive, aggressive and self-injurious behavior (SIB). Persons with Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) often engage in self-injury by severe compulsive skin picking and gouging and often manifest compulsive eating, hoarding, and explosive outbursts. Some of the compulsive behaviors seen in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) bear similarity to behaviors associated with PWS: Skin picking, trichotillomania, and onychophagia (nail biting). There is abundant evidence that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are effective in treating OCD. Three cases are described in which persons with PWS responded favorably to SSRI treatment. Two persons showed a significant decrease in skin picking. The third case showed a significant decrease in hoarding and explosive outbursts. Strategies are discussed for investigating the possibility of a shared neurochemical basis for the self-injurious, aggressive, and compulsive behaviors in persons with PWS. PWS may provide a relatively homogenous model for the study of skin picking and explosive outbursts among other populations.

Abstract: The correlation between high serum tricyclic antidepressant concentrations and central nervous system side effects has been well established. Only a few reports exist, however, on the relationship between the serum concentrations of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and their toxic effects. In some cases, a high serum concentration of citalopram (> 600 nmol/L) in elderly patients has been associated with increased somnolence and movement difficulties. Widespread cognitive disorders, such as delirium, have not been previously linked with high blood levels of SSRIs. In this report, we describe a patient with acute hyperkinetic delirium connected with a high serum total fluoxetine (fluoxetine plus desmethylfluoxetine) concentration.

Abstract: A case of fluoxetine toxicity in a newborn of 38 weeks' gestation has been presented. The total drug concentration in cord blood was 80 ng/mL. The fluoxetine level, 26 ng/mL, is below the adult therapeutic level; the norfluoxetine cord blood level, 54 ng/mL, is at the adult therapeutic level. At 96 hours the fluoxetine level was not measurable and the norfluoxetine level was 55 ng/mL. The parent compound is fluoxetine, which is metabolized in the liver to norfluoxetine. The half-life of fluoxetine is 2 to 3 days, and that of norfluoxetine is 7 to 9 days. Interestingly, in our patient the fluoxetine was absent in the blood at 4 days, but norfluoxetine was present. The most common side effects of Prozac in adult patients involve primarily the central nervous system and include nervousness, tremor, jitteriness, and occasionally seizures. Central nervous system symptoms were most prominent in this newborn. He also had an increased heart rate. Cardiovascular side effects are less prominent in adults who are taking Prozac. The neonate in this case was asymptomatic at 96 hours of age, indicating that the parent compound, fluoxetine, may be the active part of the drug and side effects may be caused by the parent compound.

Abstract: This is a case study of a 6-week-old infant referred for colic whose mother was using fluoxetine hydrochloride and breast feeding the infant. The mother switched to a commercial formula and reported a dramatic decrease in the infant's crying. We asked the mother to feed the infant breast milk from a bottle and she agreed. Throughout the study the mother kept a daily diary of her infant's crying, sleeping, stooling patterns, and feeding problems. Analysis of the mother's breast milk showed concentrations of 69 ng/mL for fluoxetine and 90 ng/mL for norfluoxetine. Infant blood serum/plasma level was analyzed for fluoxetine hydrochloride following return to breast milk. The concentrations were 340 ng/mL for fluoxetine and 208 ng/mL for norfluoxetine. The diary records showed increased crying, decreased sleep, increased vomiting, and watery stools when fluoxetine hydrochloride was transmitted through breast feeding or breast milk in bottle. These symptoms were reduced when the infant was formula fed. We suggest a possible relationship between colic and associated symptoms and fluoxetine hydrochloride in maternal breast milk.

Abstract: Nocturnal bruxism (tooth clenching and/or grinding during sleep) affects a significant proportion of the population. Its etiology remains uncertain, and no entirely satisfactory treatment is available.
This is an observational report of four depressed individuals selected from one psychiatrist's practice within an urban hospital's psychopharmacology clinic. Psychiatric diagnoses were made according to DSM-III-R criteria. Nocturnal bruxism was determined on the basis of dental examination and/or self-reported nocturnal tooth clenching and/or grinding.
Four patients developed nocturnal bruxism within 2 to 4 weeks after initiation of treatment with fluoxetine or sertraline. Bruxism remitted in all patients after a decrease in antidepressant dosage (N = 1) or addition of buspirone (N = 3).
These observations, which should be confirmed by a controlled study, suggest an association between serotonin selective reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) treatment and the onset or exacerbation of nocturnal bruxism. In addition, they suggest that a decrease in SSRI dosage or the addition of buspirone may relieve SSRI-associated nocturnal bruxism.

Abstract: The primary objective of this article is to review information pertinent to and emphasize the seriousness of a potential adverse monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI)-serotonin uptake inhibitor interaction by considering, within the context of preclinical data, clinical cases in which an MAOI and fluoxetine hydrochloride, a specific serotonin uptake inhibitor, were administered in close temporal proximity. Clinical cases were identified by a review of spontaneous adverse event reports submitted voluntarily to Eli Lilly and Company through its drug surveillance program and by a review of reports of MAOI interactions published in the scientific literature. A discussion of eight selected clinical cases of acute adverse reactions (seven with fatal outcomes; one with a favorable response after cyproheptadine therapy) reported to Eli Lilly and Company in which an MAOI was initiated concurrently or shortly after the discontinuation of fluoxetine and a review of preclinical data suggest a possible role of serotonin and/or serotonin-dopamine interactions in the hypermetabolic state that may occur when a serotonin uptake inhibitor and an MAOI are coadministered, although alternative etiologic processes are possible as well. Data reviewed reinforce the idea that the administration of an MAOI in close temporal proximity to fluoxetine is contraindicated.

Abstract: Drugs with antidopaminergic properties and those capable of stimulating serotonin release can be responsible for hyperthermia syndromes such as neuroleptic malignant syndrome and serotonin syndrome. Dopamine and serotonin are important neurotransmitters in temperature regulation and it is likely that these reactions result from drug-induced changes in neurotransmitter levels. We describe three cases of drug-induced hyperthermia, discuss their aetiology and management, with both general measures and therapies designed to redress neurotransmitter imbalance.

Abstract: Fluoxetine, a highly specific serotonin reuptake inhibitor, has been reported to cause sexual dysfunction in a minority of patients. Although priapism has been associated with other serotonergic antidepressants, no published reports have correlated restoration of sexual potency with use of fluoxetine.
The case histories of three geriatric patients treated with fluoxetine for depression or obsessive compulsive disorder are presented.
Three patients with histories of impotence experienced a return of sexual potency after treatment with fluoxetine. In two of the cases, the patients had documented histories of vascular disease, which their internists had identified as the cause of their impotence. The improvement in sexual response was seemingly unrelated to abatement of depression or obsessive compulsive disorder, and there was no description of priapism by any of the patients.
Sexual side effects of fluoxetine may be more variable than previously thought. Animal models showing paradoxical or opposing responses to serotonin-enhancing agents may apply to human sexual functioning as well.

Abstract: Sleep-related eating disorders distinct from daytime eating disorders have recently been shown to be associated with sleepwalking (SW), periodic limb movement (PLM) disorder and triazolam abuse in a series of 19 adults. We now report eight other primary or combined etiologies identified by clinical evaluations and polysomnographic monitoring of 19 additional adults (mean age 40 years; 58% female): i) obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), with eating during apnea-induced confusional arousals (n = 3); ii) OSA-PLM disorder (n = 1); iii) familial SW and sleep-related eating (n = 2); iv) SW-PLM disorder (n = 1); v) SW-irregular sleep/wake pattern disorder (n = 1); vi) familial restless legs syndrome and sleep-related eating (n = 2); vii) anorexia nervosa with nocturnal bulimia (n = 2) and viii) amitriptyline treatment of migraines (n = 1). In our cumulative series of 38 patients (excluding six with simple obesity from daytime overeating), 44% were overweight (i.e. > 20% excess weight) from sleep-related eating. Nightly sleep-related binge eating (without hunger or purging) had occurred in 84% of patients. Onset of sleep-related eating was also closely linked with i) acute stress involving reality-based concerns about the safety of family members or about relationship problems (n = 6), ii) abstinence from alcohol and opiate/cocaine abuse (n = 2) and iii) cessation of cigarette smoking (n = 2). Current treatment data indicate a primary role of dopaminergic agents (carbidopa/L-dopa; bromocriptine), often combined with codeine and clonazepam, in controlling most cases involving SW and/or PLM disorder. Fluoxetine was effective in two of three patients. Nasal continuous positive airway pressure therapy controlled sleep-related eating in two OSA patients.

Abstract: Complete recovery of phantom limb pain of five years' duration occurred in a 71-year-old man following treatment with fluoxetine. There was no coexisting affective disorder. Further research is indicated in view of the postulated role of lowered central 5-hydroxytryptamine activity in the genesis and maintenance of chronic pain.

Abstract: The case discussed is of a 9-year-old boy with a diagnosis of Prader-Willi, compulsive eating, severe skin picking, mild mental retardation, and behavioral problems. Prehospital, hospital, and posthospital course is reviewed. An approach using fluoxetine and naltrexone shows a marked improvement in weight control, skin picking, and behavior. Obesity and self-mutilation are discussed with regard to the use of fluoxetine and naltrexone.

Abstract: Dysfunction of the serotonergic system has been implicated in the development and maintenance of self-injury in some persons with mental retardation. Several preliminary reports have suggested that fluoxetine, a drug that blocks the reuptake of serotonin, may decrease self-injury in these individuals. Of the 44 cases of self-injury treated with fluoxetine and previously reported in the literature, 42 demonstrated a beneficial response to the drug. We report four additional cases of adults with mental retardation whose self-injury was treated with fluoxetine. Each of these individuals benefited from fluoxetine to some extent, with average decreases in self-injury ranging from 20% to 88% when compared with baseline levels. These findings, combined with those from previously published case studies, emphasize the need for well-controlled studies to more adequately assess the effects of fluoxetine on self-injury.

Abstract: We report a case of painful priapism of the clitoris lasting 24 hours, which was believed to be pathophysiologically associated with the administration of trazodone hydrochloride. Drug-induced unusual erectile activity in the clitoris has been described previously. However, to our knowledge this is the first reported case of drug-induced priapism of the clitoris. Management involved discontinuation of the offending agents and administration of adrenergic agonists to induce clitoral smooth muscle contraction. Clitoral function, proposed to be the ability to engorge and enable extrusion of the glans clitoris, was not obviously adversely affected by the priapistic episode.

Abstract: The use of fluoxetine to treat chronic depression and associated self-injurious behaviour (SIB) in a woman with severe mental retardation and a man with profound mental retardation is reported. In the first case, behavioural monitoring of treatment response revealed a dramatic decrease in SIB and a normalization of the woman's sleep disturbance. In the second case, SIB and the use of mechanical restraint decreased substantially. In both cases, anecdotal reports also indicated a diminution of other depressive symptoms. These cases highlight the need to consider an affective disorder as a cause of SIB in persons with severe and profound developmental disabilities. The behaviour monitoring system proved to be a practical aid in the diagnosis of depression and evaluation of antidepressant treatment in individuals who were incapable of self-report.

Abstract: To describe a case of tics associated with fluoxetine.
A depressed adolescent was treated with fluoxetine. The patient had not been exposed to any other pharmacologic agents prior to this treatment. Following eight months of fluoxetine therapy the patient developed numerous tics. The movements subsided six months after discontinuation of fluoxetine.
Antidopaminergic effects have been reported in patients treated with fluoxetine. Because fluoxetine is a specific serotonin reuptake inhibitor, one plausible explanation for the extrapyramidal symptoms observed in these patients is that serotonin modulates dopaminergic neurons.
Extrapyramidal symptoms have been reported in patients receiving fluoxetine, although never previously in an adolescent. This case report provides further evidence that fluoxetine may be associated with severe extrapyramidal adverse reactions.

Abstract: To report a case of possible fluoxetine-induced syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH).
A 92-year-old patient was prescribed oral fluoxetine 20 mg daily for depression. After 13 days of therapy, she developed severe weakness and was found to have hyponatremia. Fluoxetine was discontinued. Treatment included fluid restriction and sodium chloride and potassium supplementation. Eight days after admission, the hyponatremia resolved and the patient was discharged without any pharmacologic treatment for depression.
Case reports on fluoxetine-induced SIADH were reviewed. Fluoxetine-associated SIADH appears to occur most commonly after short-term therapy in elderly patients. Resolution of hyponatremia occurs six days to two weeks after discontinuation of fluoxetine.
Geriatric patients receiving fluoxetine should be monitored regularly to detect abnormal electrolyte values.

Abstract: (+/-)3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), a synthetic amphetamine derivative used recreationally by humans, damages brain serotonin neurons in experimental animals. In preclinical studies, serotonin reuptake inhibitors block MDMA-induced serotonin release; they also block MDMA neurotoxicity. Whether serotonin reuptake inhibitors also block MDMA's psychoactive effects in humans has not been established. Reported herein are four individuals who describe their experiences after ingesting fluoxetine, a potent and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, before MDMA ingestion. Their reports indicate that fluoxetine does not block MDMA's reinforcing subjective effects and raise the possibility that MDMA's psychoactive effects may be separable from its neurotoxic actions.

Abstract: We report the benefits of clomipramine-fluoxetine combination in four cases of severe obsessive compulsive disorder. In two cases, the combination was effective when either drug used singly was ineffective. In the other two cases, fluoxetine adjunct produced benefits with no additional side effects.

Abstract: A fifteen-year-old girl with a two-year history of severe neurotic excoriations and an obsessive-compulsive disorder experienced a dramatic improvement of her neurotic excoriations after a six-week course of fluoxetine 20 mg per day. This is in contrast to most previously reported treatments, which typically were only moderately effective. The neurobiological basis for the efficacy of fluoxetine, an antidepressant that is a potent serotonin reuptake inhibitor, in the treatment of neurotic excoriations associated with an obsessive-compulsive disorder, is reviewed.

Abstract: Interferon-alpha is the only approved and effective treatment for hepatitis C. Psychiatric side effects are common and have frequently required a decrease in dose or discontinuation of therapy. We here report a case of interferon-alpha-induced depression in a 40-yr-old man with hepatitis C successfully treated with the antidepressant fluoxetine, which allowed completion of interferon treatment.

Abstract: Potent inhibition of cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) in human liver microsomes by fluoxetine and its major metabolite norfluoxetine was confirmed (apparent inhibition constant values, 0.2 mumol/L). Several other serotonergic agents were also found to be competitive inhibitors of this genetically polymorphic enzyme. The O-demethylation ratio of dextromethorphan that expressed CYP2D6 activity in 19 patients receiving fluoxetine fell in the region of the antimode separating the O-demethylation ratio values observed in 208 extensive metabolizers from 15 poor metabolizers of a control group of healthy subjects. Inhibition of CYP2D6 activity in patients undergoing treatment with fluoxetine or other serotonin uptake inhibitors could contribute to toxicity or attenuated response from concurrent medications that are substrates of this enzyme. Other in vitro studies indicated that CYP2D6 catalyzes the O-demethylation of oxycodone to form oxymorphone. This reaction was inhibited by fluoxetine and its normetabolite in liver microsomes from both extensive and poor metabolizer individuals, indicating that these compounds are not selective inhibitors of CYP2D6 activity.

Abstract: The history of the treatment of anorexia nervosa includes the majority of psychological and somatic therapies devised by psychiatrists, psychologists, and general physicians. We review the history of one of these treatments, electrical convulsive therapy (ECT), and discuss three patients treated with ECT for primary anorexia nervosa. Two had a positive response to this treatment, one did not. She later responded favorably to a course of treatment with fluoxetine.

Abstract: After major depression was diagnosed in a 83-year-old woman, fluoxetine was prescribed. Six days later she became delirious and weak, necessitating hospitalization. She was found to have hyponatremia secondary to fluoxetine-induced syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). Recovery was complete after discontinuation of the medication.

Abstract: Fluoxetine has been reported to have interactions with antipsychotics and other antidepressants with symptoms of toxicity of these drugs. We report a case of a possible interaction with pimozide which led to a potentially life threatening bradycardia. Careful monitoring should be done when these two drugs are prescribed at the same time, especially in the elderly and in patients with cardiac disease.

Abstract: In a depressed patient, the addition of citalopram 40-60 mg per day to treatment with amitriptyline 75 mg per day had no effect on the plasma levels of amitriptyline and nortriptyline, but it led to clinical improvement without the appearance of adverse effects. This and similar findings in four other patients comedicated with citalopram and amitriptyline (2 patients), clomipramine or maprotiline suggest that citalopram differs from other selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, such as fluvoxamine and fluoxetine, which have been shown to increase tricyclic antidepressant plasma levels.

Abstract: To determine the efficacy of fluoxetine in the treatment of social phobia, fluoxetine was administered to 16 patients with a primary DSM-III-R diagnosis of social phobia in a 12-week, open, clinical trial.
Treatment began at 20 mg of fluoxetine daily and was increased according to clinical response and side effects every 4 weeks. Patients completed self-report measures of anxiety and depression at baseline and at Weeks 4, 8, and 12. These included the Beck Depression Inventory, the Social Avoidance and Distress Scale, the Fear of Negative Evaluation Scale, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, the Fear Questionnaire, the Social Anxiety Thoughts Questionnaire, and the Social Adjustment Scale-Self-Report. Clinicians completed a Clinical Global Improvement Scale.
Thirteen of the 16 patients completed the trial. Three patients (18.8%) were unable to complete the trial due to adverse side effects. Of the 13 (81.2%) remaining patients, 10 were considered to be responders and 3 were considered to be nonresponders. Measures of social anxiety and phobic avoidance showed a significant improvement from baseline to endpoint, achieving a significance of p < .005. Responders to fluoxetine were more likely to have been older at onset of the social phobic symptoms and had a shorter duration of illness.
These findings suggest that fluoxetine may be effective in the treatment of social phobia. Double-blind studies will be required to further investigate these findings.

Abstract: Depression is a major clinical feature of Parkinson's disease. We report the increased amount of motor disability in four patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease after exposure to the antidepressant fluoxetine. The possibility of a clinically relevant dopamine-antagonistic capacity of fluoxetine in Parkinson's disease patients must be considered.

Abstract: This paper illustrates the advantages of time series analysis in documenting treatment effects through a case study of a trial of fluoxetine in a borderline woman being treated in a long-term inpatient unit for severe personality disorders. Data consisted of weekly self-reports of symptomatology over 58 weeks of hospitalization. Intervention analysis carried out after the patient was discharged documented the effectiveness of the medication and the differential timing of response in individual symptoms.

Abstract: The case of a ten-year-old boy with a two-year history of trichotillomania and depression is presented. Imipramine was unsuccessful in treating trichotillomania and showed limited success in alleviating depression. Treatment with low-dosage fluoxetine (10 mg daily) led to marked improvement of both trichotillomania and depression.

Abstract: To document the development of abnormal hemostasis in a patient treated with fluoxetine.
A 49-year-old man developed a release-type defect in platelet aggregation during treatment with fluoxetine. Abnormal platelet aggregation was observed during platelet viability testing, in which adenosine diphosphate, epinephrine, ristocetin, arachidonic acid, and collagen were used as agonists. Two days after the withdrawal of fluoxetine, platelet function returned to normal.
Fluoxetine is an antidepressant that is thought to act through inhibition of serotonin reuptake in the central nervous system. Fluoxetine also inhibits the reuptake of serotonin in platelets, significantly decreasing granular storage and potentially influencing platelet aggregation characteristics. Clinical manifestations of abnormal platelet function have been reported in association with fluoxetine therapy.
The rapid normalization of platelet aggregation after the withdrawal of fluoxetine in this patient does not conform to the known clinical pharmacokinetics of norfluoxetine. The half-life of fluoxetine is shorter, suggesting that the parent drug (rather than norfluoxetine) was the causative agent. Serum fluoxetine and norfluoxetine concentrations were not measured in this patient.

Abstract: Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is characterized by hypotonia at birth, hypogonadism, early childhood obesity, and mental deficiency. Other behavioral symptoms that become prominent during adolescence and adulthood include temper outbursts, stealing and hoarding food, and skin picking. The self-excoriating skin picking behavior observed in individuals with PWS is quite common and can lead to persistent sores and infections, even requiring hospitalization.
Two patients with PWS who displayed repetitive, self-mutilatory behavior of skin picking are described. They were both treated successfully with different doses of fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor.
The skin-picking behavior in patients with PWS may be a variant of the spectrum of obsessive-compulsive disorders. Obsessive-compulsive disorders have been successfully treated with serotonin reuptake inhibitors such as fluoxetine. Thus, fluoxetine may be considered an option in the management of skin-picking behavior in patients with PWS.

Abstract: We report on a 32-year old woman with bulimia nervosa treated with fluoxetine for depression. Fluoxetine is the only drug currently recommended for the treatment of bulimia. The patient became severely disturbed with tension, irritability, self-damage by cutting and violent, intense, suicidal and paranoid ideation qualitatively different to previous symptoms in the course of her illness. Clinical impression was of a striking association between fluoxetine and these symptoms. We suggest caution when using fluoxetine in bulimic patients with depression who have additional impulsive behaviours such as self-cutting, alcohol and/or drug abuse and shop-lifting.

Abstract: Treatment of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) with serotonin reuptake blockers has been demonstrated effective in 50% to 60% of patients in open and placebo-controlled studies. However, some reports indicate that comorbid Axis II psychopathology, including avoidant personality disorder, and deficiency of social skills could be predictors of a poor response to treatment in OCD patients.
A retrospective review elicited 12 patients who met DSM-III-R diagnostic criteria for both OCD and social phobia and were treated in our clinic last year with adequate trials of serotonin reuptake blockers or MAOIs.
Only 3 (27%) of the 11 patients treated with serotonin reuptake blockers had a substantial improvement of OCD symptoms. Among them, only 1 (11%) of 9 patients with generalized subtype of social phobia versus 2 (100%) of 2 patients with the nongeneralized subtype responded to serotonin reuptake blockers. Four (80%) of 5 patients with comorbid generalized social phobia receiving phenelzine had marked improvement of OCD symptoms. In general, response of social phobia occurred parallel to that of OCD.
Comorbid generalized social phobia seems to be associated with a poor response to serotonin reuptake blockers in OCD patients. Deficient social skills, as well as distinct biological mechanisms, may be involved. MAOIs might be an effective alternative medication in refractory cases. Larger and controlled studies are needed to define the implications of the association of OCD and social phobia.

Abstract: The absence of relevant human research studies of hallucinogenic drugs has not curtailed their unsupervised use. Two cases are presented that suggest decreased sensitivity to the serotonergic hallucinogens psilocybin and LSD induced by drugs with effects on serotonergic neurotransmission, allopurinol and fluoxetine. These reports suggest that hallucinogens' effects in humans are mediated by serotonergic receptors.

Abstract: To examine the relationship between the syndromes of elective mutism and social phobia, a case of elective mutism associated with social phobia in a 12-year-old girl is presented, and the clinical literature regarding the syndrome of elective mutism is reviewed. Elective mutism or reluctance to speak in unfamiliar social situations may be a symptom of social phobia. Social anxiety is a nearly universal characteristic of children manifesting the syndrome of elective mutism. Elective mutism may respond to treatment with medications that also are effective in the treatment of social phobia. Elective mutism may be a manifestation of social phobia rather than a separate diagnostic syndrome. Pharmacologic treatment may be effective.

Abstract: Pathologic laughing or crying (PLC), a complication of many neurologic disorders, involves behavior that is either inappropriate to the context or to the patient's subjective feeling state. It is due to a dysregulation of the motoric components of emotional experience. PLC is distinct from, but often associated with, major depression. The relatively few reports on treatment of PLC are primarily with tricyclic antidepressants. We report the effective treatment of PLC due to stroke in three patients with nortriptyline or fluoxetine. The cases also illustrate the broad spectrum of depressive symptoms (from none to a major depression) seen in patients with PLC. We discuss treatment implications and directions for future research.

Abstract: Eight cases of resistant recurrent depression were treated with a combination of nortriptyline and a new serotonin reuptake inhibitor, with or without concurrent lithium therapy. Significant improvement was seen in all patients where other drug regimes and ECT had been ineffective. No adverse reactions occurred in any of our patients, seven of whom were elderly. The combination treatment was more effective than individual therapies alone.

Abstract: In general, effective treatments for trichotillomania have been elusive. Although behavioral therapies and hypnosis have provided benefits to some, adult patients with chronic hair pulling have often proved refractory to treatment. Medication has generally been unhelpful until the recent introduction of serotonin reuptake inhibitors for the treatment of this condition. Furthermore, there has been little systematic study of the clinical characteristics of these patients.
Twenty individuals with trichotillomania were interviewed and were characterized on the basis of hair-pulling patterns, comorbidity, obsessionality, and the presence of symptoms of depression and anxiety. Twelve patients participated in an open 16-week trial of fluoxetine (up to 80 mg/day).
Compared with baseline scores derived from a scale of trichotillomania severity, severity scores at endpoint decreased (improved) by 34% (p less than .025). Among the 8 responders, the mean decrease in severity scores was 60%. Fifty-five percent (11 of 20) had current or past additional DSM-III-R Axis I diagnoses (disorders of mood, anxiety, and psychoactive substance use).
We conclude that in an open 16-week trial, patients treated with fluoxetine improved significantly. Data are presented on comorbid conditions, depressive symptoms, and anxiety. Baseline behavioral assessments of patients with trichotillomania suggest that substantial differences exist between this syndrome and obsessive compulsive disorder.

Abstract: To report a syncopal episode associated with fluoxetine in a young, relatively healthy man.
Single case report.
585-bed private hospital.
A 30-year-old man with hypertension, esophageal ulcers, and syncope of recent onset.
Fluoxetine was started six weeks prior to the syncopal episode in this patient, and is the medication most temporally associated with the event. Because the patient had a normal neurologic examination and electroencephalogram, but an abnormal electrocardiogram on admission and one month after discharge, the syncopal episode was most likely caused by cardiovascular effects of fluoxetine.
Fluoxetine has been reported to cause cardiac conduction abnormalities in otherwise normal individuals. Bradycardia secondary to a direct effect of fluoxetine, or to a drug interaction among fluoxetine, ranitidine, and enalapril is the most likely explanation for this patient's syncopal episode.

Abstract: Symptoms of serotonergic overstimulation may resemble depressive symptoms. Postulating that overmedication with fluoxetine can appear as response failure (as norfluoxetine accumulates), systematic trials of lower doses were conducted in patients who failed to respond despite apparent initial improvements.
Of 23 consecutive outpatients treated with fluoxetine 20 mg/day for DSM-III-R major depression, 4 failed to sustain initial improvements during 4-8 weeks of treatment (in the absence of apparent side effects). In these 4 patients, fluoxetine was withdrawn for 2 weeks, then reinstituted at 20 mg q.o.d. All patients were followed up weekly to monthly (for up to 17 months) and administered the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression.
Four of 4 patients improved during washout and went on to respond to the lower dose. All 4 cases are presented. On review of the literature, fluoxetine fixed-dose studies reveal increased adverse effects with no increase in efficacy at dosages above 5 mg/day and decreased efficacy at dosages above 40 mg/day. Special issues inherent in the study and use of an antidepressant with a 1- to 3-week active half-life are discussed.
Even in the apparent absence of side effects, nonresponse to fluoxetine may be due to overmedication in some patients. Standard doses of fluoxetine may be higher than "optimum." The apparent difficulty distinguishing fluoxetine's adverse effects/toxicity (or a "therapeutic window" effect) from underlying depressive symptoms, taken in conjunction with the 3-9 weeks required to approach steady state, may suggest the option of lowering the dose in some cases of nonresponse or "relapse."

Abstract: An open trial of pharmacological treatment with fluoxetine, ranging from 20 mg every other day to 80 mg per day, led to a significant improvement in Clinical Global Impressions ratings of Clinical Severity in 15 of 23 subjects with autistic disorder and 10 of 16 subjects with mental retardation. Six of 23 patients with autistic disorder and 3 of 16 patients with mental retardation had side effects which significantly interfered with function, consisting predominantly of restlessness, hyperactivity, agitation, decreased appetite, or insomnia. Double-blind studies of the efficacy of pharmacological agents that potently inhibit 5-HT uptake in the treatment of mental retardation coexisting with Axis I psychiatric disorders (especially obsessive-compulsive disorder) and autistic disorder are warranted.

Abstract: Emotional lability or emotionalism is a relatively common phenomenon and frequently occurs following vascular or traumatic brain injury. It is distressing and embarrassing to sufferers and their families, and often interferes with rehabilitation. At present there is no satisfactory or reliable treatment for this condition. We describe an open trial using fluoxetine, a newer antidepressant with a specific serotonergic action, in the treatment of emotional lability due to brain injury. Six consecutive cases of emotional lability attending a rehabilitation unit were studied (five cases of cerebrovascular accident and one of traumatic brain injury). Response to treatment was measured using a modification of the scale described by Lawson and MacLeod [1]. All showed a marked improvement within one week of commencing fluoxetine and the drug was well tolerated with no reported side-effects. The speed of onset and degree of improvement suggest that fluoxetine may be a useful agent in the treatment of emotional lability due to brain injury. Our observations indicate that further investigation of the role of fluoxetine in the treatment of emotional lability is warranted.

Abstract: The clinical polysomnographic (PSG) reports of 2,650 consecutive adults studied during 41 months were reviewed retrospectively to identify all patients treated with fluoxetine or tricyclic antidepressants. The PSG reports of four other adult groups were also reviewed: periodic limb movement (PLM) disorder (n = 28); sleep terror/sleepwalking (ST/SW) (n = 54); rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) (n = 70); patients with clinically unremarkable sleep during two consecutive PSG studies (n = 30). Standard PSG recording and scoring methods were employed. A total of 1.5% (n = 41) and 2.0% (n = 52) of patients were receiving fluoxetine or tricyclics (amitriptyline or nortriptyline, n = 31; imipramine or desipramine, n = 16; protriptyline or trimipramine, n = 5). A selective association between fluoxetine and extensive, prominent eye movements in nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep was detected, utilizing Fisher's exact one-tailed statistic (p less than 0.00001 for each comparison). The detection rates were fluoxetine, 48.8% (20/41); tricyclics, 5.8% (3/52); RBD, 4.3% (3/70); objectively normal sleepers, 3.3% (1/30); PLM, ST/SW, 0% (0/82). These groups had similar mean ages (31.5-45.4 years) and gender distributions (50.0-60.7% male), apart from RBD. The effect of fluoxetine, a potent and specific serotonin reuptake inhibitor, on NREM eye movements is postulated to derive from potentiation of serotonergic neurons that inhibit brainstem "omnipause neurons", which, in turn, inhibit saccadic eye movements, thus resulting in disinhibited release of saccades. In addition, a 31-year-old man with obsessive-compulsive disorder developed RBD soon after starting fluoxetine therapy, which persisted at PSG study 19 months after fluoxetine discontinuation.

Abstract: Preclinical and clinical studies suggest that yohimbine facilitates sexual behavior and may be helpful in the treatment of male impotence. A single case report suggests that yohimbine may be used to treat the sexual side effects of clomipramine. This study evaluated yohimbine as a treatment for the sexual side effects caused by serotonin reuptake blockers.
Six patients with either obsessive compulsive disorder, trichotillomania, anxiety, or affective disorders who suffered sexual side effects after treatment with serotonin reuptake blockers were given yohimbine on a p.r.n. basis in an open clinical trial. Various doses of yohimbine were used to determine the ideal dose for each patient.
Five of the six patients experienced improved sexual functioning after taking yohimbine. One patient who failed to comply with yohimbine treatment had no therapeutic effects. Side effects of yohimbine included excessive sweating, increased anxiety, and a wound-up feeling in some patients.
The results of this study indicate that yohimbine may be an effective treatment for the sexual side effects caused by serotonin reuptake blockers. Future controlled studies are needed to further investigate the effectiveness and safety of yohimbine for this indication.

Abstract: Depersonalization disorder is classified in DSM-III-R (APA 1987) as a dissociative disorder characterized by altered perception or experience of the self. To date, there are no known reports of the neurobiological features of this disorder. We report clinical and biological correlates in a patient with depersonalization disorder previously unresponsive to a variety of anticonvulsant, monoamine oxidase inhibitor, and tricyclic antidepressant trials, but for whom fluoxetine partially reduced depersonalization symptoms, but not associated anxiety and depression. Neurophysiological, neuroanatomical and neuropsychological findings revealed left hemispheric frontal-temporal activation and decreased left caudate perfusion. These findings suggest a similarity to the neuropsychiatric data reported in obsessive-compulsive disorder patients.

Abstract: Depression can result from the discontinuation of high-dose anabolic steroids. Whether this type of depression responds to antidepressants in a manner similar to other types of depression is not clear.
Four patients suffering from anabolic steroid withdrawal depression were treated with fluoxetine.
All four patients responded to fluoxetine in a time course consistent with the response of major depression to antidepressant medications.
Because of the widespread use of anabolic steroids, this type of depression may be more common than realized. Anabolic steroid withdrawal depression should be treated with antidepressant medications. Further study is encouraged.

Abstract: There is some overlap in the phenomenology and treatment response of trichotillomania, Gilles de la Tourette's syndrome (TS), and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). Neuroleptics may play a role in the treatment of TS as well as refractory OCD, and the question arises whether this also holds for trichotillomania.
Patients with trichotillomania were treated in open clinical practice with serotonin reuptake blockers. When symptom resolution was incomplete or symptom relapse occurred, low-dose pimozide was added.
In six out of seven patients, the addition of pimozide to a serotonin reuptake blocker led to an improvement in hair pulling. In patients who were able to tolerate their medication, this response was sustained.
Augmentation of serotonergic agents with dopamine blockers may play a role in the treatment of trichotillomania. Further controlled trials of pimozide augmentation in trichotillomania are needed.

Abstract: Several studies have indicated that patients with panic attacks have a higher rate of suicide attempts as well as deaths from suicide. Additionally, several investigators have presented case reports of individuals manifesting suicidal and violent behaviors directly and temporally associated with panic attacks. We report on four additional cases and suggest that these findings may explain, in part, the increased rate of suicidal behavior among patients with panic attacks found by some investigators. Furthermore, these case reports offer preliminary evidence that the relationship between violent behavior and the panic state may be clinically significant and deserving of further elucidation.

Abstract: Six depressed mentally retarded adults were treated with fluoxetine in an open trial. Five patients significantly improved, and one patient partially improved, after treatment with fluoxetine. Their mean Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score was significantly reduced after treatment. These results suggest that fluoxetine is a safe and effective treatment for depression in mental retardation. Some potential advantages of using fluoxetine in this clinical population are discussed. Additional controlled research studies are needed to confirm these findings.

Abstract: Fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, is gaining increased acceptance in the treatment of adolescent depression. Generally safe and well tolerated by adults, fluoxetine has been reported to induce mania. The cases of five depressed adolescents, 14-16 years of age, who developed mania during pharmacotherapy with fluoxetine, are reported here. Apparent risk factors for the development of mania or hypomania during fluoxetine pharmacotherapy in this population were the combination of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and affective instability; major depression with psychotic features; a family history of affective disorder, especially bipolar disorder; and a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. Further study is needed to determine the optimal dosage and to identify risk factors that increase individual vulnerability to fluoxetine induced mania in adolescents.

Abstract: Fluoxetine is an effective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressant that can fail to alleviate either insomnia or major depression in a substantial minority of depressed patients. Trazodone has been reported to be both an effective nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic for antidepressant-associated insomnia and a possible serotonergic antidepressant adjunct. We present a case series of patients with variable responses when trazodone was added to fluoxetine.
Eight consecutive depressed (DSM-III-R) patients taking fluoxetine were given trazodone either for sleep or as a possible antidepressant potentiator.
Three (37.5%) of the eight patients (confidence interval = 4.0%-71.0%) had improvements in both sleep and depression. The remaining five patients either were unaffected by the addition of trazodone to fluoxetine or had intolerable adverse drug reactions.
Trazodone may be an effective hypnotic and antidepressant potentiator when combined with fluoxetine for some patients, but its use may be limited by adverse effects.

Abstract: Adult GM2 gangliosidosis is a rare disorder that often presents with both neurological and psychiatric syndromes. Effective treatment of the psychotic and affective symptoms associated with this disorder has been complicated by poor treatment response and the concern that many psychotropic agents may worsen the underlying gangliosidosis. We report the successful use of electroconvulsive therapy for treatment of severe depression in a young man with adult GM2 gangliosidosis.

Abstract: A number of medications have been reported to induce psoriasis. We report two cases of fluoxetine-related psoriasis and discuss similarities between lithium-, trazodone hydrochloride-, and fluoxetine-induced psoriasis.
Two women being treated for depression with fluoxetine developed psoriasis after 6 and 12 months' exposure. This time frame is clinically similar to that observed with lithium-induced psoriasis.
The occurrence of lithium- and fluoxetine-induced psoriasis may not be random. Both drugs modulate serotonergic function, a factor that may contribute to the pathophysiology of psoriasis. If a patient on acute or long-term fluoxetine therapy develops psoriasis, the drug should be considered as a possible etiologic agent.

Abstract: Triiodothyronine (T3) has been shown to augment the therapeutic effect of tricyclic antidepressants as well as monoamine oxidase inhibitors. In this report, three cases of T3 potentiation of the antidepressant effect of fluoxetine are described. The results suggest that T3 augmentation may be effective with a wide range of antidepressants.

Abstract: Antidepressants have previously been associated with paranoid reactions in psychiatric patients. Five cases of paranoid exacerbation with the serotonin reuptake inhibitors fluoxetine and amitriptyline are reported here. Elements common to these cases included a history of paranoid symptomatology and the concomitant occurrence of depressive and psychotic symptoms. Complicated depressive disorders (including atypicality of course and symptomatology, chronicity, psychosis, bipolarity, and secondary onset in the course of a primary psychosis) may present particular vulnerability to paranoid exacerbations associated with serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Although the pharmacology and neurobiology of paranoia remain cryptic, several mechanisms, including 5HT3 receptor-mediated dopamine release, beta-noradrenergic receptor downregulation, or GABAB receptor upregulation acting in the vicinity of the ventral basal ganglia (possibly in lateral orbitofrontal or anterior cingulate circuits), might apply to this phenomenon. These cases call attention to possible paranoid exacerbations with serotonin reuptake blockers in select patients and raise neurobiological considerations regarding paranoia.

Abstract: The potentiation of fluoxetine by buspirone is described in three cases of treatment-resistant depression. All three patients improved markedly with very few side-effects from the medication. The possibility of synergy between drugs that affect serotonin reuptake inhibition, 5HT1A receptors and 5HT2 receptors is discussed.

Abstract: Two patients suffering from severe obsessive-compulsive disorder which had proven refractory to clomipramine and/or phenelzine treatment were successfully treated with fluoxetine, a new drug with a strong serotonin uptake inhibiting action. Outcome of treatment was measured on psychometric tests including the Leyton Obsessive Inventory, Hopkins Symptom Checklist-90, Beck Depression Inventory, and daily self-reports of the duration and degree of discomfort of their most severe obsessions. The delay in responding to fluoxetine, the continuing improvement even after one year on the drug, and the prompt relapse with abrupt withdrawal of treatment were noted.

Abstract: Considerable controversy exists regarding the relationship between fluoxetine and the emergence of suicidal ideation. Three cases are presented of patients who were reexposed to fluoxetine after having previously made a serious suicide attempt during fluoxetine treatment. All three patients developed severe akathisia during retreatment with fluoxetine and stated that the development of the akathisia made them feel suicidal and that it had precipitated their prior suicide attempts. The akathisia and suicidal thinking abated upon the discontinuation of the fluoxetine or the addition of propranolol. The emergence of suicidal ideation during treatment with fluoxetine may be secondary to the development of akathisia. Gradual increments of fluoxetine dose and the prompt recognition and treatment of akathisia may reduce further the rare occurrence of suicidal ideation during fluoxetine treatment.

Abstract: A 61-year-old woman, a nonsmoker, was admitted to the hospital because of endogenous depression. No concomitant disease, especially kidney or liver dysfunction, was diagnosed. After 9 days of treatment with 125 mg of amitriptyline (AMI) daily, she developed signs of a severe anticholinergic syndrome. Plasma concentrations of AMI (510 ng/ml) and nortriptyline (NOR; 320 ng/ml) were very high and the half-life of AMI was about 120 h. The debrisoquine metabolic ratio was 0.55 and 0.79 on two occasions, which shows that she had no deficiency of cytochrome P450IID6. This result was confirmed with a dextromethorphan test, analysis of restriction fragment length polymorphisms (29/29-kb fragments), and genotyping with allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (homozygous 29 kb wild-type alleles). Patients with high plasma levels of tricyclic antidepressants are usually poor metabolizers of debrisoquine. Before the administration of AMI, our patient was pretreated with fluoxetine. A slowly reversible interaction with fluoxetine or an extremely long-lasting metabolite may be responsible for the long plasma half-life of AMI.

Abstract: Social phobia is emerging as an important cause of psychiatric morbidity. Reasons for this are described, as are clinical issues of importance to social phobia, including the extensive associated distress and disability. The use of phenelzine, atenolol, buspirone, fluoxetine, and moclobemide are described. Diagnostic and transcultural aspects of social phobia are described.

Abstract: Obsessive-compulsive disorder is increasingly recognized in patients of different age groups. Serotonergic agents, such as clomipramine, have been recently found to be useful in the management of this condition. However, unexpected side effects, such as dysphoria, aggressiveness, and paranoid ideation, may occur with therapeutic doses of this compound, as evidenced in the cases of two male adolescents presented here. Possible pathogenetic factors, involving serotonin and serotonin-receptor abnormalities are discussed. Management of these side effects is based on adequate dose reduction and monitorization.

Abstract: Fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake blocker, is an antidepressant medication that has also been shown in open clinical trials and one controlled trial to be effective in the treatment of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). OCD is often complicated by depression, and depressive symptoms may interfere with response to both pharmacologic and behavioral treatments.
We describe pilot data from 10 outpatients who met DSM-III-R criteria for OCD in whom the possibility of a depressive reaction or lack of antidepressant response occurred during an open trial of fluoxetine.
Rapid increase in fluoxetine dose to high doses was associated with depressive symptoms in 6 patients. In 8 patients, improvement in depression was associated with addition of a tricyclic antidepressant to fluoxetine treatment. In 5 patients, both OCD and depressive symptoms improved when the patient was switched to the partially selective serotonin reuptake blocker clomipramine.
This paper serves to alert clinicians to the possibility of a depressive reaction, or lack of antidepressant response, to fluoxetine in OCD patients. This possibility can only be resolved scientifically by adequately controlled experimental trials. If depression occurs, combined fluoxetine and tricyclic treatment, or a switch to a partially selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, may be helpful. Special considerations and side effects of combined fluoxetine-tricyclic treatment are described.

Abstract: Depression in the medically ill is underdiagnosed and undertreated. Fluoxetine would appear promising in this population because of its efficacy and benign side effect profile, but it has not been systematically studied in the medically ill.
The authors report the cases of three seriously medically ill patients, seen in psychiatric consultation while patients on a general medical service, who were treated with fluoxetine for depression. Each was an elderly white female with pulmonary disease and atrial arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation, and each was prescribed diuretics, nitrates, and other cardiac and/or pulmonary agents.
Each patient died within 10 days of beginning fluoxetine treatment, from unexplained causes.
The authors hypothesize that direct cardiac effects mediated by fluoxetine, or other factors, may have been contributory. The effects of fluoxetine on electrolytes, fluoxetine's possible effects on drug levels, and serotonin's effect on the pulmonary system are examined. Other antidepressant agents should be considered in this particular population until further data are available.

Abstract: The sexual side effect of anorgasmia has been reported with a variety of antidepressants, including fluoxetine. Cyproheptadine has been used to counteract these side effects. The authors report two cases of bulimia nervosa in which the serotonin antagonist effect of cyproheptadine appeared to cancel out the therapeutic benefits of the serotonin-specific uptake inhibitor fluoxetine.

Abstract: This paper presents the cases of two patients who suffered from panic disorder with agoraphobia and depression. One had been refractory to alprazolam and tricyclics and to behaviour therapy; she had responded to phenelzine, but due to a weight gain of 50 lbs, had discontinued treatment and she relapsed. The second patient, who also suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder, did not respond to alprazolam, imipramine or to phenelzine, but gained weight (33 lbs) on phenelzine. Both patients responded to fluoxetine 80 mg per day without concomitant weight gain.

Abstract: Borderline personality disorder is characterized by many of the symptoms associated with serotonin dysregulation, including affective lability, suicidal behaviors, and impulsive aggression. These provide an ideal clinical model for studying the treatment of these serious symptom presentations. The recent development of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors such as fluoxetine makes it possible to study the role of serotonin in the etiology of affective and behavioral dyscontrol in borderline personality disorder. In this preliminary medication trial, 5 borderline personality disorder patients with severe symptoms resistant to phenelzine and neuroleptics were treated openly with fluoxetine 20 to 40 mg for 8 weeks, with weekly ratings of symptoms. The findings from this work suggested efficacy for fluoxetine in treating the depressive and impulsive symptoms of refractory patients with borderline personality disorder.

Abstract: Combined fluoxetine-tricyclic medication has been recommended for patients who are partial responders or nonresponders to tricyclic medication alone. Three cases were encountered in which the addition of fluoxetine to tricyclic medication resulted in toxic, potentially dangerous elevations in tricyclic blood level, amounting to approximately 100-300% increases over recent tricyclic levels. In reducing the tricyclic dosage after fluoxetine, blood level decreases were behind dosage decreases; and blood level and dosage decreases were not well correlated with each other. Symptoms associated with toxic levels are described. Due to the long half-life of fluoxetine, such increases in tricyclic medication must be anticipated well in advance of initiating treatment with these two compounds. Based on these few cases, a procedure is tentatively recommended for patients on combined fluoxetine-tricyclic regimens, until such time as a definitive regimen can be developed.

Abstract: Although fluoxetine has been shown to be both efficacious and well tolerated, few data are available on the use of this drug in patients with preexisting heart disease and in the elderly. The authors report a case of an elderly patient in whom atrial fibrillation and bradycardia developed shortly after she began treatment with fluoxetine. The dysrhythmias recurred on rechallenge with the drug. A review of the pertinent literature is presented and possible pathophysiologic mechanisms are discussed.
Date: 1991-04-01

Abstract: Three cases are presented in which fluoxetine was employed in the apparently successful treatment of paraphilia, a disorder which has been difficult to treat pharmacologically. Therapeutic benefit may have been related to the efficacy of fluoxetine in the treatment of obsessive compulsive disorders or to direct effects on sexual activity, or both.

Abstract: Three male patients are described in whom anorgasmia developed during treatment with fluoxetine for depression. During attempts to treat the anorgasmia with cyproheptadine, all three patients suffered a relapse of depressive symptoms. The possible mechanism of this effect is discussed in relation to serotonergic systems.

Abstract: A case of a 17-year-old female with a diagnosis of Prader-Willi syndrome, including mild mental retardation, compulsive eating with gross obesity and trichotillomania with trichophagia, is presented. She has a long history of multiple cognitive, behavioral, and psychopharmacological treatments, including several inpatient hospitalizations that had produced only limited success. With the introduction of a fluoxetine trial, she demonstrated a marked improvement in weight control and a moderate improvement in hair pulling over a 6-month period of observation.

Abstract: Self-injurious ideation or behavior appeared de novo or intensified during fluoxetine treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder in six patients, age 10 to 17 years old, who were among 42 young patients receiving fluoxetine for obsessive-compulsive disorder at a university clinical research center. These symptoms required the hospitalization of four patients. Before receiving fluoxetine, four patients had major risk factors for self-destructive behavior including depression or prior suicidal ideation or self-injury. Three hypotheses concerning the apparent association between fluoxetine and these self-injurious phenomena are discussed: (1) coincidence; (2) disorganization of vulnerable individuals secondary to drug-induced activation; and (3) a specific serotonergic-mediated effect on the regulation of aggression.
Date: 1991-03-01

Abstract: The authors report the occurrence of apathy, indifference, inattention, and perseveration in an obsessive compulsive patient taking high doses of fluoxetine. These changes were associated with a decrease in cerebral blood flow in the frontal lobes and changes in neuropsychological tests generally associated with frontal lobe impairment. These clinical manifestations disappeared 4 weeks after discontinuation of fluoxetine.

Abstract: We report the occurrence of supraventricular tachycardia and hypotension in a 54-year-old woman after maintenance therapy with fluoxetine. Although cases of tachycardia and palpitations have been reported, supraventricular tachycardia and hypotension have not been directly attributed to fluoxetine.

Abstract: The authors administered fluoxetine to 11 cocaine-abusing heroin addicts entered in a methadone maintenance program to determine whether it would decrease cocaine craving and use. Three patients discontinued treatment within a few days of initiation because of lack of any acute therapeutic effect. The remaining 8 received fluoxetine for at least 1 week and were followed up over 1 to 6 months. Of these 8, 5 (63%) were successfully treated for cocaine abuse. Three case examples are presented. Fluoxetine may prove a useful addition to the therapeutic armamentarium in the treatment of cocaine abuse.

Abstract: Standard antidepressant drug treatments are unsuccessful in treating up to one-third of depressed patients. The authors describe the utility of combining the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) re-uptake blocker, fluoxetine (Prozac) with a psychostimulant, pemoline (Cylert), for some of these patients.
Date: 1991-01-01

Abstract: The purpose of this article to describe a unique potential side effect of fluoxetine. A case report of a patient with post stroke depression treated with fluoxetine is presented. Fluoxetine was associated temporally with frequent short episodes of sexual excitement described by the patient as feeling like an orgasm. The relationship was dose dependent. Serotonergic medications, like fluoxetine, may induce sexual stimulation as a side effect. The mechanism for this effect is unclear but patients with organic brain disease may be at higher risk for this complication.
Date: 1991-01-01

Abstract: Apathy, indifference, loss of initiative, or disinhibition (without concurrent sedation or hypomania) were observed among five patients receiving the serotonin reuptake blocking antidepressants fluvoxamine or fluoxetine. These effects appeared to be dose related. They disappeared rapidly when the dose of fluvoxamine, which has a short half-life, was reduced. Fluoxetine, which has a long half-life, was more difficult to titrate. A possible relationship between mild drug-induced indifference and the therapeutic effects of serotonin reuptake blocking medication in anxiety disorders is discussed.

Abstract: The authors present a case report of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) in a patient commencing treatment with fluoxetine alone who had previously been treated with several antipsychotic and antidepressant combinations. On reviewing the literature on the pathogenesis of NMS, the authors hypothesize a facilitative role of the neurotransmitter serotonin (5-HT) in conjunction with central dopaminergic blockade in the precipitation of NMS.

Abstract: Several fatalities due to fluoxetine combined with other drugs such as ethyl alcohol have been reported. We now report an apparent suicide in which fluoxetine was the only causative agent. Because this drug is widely described as having a wide safety margin, it is important to note concentrations in blood associated with overdose fatalities. The findings by GC/NPD and GC/MS in blood were as follows: fluoxetine 6,000 ng and demethylated metabolite 5,000 ng/mL. Parent compound and metabolite were 13,000 ng/mL each in bile. Details of the analytical method and data from 2,100 National Medical Services cases are also presented.

Abstract: Fluoxetine appears to cause a low incidence of adverse cardiac effects. An uncommon but potentially hazardous effect of fluoxetine therapy, however, is bradycardia accompanied by faintness or syncope. The authors report two cases in which this adverse effect occurred. They hypothesize that the mechanism of bradycardia in these cases represents a direct central nervous system effect of increased serotonin on medullary cardiovascular regulation.

Abstract: The authors report two cases of ejaculatory dysfunction induced by fluoxetine. Cyproheptadine, an antihistaminic and antiserotonergic drug, restored sexual function in each case. Possible mechanisms of fluoxetine-induced anorgasmia are presented and treatment options are reviewed.
Date: 1990-09-01

Abstract: Six patients with chronic, refractory anorexia nervosa were treated with fluoxetine. Depressive symptoms diminished in all patients, and this was associated with weight gain. Subjects, despite frequent medical comorbidity, tolerated fluoxetine well, even in dosages greater than those used for depression.
Date: 1990-09-01

Abstract: A 39-year-old man suddenly became convinced that his wife had once been unfaithful to him, and soon thereafter he became depressed. Symptoms of depression responded to imipramine, but the jealousy did not. A trial of fluoxetine was attempted because of the obsessional nature of the jealousy. Fluoxetine 60 mg/day resulted in complete remission of the pathologic jealousy, consistent with the known efficacy of fluoxetine in obsessive compulsive disorder.

Abstract: Fluoxetine (Prozac) is a nontricyclic serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) reuptake inhibitor commonly prescribed for the treatment of depression. Fluoxetine also blocks 5-hydroxytryptamine reuptake in platelets and could potentially lead to clinically significant platelet dysfunction. We describe a patient who developed petechiae and prolongation of the bleeding time while receiving fluoxetine therapy.
Date: 1990-07-01

Abstract: The authors report adverse interactions encountered when using low dose (25-75 mg) trazodone to treat insomnia associated with fluoxetine. Sixteen patients had good hypnotic responses to trazodone, but five needed to stop the medication due to excessive sedation. Three cases are described.
Date: 1990-07-01

Abstract: Eight patients with depersonalization disorder or with depersonalization symptoms in association with obsessive-compulsive and panic disorders were treated with serotonin reuptake blockers. There was clinical overlap of depersonalization disorder with obsessive-compulsive disorder, and the co-occurrence of obsessive-compulsive and panic features with depersonalization in these patients was associated with a favorable treatment outcome. The chronicity of illness and lack of prior response to a variety of treatments in these patients highlights the positive outcome with this treatment. In addition, issues are raised regarding the current hierarchical exclusion of depersonalization disorder in the presence of obsessive-compulsive and panic disorders.
Date: 1990-06-01

Abstract: Twenty-five patients with a primary DSM-III-R diagnosis of panic disorder with or without agoraphobia were treated openly with the serotonin uptake inhibitor fluoxetine for up to 12 months. For most patients, treatment was initiated at 5 mg/day to minimize adverse effects previously reported with initiation at higher doses. Nineteen (76%) experienced moderate to marked improvement in panic attacks. Four (16%) were unable to tolerate fluoxetine due to adverse effects. Initiating treatment of panic disorder with low doses of fluoxetine may increase its acceptability and permit more patients to benefit from fluoxetine.

Abstract: Seven patients who met DSM-III-R criteria for obsessive compulsive disorder and had only a partial response to the serotonin reuptake blockers fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, or clomipramine or were unable to tolerate therapeutic doses of these agents due to side effects underwent open treatment with fenfluramine augmentation. Fenfluramine is a serotonin releaser and reuptake blocker which is marketed as an anorectic agent. In doses of 20 to 60 mg/day, fenfluramine augmentation was well tolerated and resulted in a further decrease in obsessions and compulsions in six of these patients. Larger controlled studies are needed to confirm this finding.
Date: 1990-03-01

Abstract: Six depressed patients free of recent serious suicidal ideation developed intense, violent suicidal preoccupation after 2-7 weeks of fluoxetine treatment. This state persisted for as little as 3 days to as long as 3 months after discontinuation of fluoxetine. None of these patients had ever experienced a similar state during treatment with any other psychotropic drug.

Abstract: Of the first 60 patients treated at our clinic with the antidepressant fluoxetine, 5 (8.3%) developed treatment-emergent sexual dysfunction (anorgasmia and/or delayed orgasm). Three of those 5 patients had a history of treatment-emergent sexual dysfunction while receiving other antidepressant agents. Clinicians should be aware of this side effect of fluoxetine.

Abstract: Clomipramine has been reported to be effective in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Children and adolescents, however, tolerate poorly the adverse effects of tricyclics. Fluoxetine and other serotonin re-uptake inhibitors also appear useful in OCD, and are safer than clomipramine. To maximize the therapeutic effects and minimize adverse effects, 6 adolescents with OCD were treated in single trials with a clomipramine-fluoxetine combination. Duration of combined drug therapy ranged from 4 weeks to more than 28 weeks. Patients were first treated with clomipramine alone; if improvement or adverse effects were unsatisfactory, they received the drug combination. Clinical global improvement with clomipramine alone was moderate in 3 patients and minimal in 3. With a combined clomipramine-fluoxetine therapy, improvements were marked in 5 patients, and moderate in 1. These improvements were obtained with relatively low daily doses: clomipramine at 25 to 50 mg, and fluoxetine at 20 to 40 mg. Adverse effects appeared greater and much less tolerable with clomipramine alone than with the clomipramine-fluoxetine combination. This drug combination was well tolerated. These preliminary data suggest that relatively low doses of a clomipramine-fluoxetine combination may potentiate therapeutic effects and minimize adverse effects in OCD patients. Larger controlled trials are suggested.

Abstract: Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a potentially devastating illness, both to the patient and family members. Its etiology is unclear, but some evidence points toward dysfunction in an orbitofrontal striatal-limbic neuronal loop. Although many agents have been used, clomipramine, a tricyclic antidepressant, appears to be the most promising therapy. Clomipramine was approved by the Food and Drug Administration and released for general use in early 1990 under the brand name Anafranil. Clomipramine's adverse effect profile is similar to that of currently marketed tricyclic antidepressants; however, it is associated with a higher frequency of seizures, estimated to be 0.7%. Although other serotonergic agents such as fluoxetine have shown promise in OCD, they have been studied only in a limited number of patients. Other agents, with the possible exception of monoamine oxidase inhibitors, either have resulted in inconsistent improvement or have been reported in an anecdotal fashion.

Abstract: Chronic laxative abuse was treated using an operant extinction paradigm in a 29-year-old woman with bulimia nervosa. Access to self-administration of laxative and placebo were alternated in an ABAB design. Outcome was measured by self-reported craving for laxatives and rates of drug self-administration. During baseline, the subject exhibited high rates of both craving and self-administration. During placebo phases, cravings and drug self-administration declined. Both measures increased when active drug was reinstated. The final return to placebo led to a decrease in craving and extinction of drug self-administration to zero doses per day. This paper introduces the concept of laxatives as reinforcers and provides a new approach to the treatment of laxative abuse in women with bulimia nervosa.

Abstract: Avoidant personality disorder is quite prevalent and can result in marked impairment in social and occupational functioning. Since it has been conceptualized as a disorder of personality, only limited studies of its potential sensitivity to pharmacological treatments have been reported, usually in relation to the treatment of social phobia. This report examines the relationship of avoidant personality disorder to social phobia and describes the successful pharmacotherapy of several patients whose targeted outcomes were their avoidant traits. Our experience with resolution of avoidant features with treatment with monoamine oxidase inhibitors or fluoxitene recommends a 2- to 3-month trial of these agents in patients with avoidant personality disorder whether or not there is comorbidity for another DSM-III-R axis I disorder.

Abstract: We describe three patients with concurrent DSM-III-R kleptomania and bulimia nervosa who all demonstrated a partial or complete response of both bulimic and kleptomanic symptoms to fluoxetine, trazodone, or tranylcypromine. These observations raise the possibility that pharmacological treatment may benefit kleptomania, and call for further study of the relationship between kleptomania, bulimia nervosa, and major depression.

Abstract: A fatality due to the ingestion of fluoxetine and ethanol is reported. Quantitation of the drug and its active normetabolite was accomplished by gas chromatography with a flame ionization detector. Identification of the compounds was performed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Tissue distribution of fluoxetine and norfluoxetine, as well as analytical details, is presented.

Abstract: Five patients receiving fluoxetine for the treatment of obsessive compulsive disorder or major depression developed akathisia. The typical fluoxetine-induced symptoms of restlessness, constant pacing, purposeless movements of the feet and legs, and marked anxiety were indistinguishable from those of neuroleptic-induced akathisia. Three patients who had experienced neuroleptic-induced akathisia in the past reported that the symptoms of fluoxetine-induced akathisia were identical, although somewhat milder. Akathisia appeared to be a common side effect of fluoxetine and generally responded well to treatment with the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol, dose reduction, or both. The authors suggest that fluoxetine-induced akathisia may be caused by serotonergically mediated inhibition of dopaminergic neurotransmission and that the pathophysiology of fluoxetine-induced akathisia and tricyclic antidepressant-induced "jitteriness" may be identical.

Abstract: The response to and management of an acute ingestion of a large quantity of fluoxetine hydrochloride in a 13-year-old boy with Tourette's syndrome and obsessive compulsive disorder is described. The patient's symptomatic course following the ingestion included a grand mal seizure, depressed ST segments on EKG, nausea, dizziness, and headache. In general, the fluoxetine was well tolerated: all of the symptoms and signs remitted spontaneously.

Abstract: A 31-year-old woman with advanced diabetes mellitus with secondary autonomic and peripheral neuropathy was admitted for treatment of major depression. Previous therapy with desipramine resulted in exacerbation of the patient's orthostatic hypotension. After admission to the psychiatric facility she was initially stabilized medically and treated with psychotherapy. Subsequent treatment with low-dose fluoxetine 5 mg resulted in a decrease of the patient's diabetic neuropathy pain. Further increases in the fluoxetine dosage resulted in improvement of her depression and increased pain relief. Therapy with fluoxetine did not result in exacerbation of the orthostatic hypotension. This preliminary case report indicates that fluoxetine may be an alternative to the tricyclic antidepressants and trazodone in the treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathy.

Abstract: Two patients taking stable doses of standard tricyclic antidepressants were additionally treated with fluoxetine as the first step in a transition to that drug. After fluoxetine was added, both patients' plasma tricyclic antidepressant levels increased substantially. Adverse side effects occurred in one patient. Fluoxetine may increase the plasma levels of standard tricyclic antidepressants and the likelihood of tricyclic antidepressant toxicity.

Abstract: The authors describe five patients with body-dysmorphic disorder who responded preferentially to serotonin reuptake blockers. They review the literature, describe how patients with excessive concern about body abnormalities lie along a spectrum of doubt and certainty, and discuss similarities and differences between this disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder.

Abstract: Patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder complain of anxiety-producing intrusive thoughts and/or perform repetitive, anxiety-reducing rituals. A combination of behavior therapy and drug therapy is generally beneficial in this relatively common disorder. Behavior therapy consists of exposing patients to anxiety-provoking situations and helping them avoid ritualistic responses. Drug therapy appears to work by blocking serotonin reuptake in the brain.

Abstract: 1. Twelve patients with borderline personality disorder and not suffering a major depression were treated with fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, in an open label trial. All of the patients improved, and 75% were rated as much or very much improved. 2. Treatment was generally very well tolerated, but careful dosage titration was important in some patients, especially to manage agitation. 3. Improvement has been maintained with continued treatment throughout the follow-up period which ranged up to six months. 4. Incidental findings suggest fluoxetine may also be of use in treating substance abuse, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, late luteal phase dysphoria disorder, dysthymic and cyclothymic disorders, and seasonal pattern depression. 5. These preliminary results support the hypothesis that borderline personality disorder may be related to a central serotonergic deficit.

Abstract: The serotonin reuptake inhibitor zimelidine may cause flu-like symptoms and Guillain-Barre syndrome. Guillain-Barre syndrome has not been reported with the use of the structurally related serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine. Flu-like symptoms are described in the manufacturer's literature on fluoxetine but are absent from published studies. We describe a patient who developed flu-like symptoms, urticaria and angioedema 2 days after fluoxetine overdose. There were no neurologic sequelae. This case confirms that fluoxetine may be associated with flu-like symptoms and suggests that, because these symptoms occurred after overdose, they may be dose related. The additional findings in this patient suggestive of allergy, an unusual feature of drug overdose, are discussed.

Abstract: The first of a series of 5HT reuptake inhibitors, zimelidine was withdrawn because of associated hypersensitivity reactions. There was concern that such reactions might be seen with other compounds of this class. Two depressed patients who had a sensitivity reaction to treatment with zimelidine were crossed over to treatment with fluoxetine and no abnormalities were observed. Both patients remained well during uneventful long term treatment with fluoxetine.

Abstract: Five depressed patients who had shown no improvement with trials of antidepressants from several chemical families, including fluoxetine, responded when lithium was given in conjunction with fluoxetine. Lithium augmentation of fluoxetine may represent a useful strategy in refractory depression.

Abstract: Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) can be considered a complex entity with possibly different subgroups responsive to specific treatment. This article presents two cases of OCD with self-mutilation, successfully treated with serotonergic antidepressants. The authors discuss a sub-group of OCD patients whose rituals present as self-destructive behavior and are responsive to pharmacotherapy.

Abstract: Fluoxetine (Lilly 110140) is a potent, specific serotonin (5-HT) uptake blocker which is being tested in man for antidepressant activity. One of 9 depressed patients receiving this drug developed a dystonic reaction, parkinsonian rigidity, and increased  serum prolactin levels, all signs of decreased dopaminergic activity. Homovanillic acid levels also decreased in the cerebrospinal fluid of this subject. We postulate that fluoxetine, via the increase in 5-HT activity resulting from 5-HT uptake blockade, inhibited both the nigro-striatal and tubero-infundibular dopaminergic neurons. These results provide additional evidence for a linkage between serotonergic and dopaminergic neurons in man.
