Abstract: Acute antiarrhythmics poisoning represents a challenge in the Emergency Department (ED). These patients often develop malignant arrhythmias in need of exceptional therapeutic measures in the ICU. We report a 47-year-old patient admitted to the ED 5 h after the ingestion of a large dose of amiodarone and flecainide in a suicide attempt. During their ED stay, the patient developed signs of cardiotoxicity evidenced by electrocardiogram and ventricular arrhythmias. The toxicological results showed a level of 4.8 mg/L amiodarone and 2.98 mg/L flecainide. He was successfully treated in the ED using a large dose of sodium bicarbonate and lipid emulsion therapy. After hospital admission, he remained stable, with no need for exceptional therapeutic measures such as mechanical circulatory support, cardiac pacing or ECMO. We emphasize the importance of an early start of pharmacological therapies in the ED, which might improve the outcome in antiarrhythmic acute poisoning.

Abstract: The study aims to describe the management of a case of life-threatening yew (Taxus baccata) intoxication.
The needles of the yew tree contain highly cardiotoxic taxines. Intoxication with taxines, typically as part of suicide attempts, may lead to potentially lethal arrhythmias which often require prolonged cardiopulmonary resuscitation and other supportive measures. No specific therapy has been described. In some cases, extracorporeal life support has been used.
After an attempted suicide with yew needles and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, a female adolescent was resuscitated for 6 hours according to Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support guidelines. Complex ventricular tachycardias were treated by repeated direct current shocks and broad complex bradycardia managed with transvenous cardiac pacing. Antiarrhythmic drugs (amiodarone, lidocaine), magnesium sulfate, and supportive measures (intravenous lipids, sodium bicarbonate) were provided. The arrhythmias finally resolved, and the patient did not show any significant neurological or cardiac short-term sequelae after 24 hours.
The authors describe the successful management of a case of severe taxine intoxication by prolonged conventional advanced cardiac life support lasting for more than 6 hours.
In life-threatening yew intoxication, prolonged cardiopulmonary resuscitation is absolutely essential owing to the long duration of the cardiotoxic action of taxines and can lead to an outcome without cardiac or neurological sequelae.

Abstract: Caffeine is arguably the most widely used stimulant drug in the world. Here we describe a suicide attempt involving caffeine overdose whereby the patient's severe intoxication was successfully treated with the prompt infusion of Intralipid. A 19-year-old man was found in an agitated state at home by the volunteer emergency team about 1 h after the intentional ingestion of 40 g of caffeine (tablets). His consciousness decreased rapidly, followed quickly by seizures, and electrocardiographic monitoring showed ventricular fibrillation. Advanced life support maneuvers were started immediately, with the patient defibrillated 10 times and administered 5 mg epinephrine in total and 300 + 150 mg of amiodarone (as well as lidocaine and magnesium sulfate). The cardiac rhythm eventually evolved to asystole, necessitating the intravenous injection of epinephrine to achieve the return of spontaneous circulation. However, critical hemodynamic instability persisted, with the patient's cardiac rhythm alternating between refractory irregular narrow complex tachycardia and wide complex tachycardia associated with hypotension. In an attempt to restore stability we administered three successive doses of Intralipid (120 + 250 + 100 mg), which successfully prevented a severe cardiovascular collapse due to a supra-lethal plasma caffeine level (>120 mg/L after lipid emulsion). The patient survived without any neurologic complications and was transferred to a psychiatric ward a few days later. The case emphasizes the efficacy of intravenous lipid emulsion in the resuscitation of patients from non-local anesthetic systemic toxicity. Intralipid appears to act initially as a vehicle that carries the stimulant drug away from heart and brain to less well-perfused organs (scavenging mechanism) and then, with a sufficient drop in the caffeine concentration, possibly as a tonic to the depressed heart.

Abstract: Nearly pure caffeine is sold as a "dietary supplement," with instructions to ingest 1/64th to 1/16th of one teaspoon (50-200 mg). We report a patient with refractory cardiac dysrhythmias treated with defibrillation, beta-adrenergic blockade, and hemodialysis to highlight concentrated caffeine's dangers.
A 20-year-old woman presented with severe agitation, tremor, and vomiting approximately 1-2 h after suicidal ingestion of concentrated caffeine (powder and tablets). Within minutes, ventricular fibrillation commenced. Defibrillation, intubation, and amiodarone administration achieved return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). Shortly thereafter, she developed pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VTach), with ROSC after defibrillation and lidocaine. She subsequently experienced 23 episodes of pulseless VTach, each responsive to defibrillation. Activated charcoal was administered via orogastric tube. An esmolol infusion was started. Hemodialysis was initiated once she was hemodynamically stable. She was extubated the following day, continued on oral metoprolol, and transferred to psychiatry on hospital day seven, achieving full neurological recovery. Serum caffeine concentrations performed approximately six and 18 h post-ingestion (pre/post-dialysis) were 240.8 mcg/mL and 150.7 mcg/mL.
Severe caffeine toxicity can produce difficult to treat, life-threatening dysrhythmias. Concentrated caffeine, marketed for dietary supplementation, presents a substantial public health risk that demands action to limit consumer availability.

Abstract: A 27-year-old woman with a history of depression and previous overdose presented within 60 min of ingestion of 50 g of caffeine powder. Initially alert but hypotensive and tachycardic, the patient developed a broad complex tachycardia followed by a seizure and multiple ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrests. Following multiple defibrillations for VF, eight cycles of cardiopulmonary resuscitation and treatment with amiodarone, lidocaine, magnesium and potassium supplementation, the patient went to the intensive care unit (ICU). While there, the patient had further VF and required haemofiltration for a profound metabolic acidaemia with cardiac rhythm instability. She developed a postcardiac arrest systemic inflammatory response syndrome with episodes of acute pulmonary oedema, profound vasoplegia, hypothermia and coagulopathy. After 5 days in the ICU, the patient was stable enough to be transferred to the ward, with a persistent sinus tachycardia, and was discharged 3 days later with cardiology and psychiatry follow-up.

Abstract: Inhalation or ingestion of aluminum phosphide (AP) generates phosphine gas on exposure to moisture, which, in turn, produces widespread organ toxicity primarily involving the lungs, heart, liver, and kidneys. Cardiac manifestations of AP poisoning include toxic myocarditis, refractory heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, and tachyarrhythmias including ventricular tachycardia (VT). A 19-year-old depressed male farm worker ingested ten 500-mg tablets of Celphos in a suicide attempt. Each Celphos tablet contains 56% AP. Over the course of 10 hours, the patient developed heart failure and respiratory failure associated with a rise in serum troponin level to 12.7 ng/mL. Serum electrolytes (including magnesium) and serum creatinine levels were normal throughout. His course was further complicated by acidemia and hypotension. These hemodynamic and metabolic abnormalities were initially corrected by assisted ventilation and continuous veno-venous hemofiltration. However, he developed hemodynamically stable sustained monomorphic VT, which proved unresponsive to treatment with intravenous magnesium sulfate and intravenous amiodarone therapy. After a decline in blood pressure, 6 attempts at electrocardioversion failed to restore sinus rhythm, and he died. Postmortem histologic examination of myocardium showed contraction band necrosis, early coagulation necrosis, edema, hemorrhage, and pyknosis of cardiac myocyte nuclei. Ventricular tachycardia associated with AP poisoning has been successfully treated with magnesium sulfate, amiodarone, and electrocardioversion. This case report documents failure of all 3 of these therapeutic modalities.

Abstract: High-dose insulin (HDI) and intravenous fat emulsion (IFE) are used in overdoses, although rarely combined. To our knowledge, IFE therapy has not been reported in overdoses of diltiazem, metoprolol and amiodarone. We report a severe overdose of these drugs treated with HDI and IFE in a patient with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). We also discuss the potential clinical implications of the inotropic effects of HDI in the setting of HCM and the use and efficacy of IFE in this overdose.

Abstract: We report the case of a 45-year-old woman who had ingested 2000 mg of flecainide with suicidal intent. She developed therapy-resistant ventricular fibrillation (VF) with cardiopulmonary arrest. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation and advanced life support were sustained for 64 min. Following intravenous amiodarone, the patient developed an effective spontaneous rhythm and resumed breathing. An amiodarone infusion was started and continued over a period of 72 h. She recovered completely after 5 days, leaving the hospital without neurological sequelae. Serum flecainide levels approximately 5 h post-ingestion were 850 mg/l. This case report confirms the value of amiodarone in drug-resistant VF, even when the cause may be another antiarrhythmic drug such as flecainide.

Abstract: Between January 1981 and April 1984, excessive serum concentrations of digoxin (5 ng/ml or higher) were recorded in 47 children, aged 2 days to 16 years. In 10 patients, the high concentrations were measured 9.25 to 48 hours after death and were significantly higher than antemortem levels in all cases (8.3 +/- 2.4 (+/- standard deviation) postmortem vs 3.3 +/- 1.5 antemortem, less than 0.0001). In 15 patients (40.5% of the living patients) serum concentrations of 5 ng/ml or higher reflected sampling errors; drug levels were monitored too closely to the administration of a dose. None of these children had toxic manifestations of digoxin. In 10 patients, the excessive concentrations were associated with renal failure and a prolonged elimination half-life (T1/2) of digoxin; in 3 of these patients, there were signs of digoxin toxicity. Six cases were caused by digoxin overdose (accidental ingestions, pharmacy error and a suicide attempt). In 6 additional cases, the existence of an endogenous digoxin-like substance (EDLS) was shown to contribute to the excessive levels of the drug. One case could be attributed to digoxin-amiodarone interaction. In 10 of 37 living patients, digoxin toxicity was diagnosed. After excluding the 15 sampling errors and 6 cases with EDLS, this represents 63% of the cases. There was a good correlation between digoxin elimination T1/2 and serum creatine concentrations (r = 0.71, p less than 0.01). The above observations suggest that excessive serum concentrations of digoxin may not necessarily reflect potentially toxic levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Abstract: A 61 year old man with mild aortic stenosis and chronic depression took 12.5 mg digoxin in a suicide attempt. Ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation were resistant to lignocaine and to phenytoin but responded to intravenous amiodarone, with restoration of pacing. Because of persistent hyperkalaemia he was also treated with Fab fragments of digoxin specific antibody, which bound most of the ingested digoxin. It is suggested that the treatment of choice in severe digoxin poisoning is amiodarone for ventricular arrhythmias followed by pacing if necessary and the use of Fab antibody fragments if hyperkalaemia persists.
