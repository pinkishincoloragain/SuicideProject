Abstract: BACKGROUND Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder that manifests in early childhood. Pharmacotherapy, including psychostimulants, is considered the cornerstone of ADHD management. Although stimulants have been associated with adverse effects, sedation following the administration of an amphetamine-based stimulant is an extremely rare adverse effect. CASE REPORT We report the case of a 6-year-old boy presenting with ADHD and a history of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). After discussing treatment options with his parents, he was started on a low dose of a methylphenidate medication. He was unable to tolerate the medication due to anorexia, insomnia, and irritability despite multiple adjustments in the dosages. A trial of immediate-release mixed amphetamine salts was initiated, starting from a low dose. The boy developed sedation and lethargy shortly after the administration of this medication. CONCLUSIONS Sedation is a rare adverse drug reaction to mixed amphetamine salts. Clinicians should proactively monitor for the possible adverse effects in patients with ASD and ADHD, including unexpected symptoms such as sedation. Reporting of adverse drug reactions should be encouraged to promote the post-marketing surveillance of medications.

Abstract: Stress-induced cardiomyopathy, also known by various names such as Tako-Tsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC), is a cardiomyopathy that presents different types of transient left ventricular dysfunction. We present two cases of reverse TTC occurring in two young men after amphetamine use and complicated by cardiogenic shock necessitating venoarterial extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO). Levosimendan was used in one case to prevent subsequent aggravation of left ventricular function provoked by the use of catecholamine in this context. In both cases, myocardial function recovered rapidly. Amphetamine use can lead to reverse TTC requiring transient mechanical assistance and inotropic support.

Abstract: N-Ethylhexedrone [2-(ethyloamino)-1-phenylhexan-1-one; α-ethylaminohexanophenone (NEH)] is one of the most recent synthetic cathinones that appeared on the illegal market in late 2015. The majority of information concerning the model of consumption of NEH and its impact on the body originates only from self-reports from gray literature websites and drug forums. There are only limited data associated with the concentrations of NEH in blood samples available in the literature. This article presents a case of fatal NEH intoxication and a method for the determination of this substance in whole blood. A 21-year-old man without any diagnosed diseases was admitted to the hospital due to disorientation, aggression and finally loss of consciousness. Hyperthermia (>41°C), tachycardia (>160 beats per minute), tachypnea (20 breaths per minute), blood pressure (110/60 mmHg) and acute kidney failure were diagnosed. After a few hours of hospitalization, the patient died. A plastic bag with a white powder was found in his underwear. Analysis of the powder by another laboratory revealed cocaine hydrochloride; however, no cocaine or its metabolites were found in the biological material upon testing in our laboratory. Therefore, re-analysis of the powder was performed, and NEH was identified. Liquid-liquid extraction followed by liquid chromatography-triple quadrupole-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis were used for the determination of NEH in blood. The validation parameters were as follows: calibration range 1-250 ng/mL, accuracy 106.5-109.9%, precision 3.5-6.3%, recovery 90.1-96.9%, limit of detection 0.07 ng/mL and limit of quantification 1 ng/mL. NEH was quantified in the blood at a concentration of 145 ng/mL. Additionally, amphetamine at low concentrations and 11-nor-9-karboksy-Δ9-tetrahydrokannabinol (THC-COOH) were detected. Our study provided information on the possible lethal concentration and toxidrome that clinicians can observe for NEH-intoxicated patients and can be helpful during the preparation of toxicology analysis reports for a court of law for proper data interpretation.

Abstract: Amphetamine and its derivatives' consumption is still an important public health issue, namely in terms of compounds variability and disposition to consumers. However, some of them, like 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), still live in the illicit market, with continuous success. Nevertheless, there is always new information and data on MDMA intoxication, both in vivo and in postmortem context. The authors report an intoxication case with MDMA, in an 18-year-old male, considered a potential organ donor after a cardiac arrest. Whole blood samples were collected in vivo, at the emergency room (ER), and postmortem, at the National Institute of Legal Medicine and Forensic Sciences. After a general screening procedure, samples were extracted by solid phase extraction (OASIS® MCX), followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. The whole blood postmortem sample was positive for lidocaine (<500 ng/mL), compatible with the ER intervention, and positive for MDMA (2278 ng/mL) and methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA) (49 ng/mL), while whole blood samples collected in vivo (during the maintenance of the individual under advanced life support), were positive for MDMA (504-1918 ng/mL) and MDA (20-89 ng/mL). Samples were negative for other substances, namely ethanol, other drugs of abuse and medicines. Results interpretation is pivotal to understand the behavior of the substance. Thus, in this case, MDMA postmortem behavior should be carefully evaluated, considering as possible influencers, in the specific context of the case, the time lapse between death verification, maintenance of the advanced life support and body manipulation for organ collection purposes. Also referred and discussed is the antemortem/postmortem ratio of MDMA obtained values, compared with literature references. There is no doubt that death was due to MDMA intoxication, but information from the analysis performed on the in vivo samples suggests that this type of sample should also be considered, in a complementary role, whenever possible.

Abstract: We describe the sudden death of a middle-aged man while having a sauna under the influence of α-pyrrolidinovalerophenone (α-PVP) (PM blood concentration: 0.8 mg/L), amphetamine (0.34 mg/L), and other drugs (buprenorphine, benzodiazepines), and engaging in solitary sexual activities. The drugs' effects on the cardio-circulatory system and on body thermoregulation combined with the high temperatures are likely to have been central mechanisms leading to death. The high levels of adrenaline triggered by sexual arousal and the respiratory depression caused by buprenorphine, in association with benzodiazepines, may have also contributed to his death. This previously unreported type of accidental autoerotic death illustrates the risk of using amphetamine-like sympathomimetic drugs (e.g. cathinone derivates) in hot environments such as a sauna, and during sexual activities therein.

Abstract: Exposure to synthetic drugs such as amphetamines may lead to significant consequences on the cardiovascular system. The prognosis of young adults with amphetamine-induced cardiomyopathy remains poor. We present 2 young patients (aged <40 years) who developed severe dilated cardiomyopathy after chronic amphetamine use. Thorough psychological evaluations demonstrated favorable features with patients being reliable and committed to their health problems. A left ventricular assist device (HeartMate II; Abbott, Chicago, IL) was implanted in the patients shortly after admission to optimize hemodynamic support and evaluate the potential for recovery. Within less than 1 year, significant improvement was achieved and successful explantation of left ventricular assist device was performed in both patients.

Abstract: Radiopaque densities can be observed on imaging after the ingestion of either foreign bodies or some medications. Our case report discusses an 11-year-old boy with autism spectrum disorder and attention deficient disorder who presented to the emergency department because of concerns for constipation and dehydration. Incidentally, an abdominal x-ray showed numerous radiopaque densities throughout his intestines in addition to his constipation. He was admitted, and his home regimen was reviewed to attempt to identify a potential source for these radiopaque densities. This case presented an interesting teaching opportunity in the identification of the radiopaque densities and review of pharmacokinetics.

Abstract: In this report, a pediatric case of bowel obstruction with sepsis complicated by methamphetamine toxicity is described. The decedent, an eleven-year-old female with a clinical history of pica, was found unresponsive in her home and pronounced dead following unsuccessful resuscitative efforts. Radiologic imaging showed multiple radio-opaque foreign objects in the stomach and bowel. Autopsy revealed a green leafy substance, coins and other metallic items, folded paper, and plastic in her stomach and bowels. Postmortem iliac blood and urine tested positive for amphetamine and methamphetamine. While the decedent's medical history and autopsy findings provided evidence consistent with bowel obstruction with sepsis due to the ingestion of foreign materials, the high methamphetamine concentration was suggestive of concurrent methamphetamine toxicity. Unique complications associated with this case include the phenomenon that methamphetamine toxicity and bowel obstruction can present similarly in children and the reported opinion that accidental drug ingestion is uncommon in children over the age of five. This case emphasizes that the age range for suspected accidental drug ingestion should be expanded for those with pica, as these patients, despite being older, may not be able to differentiate between what they should and should not ingest. Furthermore, when treating a pediatric patient with pica that appears to present with bowel obstruction, unintentional drug ingestion should also be considered, particularly if there is a suspicion that the child lives in a household where drugs are abused, given the prospect that drug toxicity can present similarly.

Abstract: Amphetamines, frequently used recreational drugs with high risk of toxicity, are commonly included in urine drug screens. This screening is based on enzyme immunoassay, which is a quick and easy-to-perform technique, but may lack specificity resulting from cross-reactivity with other compounds, causing false positive results. We present two cases of presumed false positive MULTIGENT® amphetamine/methamphetamine and MULTIGENT® ecstasy (Abbott®) immunoassays with the beta-blocker metoprolol. Both metoprolol-poisoned patients presented positive urine screening despite no history of drug abuse. No confirmation for amphetamine molecular structures was found with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The cross-reactivity was further investigated by doping urine samples with metoprolol and its two major phase-I metabolites. Metoprolol showed positive results for both amphetamine and MDMA tests at low concentrations (200 and 150 μg/mL, respectively). Metoprolol metabolites cross-reacted with the amphetamines immunoassay only, but at higher concentrations (i.e., 2000 μg/mL for α-hydroxymetoprolol and 750 μg/mL for O-demethylmetoprolol). In conclusion, false positive results in amphetamines and MDMA immunoassays are possible in the presence of metoprolol. Toxicologists should be aware of frequent analytical interferences with immunoassays and a detailed medication history should be taken into consideration for interpretation. In vitro investigation of suspected cross-reactivity should include not only the parent drug but also its related metabolites.

Abstract: Structural analogs of classic drugs, also called designer drugs, are a booming market due to the easy accessibility on the internet and their legal status. One of those 'legal highs' is an analog of phencyclidine, namely 3-methoxyphencyclidine (3-MeO-PCP). Very few fatalities have been reported where 3-MeO-PCP contributed to the death of an individual. We present the first fatal case in the Netherlands and one of the few worldwide. Postmortem biological samples and the presumed abused unknown substance, sold as ant poison, were obtained. 3-MeO-PCP was detected, and the resulting concentration was 152 μg/l in whole blood. The presumed taken unknown sample was identified as 3-MeO-PCP and thus linked to the victim. The cause of death was a combination of 3-MeO-PCP, amphetamine, and alcohol. Improved diagnostic skills are necessary to face these emerging novel psychoactive substances also in light of public health and social risks.

Abstract: Infective endocarditis is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, despite advances in diagnosis and treatment strategies. Injecting drug users are particularly at risk of endovascular infections, especially with multi-resistant and virulent microorganisms. Typically, patients with endocarditis present with constitutional symptoms, such as high fever and malaise combined with cardiorespiratory symptoms of valvular failure or emboli, such as septic pulmonary embolism.
A 33-year-old female with a history of peptic ulcer disease presented to the emergency department with 3 days of increasing unilateral calf pain and swelling. There was no history of trauma or immobilization, no fever or clinical signs of sepsis or cardiopulmonary symptoms. A history of recent i.v. amphetamine injection in the forearm was elicited and empiric treatment for endovascular infection was commenced. Workup revealed methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus mitral papillary endocarditis with gastrocnemius pyomyositis, multi-joint septic arthritis, and brain abscesses. After a 60-day inpatient stay, including intensive care admission for septic shock, the patient made a good recovery. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: The incidence of injecting drug use is increasing, and these patients are at risk of severe invasive infections with multi-resistant organisms. The emergency physician is most often responsible for the initial workup and treatment of patients with suspected infective endocarditis, with timely collection of blood cultures and appropriate antibiotics being essential interventions. This case highlights that even without fever, murmurs, or constitutional symptoms, severe multisystem infections from endocarditis can occur.

Abstract: Although there are reports of narcolepsy type 1 caused by lesions of the central nervous system, there are far fewer reports of narcolepsy type 2 (NT2) caused by discrete brain lesions. We report a case of a patient in whom NT2 was diagnosed after a viral illness, and inflammatory lesions in the right thalamus and amygdala were found. In addition, symptoms of autonomic impairment developed and postural tachycardia syndrome was subsequently diagnosed in this patient. To our knowledge this is the first reported case of NT2 resulting from central nervous system lesions in these discrete locations, as well as the first reported case of postural tachycardia syndrome associated with narcolepsy.

Abstract: Dercum disease is a rare disorder of painful subcutaneous adipose tissue masses typically presenting as a constellation of signs and symptoms affecting most organs, including slow lymphatic flow and fatty liver.
The University of Arizona Institutional Review Board considered this report exempt after patient consent. Multislice, multisequence magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen and pelvis was performed prior to and after d-amphetamine, with and without intravenous gadolinium.
Initial MRI demonstrated hepatic steatosis in Case 1; Case 2 had 2-subcentimeter lipid foci within the liver. Initiation of 10-20 mg d-amphetamine decreased liver lipid deposition from 16% to 4% in Case 1 and resolved fat deposits in Case 2 after ~1 year.
There is a dire need for novel treatment options for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease to prevent progression to cirrhosis. Reduction of liver fat by d-amphetamine suggests a potential therapeutic role in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.

Abstract: Dopamine transporter SPECT is an accurate adjunct to clinical evaluation for Parkinson disease when the diagnosis is difficult. Dopaminergic medications may significantly affect dopamine transporter availability and, thus, uptake of dopamine transporter tracers. A patient had a false-positive dopamine transporter SPECT result while she was taking dextroamphetamine and amphetamine for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. The SPECT findings normalized after amphetamine therapy was withheld. An accurate medication history combined with knowledge of drugs that interfere with dopamine transporter imaging is critical to ensure accuracy.

Abstract: Amphetamine induced ischaemic colitis is an exceedingly rare presentation of amphetamine toxicity. The cases reported in the literature have described mild or transient disease. We present a fatal case of ischaemic colitis induced by amphetamine use in a 44-year-old woman who presented in extremis after a cardiac arrest en route to the emergency department. A short history of headache, abdominal pain, vomiting and agitation preceded her admission. Imaging revealed changes consistent with ischaemic colitis. Emergency laparotomy revealed widespread colonic necrosis necessitating a subtotal colectomy. Despite aggressive resuscitation and inotropic support from arrival, the patient deteriorated intraoperatively and died in the immediate postoperative period. Histology showed arterial type ischaemia/reperfusion injury of the area supplied by the superior mesenteric artery. The patient's serum amphetamine level was 0.52mg/l (peak therapeutic levels <0.2mg/l). The postmortem examination concluded that amphetamines were the likely cause of the vasospasm, leading to profound colonic ischaemia.

Abstract: Tranylcypromine is an effective antidepressant from the class of monoamine oxidase inhibitors and is structurally related to amphetamine. However, reports differ regarding the potential metabolism of tranylcypromine to amphetamine and methamphetamine within the human body. We report a 25-year-old woman with severe depression who died due to a fatal tranylcypromine overdose in 2016. She had been prescribed tranylcypromine one day previously and had no history of previous suicide attempts or substance abuse. The body was transferred to a forensic medicine department in Tehran, Iran for the autopsy. A urine sample was positive for tranylcypromine, amphetamine and methamphetamine using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry after derivatisation with heptafluorobutyric acid. As amphetamines were present in the urine sample, it was assumed that the tranylcypromine had been converted to amphetamines metabolically. As such, it is possible that the legitimate use of certain prescription drugs may complicate the interpretation of test results for illegal drugs.

Abstract: A 5-month-old intact female domestic shorthaired cat had mydriasis, agitation, and increased locomotion after ingestion of lisdexamfetamine, 10.3 mg/kg body weight (BW). Despite treatment with IV fluids, IV acepromazine, oral cyproheptadine and intravenous lipid emulsion the patient's clinical signs worsened. Dexmedetomidine administered at 2 μg/kg BW and continued at 0.5 μg/kg BW per hour rapidly controlled the patient's signs. An episode of vomiting and hematuria developed. Follow-up 5 days after discharge revealed that the cat appeared normal.

Abstract: Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are medical drugs used to treat the chemoprophylaxis of malaria and a second-line anti-inflammatory drug.
We performed a study of cross-reactivity of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in the DRI Amphetamine Assay inspired by a case report of a self-ingestion of chloroquine after a family dispute, that involved the following: (1) an in vitro study with control samples of healthy subjects, (2) an in vivo study with samples of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, and (3) an evaluation of the cross-reactivity of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in 3 additional immunoassays.
In the case report, the Amphetamine DRI assay resulted positive both at 1000 ng/mL cutoff (1507 and 1137 ng/mL) and at 500 ng/mL cutoff (1178 and 642 ng/mL). Chloroquine urine levels were 103,900 and 100,900 ng/mL at 5 and 9 hours after ingestion. The results with control samples showed a positive cross-reactivity of chloroquine in the DRI Amphetamine Assay (approximately 0.74% and 0.89% at cutoff of 1000 and 500 ng/mL, respectively). Hydroxychloroquine did not cross-react with the DRI Amphetamine Assay up to 1,000,000 ng/mL. In patients treated with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine, DRI Amphetamine did not produce false-positive results. The comparative assay study showed a positive cross-reactivity of chloroquine in the Emit II Plus Amphetamines Assay with control samples.
Chloroquine can cause false-positive results in the DRI Amphetamine Assay when it is present at high concentrations. Hydroxychloroquine did not produce false-positive results neither in the DRI Amphetamine Assay nor in the others immunoassays evaluated.

Abstract: To determine if dextroamphetamine sulfate could improve symptoms of post-partum depression.
A woman with severe post-partum depression that was resistant to standard antidepressant therapy and psychotherapy was treated with dextroamphetamine sulfate extended release capsules 15 mg/day.
A quick and complete abrogation of the depression ensued along with improvement of migraine headaches, insomnia, and chronic fatigue.
Dextr6amphetamine sulfate should be considered as a treatment modality for post-partum depression.

Abstract: To describe another previous unreported manifestation of the sympathetic neural hyperalgesia edema syndrome - autoimmune hearing loss.
Dextroamphetamine sulfate 30 mg extended release capsules was given to a woman to try to help her conceive since, with her pelvic pain, chronic fatigue syndrome, and diarrhea, it was thought that an inflammatory condition related to permeation of unwanted chemicals into endometrial tissue related to the sympathetic neural hyperalgesia edema syndrome could be inhibiting her failure from conceiving despite three cycles of embryo transfer.
Not only did the symptoms mentioned above disappear, but she also noted marked improvement of hearing loss that had been present for several years. The improvement in hearing was documented by audiology tests and had not responded to many months of 15 mg/day prednisone.
Autoimmune hearing loss (diagnosis established by her ear nose and throat specialist) should be added to the long list of manifestation of the sympathetic neural hyperalgesia edema syndrome.

Abstract: Stimulant medications are used in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and serious cardiac complications can occur when these medications are abused.

Abstract: Recurrent aphthous stomatitis is a common disorder of the oral mucosa. The symptoms can range from a minor nuisance to severe forms that can be extremely debilitating. Two cases of chronic aphthous stomatitis are described. The patients sought help to ameliorate vasomotor symptoms. A diagnosis of sympathetic nervous system hypofunction was established. Treatment was aimed at restoring normal sympathetic function by the administration of dextroamphetamine sulfate. Since the patients have been on the amphetamine salts, neither their vasomotor symptoms nor their aphthous lesions have returned. Hypofunction of the sympathetic nervous system should be considered as a possible etiologic factor in patients with recurrent oral ulcers when not associated with known systemic diseases.

Abstract: Adolescents with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are increasingly attending college. This case report highlights the nature of the psychiatric difficulties these individuals may face and the potential role for college mental health practitioners.
A case of a female student with ASD presenting with significant inattentive symptoms.
The authors describe the unique features of this patient's clinical presentation, discuss relevant diagnostic considerations, and make recommendations about how to best approach treatment.
This student presented with symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), which were first relevant during her time at college, owing to increased demands on planning and other executive functions. She was eventually responsive to treatment with a stimulant, but had more side effects early on.
As individuals with ASD attend college, their mental health needs will require treatment. However, such treatment draws on a comparatively limited evidence base, and providers need to be aware of potential challenges that may arise.

Abstract: Stimulant medications are approved to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children over the age of 6 years. Fatal ingestion of stimulants by children has been reported, although most ingestions do not result in severe toxicity. Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate, a once daily long-acting stimulant, is a prodrug requiring conversion to its active form, dextroamphetamine, in the bloodstream. Based on its unique pharmacokinetics, peak levels of d-amphetamine are delayed. We describe a case of accidental ingestion of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate in an infant.
A previously healthy 10-month-old infant was admitted to the hospital with a 5-h history of tachycardia, hypertension, dyskinesia, and altered mental status of unknown etiology. Confirmatory urine testing, from a specimen collected approximately 16 h after the onset of symptoms, revealed an urine amphetamine concentration of 22,312 ng/mL (positive cutoff 200 ng/mL). The serum amphetamine concentration, from a specimen collected approximately 37 h after the onset of symptoms, was 68 ng/mL (positive cutoff 20 ng/mL). Urine and serum were both negative for methamphetamine, methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA), methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, Ecstasy), and methylenedioxyethamphetamine (MDEA). During the hospitalization, it was discovered that the infant had access to lisdexamfetamine dimesylate prior to the onset of symptoms.
Amphetamine ingestions in young children are uncommon but do occur. Clinicians should be aware of signs and symptoms of amphetamine toxicity and consider ingestion when a pediatric patient presents with symptoms of a sympathetic toxidrome even when ingestion is denied.

Abstract: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is an increasingly common diagnosis of childhood that manifests with symptoms that affect cognitive, academic, behavioral, emotional, and social functioning. There are a multitude of pharmaceutical therapies to choose from when managing this condition, and though many studies on the safety and efficacy of these medications have been published, adverse effects still occur.
This case discusses a previously healthy 8-year-old boy who had been prescribed 20-mg lisdexamfetamine dimesylate for ADHD however mistakenly took his brother's 36-mg methylphenidate extended-release tablets, resulting in hyperhidrosis, excessive thirst, polydipsia, and combative behavior that began within 3 hours of ingestion. He was evaluated at a community hospital emergency department and given lorazepam due to agitation and combativeness before discharge. However, he returned with hypothermia, hyponatremia, and status epilepticus resulting in intubation. Patient was transferred to our facility where a computer tomography of his head was negative and hyponatremia was corrected with 3% NaCl saline solution. A lumbar puncture was performed due to temperature instability before starting broad-spectrum antibiotics. Cerebrospinal fluid findings were normal, and he was extubated at 18 hours postingestion. Patient was discharged home after 3 days with no residual symptoms.
Though both lisdexamfetamine dimesylate and methylphenidate are widely used among pediatricians today for treatment of ADHD, reports of life-threatening water intoxication as a result of overdose is rare. Studies have reported that severe 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphtamine toxicity in adults is associated with syndrome of inappropriate diuretic hormone (SIADH) secretion, hyponatremia, and seizures, along with serotonin-induced transient elevation in antidiuretic hormone. Adult schizophrenics who receive psychostimulants have also been shown to develop polydipsia with hyponatremia. Although the use of psychostimulants in adult schizophrenic patients has been studied, literature on toxicity and effects in the pediatric psychiatric population is scarce. We would suggest that this patient's polydipsia and hyponatremia are most likely a result of his ingestion of a toxic dose of a long-acting agent known to cause secondary psychosis.

Abstract: To test sympathomimetic amine therapy on another type of chronic headache syndrome--headaches from temporal mandibular joint (TMJ) syndrome.
A woman with 20 years of severe daily pain from TMJ refractory to all therapies was treated with dextroamphetamine sulfate.
The woman showed immediate 100% relief from sympathomimetic amine treatment saving her from an expensive jaw breaking operation that was only given a slight chance of helping.
Unfortunately most treating physicians are unaware of this defect of sympathetic nervous system hypofunction leading to the absorption of toxins, which when it involves brain tissue, leads to severe headaches. Thus, the gynecologist who is aware of this syndrome because sympathetic nervous system hypofunction is the most common cause of pelvic pain, may need to intervene in women with chronic headaches, even TMJ.

Abstract: To describe a cause and treatment for chronic unremitting lower abdominal pain of long duration with unknown origin.
A 50-year-old woman with 30 years of unexplained right lower quadrant pain was treated with dextroamphetamine sulfate.
Dramatic complete abrogation of the pain occurred within two weeks. The complete relief persisted for two years while she remains on therapy.
Symphathetic neural hyperalgesia edema syndrome should be considered whenever there is refractory pelvic or abdominal pain.

Abstract: A 38-year-old woman, obese (219 kg), diabetic, hypertensive, chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 4, with low plasma albumin level (2.9 g dl(-1)) and marked proteinuria (22 g per day) was studied. Given the advanced-stage CKD with nephrotic proteinuria, we supplemented low-protein diet with high doses of a tailored essential amino acid mixture (AAs: 44 g per day) to improve weight reduction in the patient. After 20 months of conservative therapy, the patient lost 43 kg; despite two episodes of infection, albumin plasma levels increased up to 3.7 g per day. After a further 20 months of dialysis, the patient maintained a diet of 1800 kcal supplemented with 32 g of AAs and lost 47 kg, whereas both albumin (3.89±0.12 g dl(-1)) and C reactive protein returned to normal. During the follow-up period, anemia improved, erythropoietin was thus discontinued and insulin requirement decreased to 105 IU. This therapeutic option may be beneficial in advanced CKD patients with obesity and diabetes resulting from malnutrition.

Abstract: To evaluate the efficacy of dextroamphetamine sulfate for idiopathic frozen shoulder in a woman being treated for blad- der urgency and inability to lose weight despite dieting.
Dextroamphetamine sulfate was initiated at 15 mg extended release capsules increasing to 25 mg extended release capsules to a 47-year-old woman.
She lost 19 pounds in four months, her bladder urgency disappeared, and she had complete resolution of the idiopathic frozen shoulder problem.
Idiopathic frozen shoulder syndrome can be added to the long list of conditions that are related to hypofunction of the sympathetic nervous system and all respond to dextroamphetamine sulfate therapy. They gynecologist is more familial with this syndrome be- cause of it being the main cause of pelvic pain. Thus the gynecologist may become the physician who subsequently treats orthopedic or rheumatological problems or other health issues.

Abstract: To determine if treatment with dextroamphetamine sulfate can reduce pelvic pain that was attributed to adenomyosis.
Dextroamphetamine sulfate was given to a 32-year-old woman who suffered on a daily basis from severe chronic pelvic pain that was not relieved by laparoscopic removal of endometriosis by oral contraceptive and ibuprofen. The adenomyosis was diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging.
Within three months the pain was completely gone and has remained absent for six months.
Dextroamphetamine sulfate relieved pain from adenomyosis similar to its effect on endometriosis.

Abstract: To describe a distinctive pharmacological treatment for chronic pelvic pain and sciatica after spinal surgery with a laminectomy and spinal fusion failed to provide relief.
Dextroamphetamine suflate was prescribed to a woman with a history of chronic back pain which was attributed to a ruptured disc. The pain was still unbearable after surgery.
After adjusting dosage, within three months of the correct dose, 25 mg twice a day, relief was provided and has persisted for ten months.
Chronic pelvic pain and sciatica both may be symptoms of hypofunction of the sympathetic nervous system. In addition, with other pain symptoms, this can be effectively treated with sympathomimetic amines.

Abstract: To evaluate the effect of idiopathic orthostatic edema and the effect of thyrotoxicosis on weight fluctuation and fluid retention in the presence of surgically induced panhypopituitarism and diabetes insipidus controlled with hormone replacement.
Dextroamphetamine sulfate was used for weight gain when no other etiologic factor was found. Methimazole was used when weight loss occurred when serum T4 and free T4 indicated thyrotoxicosis.
Sympathomimetic amine therapy very effectively controlled the weight gain and methimazole controlled the weight loss.
Hypopituitarism and diabetes insipidus controlled with hormone replacement do not protect against fluid retention from idiopathic edema.

Abstract: The case described in this report is of a male infant who was found dead in a closet. His mother delivered the infant in the kitchen, left him wrapped in a towel, and called emergency medical services 4days after the delivery. At the autopsy, the growth suggests a full-term delivery, significant pathological findings were not observed, and the infant was estimated to be stillborn. After the autopsy, the police investigation discovered that the mother used a stimulant during the pregnancy and shortly before the rupture of the membrane. Toxicological analysis showed 1.60mg/L of methamphetamine in the blood, strongly suggesting that the fetal death was associated with this acute intoxication. Thus far, only a few cases of infant deaths have been reported in association with methamphetamine intoxication. The present case showed the highest blood concentration of methamphetamine compared to the past infant cases with this intoxication.

Abstract: This case report describes a woman with narcolepsy treated with racemic amphetamine (rac-amphetamine) during pregnancy and breastfeeding with follow-up on the infant's development up to 10 months of age. The pregnancy outcome and the pharmacokinetics of rac-amphetamine were studied during breastfeeding. The pregnancy and the delivery were uneventful. Concentrations of rac-amphetamine were determined in the plasma of the mother and infant, and in the breast milk with a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry method. Samples were obtained at 2, 5, and 9 weeks postpartum. The transfer of rac-amphetamine to the breast milk was extensive (mean milk/maternal plasma concentration ratio approximately 3). The breastfed infant had a low plasma concentration of rac-amphetamine (about 9% of the maternal plasma level) and the calculated relative infant dose was low (2%). No adverse effects were observed in the breastfed infant. The infant's somatic and psychomotor development up to 10 months of age was normal. Further studies of amphetamine prescribed for medical reasons during pregnancy and lactation are needed.

Abstract: The severity of cerebral hemodynamic disturbance caused by retrograde leptomeningeal venous drainage (RLVD) of a dural arteriovenous fistula (dAVF) is related to neurological morbidity and unfavorable outcome. However, the cerebral hemodynamics of this disorder have not been elucidated well. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between the cerebral venous congestive encephalopathy represented as a high-intensity area (HIA) on T2-weighted MR images and the cerebral hemodynamics examined by (123)I-iodoamphetamine (IMP) single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), as well as the predictive value of (123)I-IMP SPECT for the development and reversibility of venous congestion encephalopathy.
Based on the pre- and posttreatment T2 HIAs associated with venous congestion encephalopathy, patients were divided into 3 groups: a normal group, an edema group, and an infarction group. The regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) at the region with RLVD was analyzed by (123)I-IMP SPECT, and the results were compared among the groups.
There were 11, 6, and 3 patients in the normal, edema, and infarction groups, respectively. No patients in the normal group showed any symptoms related to venous congestion. In contrast, all patients in the edema and infarction groups developed neurological symptoms. The rCBF in the edema group was significantly lower than that in the normal group, and significantly higher than that in the infarction group. The cerebral vascular reactivity (CVR) of the infarction group was significantly lower than that of the normal and edema groups. After treatment, the neurological signs disappeared in the edema group, but only partial improvement was seen in the infarction group. The rCBF also significantly increased in the normal and edema groups, but not in the infarction group.
Quantitative rCBF measurement is useful for evaluating hemodynamic disturbance in dAVF with RLVD. The reduction of rCBF was strongly correlated with the severity of venous congestive encephalopathy, and loss of CVR is a reliable indicator of irreversible venous infarction caused by RLVD.

Abstract: To present a novel therapy for pediatric vulvovaginitis.
An eight-year-old girl with persistent severe vulvovaginitis of unknown origin also complained of unexplained weight gain and sudden academic difficulties. She was treated with dextroamphetamine sulfate.
She not only showed very quick and excellent relief from her vulvovaginitis but she also lost weight and improved her mentality.
Sympathomimetic amine therapy may benefit pediatric vulvovaginitis when an infectious cause cannot be ascertained.

Abstract: Myocardial infarction is an infrequent condition in young adults. In most cases, it occurs due to causes other than atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries, including blood hypercoagulability, congenital anomalies of the coronary arteries, their inflammation or spasm induced by amphetamine or cocaine use. Amphetamine and its derivatives, via increasing the levels of epinephrine, serotonin and dopamine in the central nervous system, exert their effect also on the cardiovascular system, causing coronary spasm, enhancing platelet aggregation and inducing tachyarrhythmias. The paper presents a case of a 42-year-old man admitted to the emergency department because of emaciation and dehydration. The man was conscious, without contact, with a significant elevation of body temperature and tachycardia. On the basis of examinations, a fresh infarction of the anterolateral wall of the heart was diagnosed and the patient was transferred to a cardiac intensive care unit. There, laboratory tests revealed significantly elevated markers of myocardial necrosis and the presence of amphetamine in blood and urine. In spite of the institution of treatment the patient developed cardiorespiratory arrest. Advanced resuscitation procedures were undertaken, however, they proved unsuccessful. The presence of an infarction focus was confirmed in autopsy. Toxicological analysis of the blood for the presence of alcohol-like substances detected amphetamine at a concentration of 269.5 ng/ml. After examining the complete body of evidence it was established that the patient had died of acute cardiorespiratory failure secondary to an extensive fresh myocardial infarction. As indicated by the accumulated data, the most probable cause of myocardial infarction was amphetamine poisoning.

Abstract: To determine if treatment with sympathomimetic amines could improve the pain from complex regional pain disorder (CRPD) which was keeping a woman from trying to conceive her second child.
Dextroamphetamine sulfate was prescribed.
Within a short length of time the woman's wrist pain considerably improved to the point that she is ready to try in vitro fertilization once again to have a second baby.
Though sympathomimetic amines are used by some reproductive endocrinologists for unexplained infertility and unexplained recurrent miscarriages, the most common use by the gynecologist is for pelvic pain. Despite the thought by some clinicians and researchers that the etiology for CRPD may be related to sympathetic nervous system hyperactivity (and thus sympathomimetic amines could theoretically exacerbate the symptoms), in fact, the treatment with dextroamphetamine sulfate may turn out to be a new and possibly the most effective, least risky, and least expensive treatment to date for CRPD.

Abstract: To describe a unique disorder where a transient 6th nerve palsy leading to diploplia following orgasm developed in a 28-year-old woman. This coincided with a weight gain of 100 pounds in a short time without a corresponding change in dietary habits.
She was treated with the sympathomimetic amine dextroamphetamine sulfate.
Indeed she immediately responded to treatment with dextroamphetamine sulfate sustained release capsules with complete resolution of the episodes of 6th nerve palsy following orgasm.
The main importance of this case is that it suggests that orgasm causes a transient generalized decrease in sympathetic nervous system activity and that the achievement of an orgasm may require an increase in the sympathetic nervous system activity.

Abstract: To evaluate the effect of sympathomimetic amine therapy for a life threatening autoimmune disorder.
Dextroamphetamine sulfate was used to treat edema, myalgia, and chronic fatigue associated with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH).
Sympathomimetic amine therapy completely abrogated the symptoms associated with AIH.
AIH should be added to the long list of chronic treatment-refractory conditions that respond quickly and effectively to treatment with sympathomimetic amines.

Abstract: Methoxetamine (MXE) is a psychoactive substance distributed mostly via the Internet and is not liable to legal regulation in Poland. MXE has a toxicity profile similar to that of ketamine but longer-lasting effects. The paper describes a case of acute poisoning that resulted from recreational use of MXE and amphetamine and ended in death. In mid-July 2012, a 31-year old man was admitted to the clinical toxicology unit in Gdańsk because of poisoning with an unknown psychoactive substance. The patient was transported to the emergency department (ED) at 5:15 a.m. in a very poor general condition, in a deep coma, with acute respiratory failure, hyperthermia (> 39°C) and generalized seizures. Laboratory tests showed marked leukocytosis, signs of massive rhabdomyolysis, hepatic failure and beginning of acute renal failure. Despite intensive therapy, the patient died 4 weeks after the poisoning in the course of multi-organ dysfunction syndrome. Chemical and toxicological studies of serum and urine samples collected on the poisoning day at 1:40 p.m. confirmed that amphetamine and MXE had been taken earlier that day. Concentration of amphetamine in the serum (0.06 μg/ml) was within the non-toxic range, while MXE (0.32 μg/ml) was within the toxic range of concentrations. Amphetamine was also detected in the patient's hair, which suggested a possibility of its use within the last dozen weeks or so. The serious clinical course of intoxication and co-existence of amphetamine and MXE in the patient's blood and urine suggest the possibility of adverse interactions between them.

Abstract: To evaluate the efficacy of sympathomimetic amine therapy on a mitochondrial abnormality known as the mitochondrial encephalopathy lactic acidosis and stroke-like symptoms syndrome (MELAS syndrome).
Dextroamphetamine sulfate 15 mg extended release capsule was prescribed to a woman with a 25 year history of MELAS syndrome refractory to most other therapies.
Within one month of therapy the woman noticed considerable improvement in her chronic fatigue, pain, and edema.
The MELAS syndrome is thus another condition to add to the list of various chronic refractory disorders that improve considerably after dextroamphetamine therapy. This is the first mitochondrial disorder shown to improve with sympathomimetic amines which could suggest that dextroamphetamine could prove useful in decreasing the risk of aneuploidy in women of advanced reproductive age.

Abstract: To determine if sympathomimetic amines may relieve migraine headache pain from pseudotumor cerebri (PTC) similar to its effect on helping other types of migraine headaches that were recalcitrant to other therapies.
A woman with severe migraine headaches which did not respond to treatment with acetazolamide was treated with dextroamphetamine sulfate sustained release capsules 25 mg daily.
The patient demonstrated marked improvement within a month. The marked decrease in headache pain has persisted over a year. Her papilledema also completely disappeared.
The sympathetic neural hyperalgesia edema syndrome can manifest as PTC. Besides headaches, other symptoms that the patient manifested were part of this syndrome including chronic fatigue, inability to lose weight despite dieting, and backache. All of these additional symptoms also improved with sympathomimetic amine therapy.

Abstract: To present two other dermatologic conditions related to a disorder of sympathetic nervous system hypofunction common in women that respond to treatment with dextroamphetamine sulfate--chronic eczema and keratosis pilaris.
Case 1 was a patient with chronic eczema of 30 years duration was started on treatment for other conditions related to the sympathetic neural hyperalgesia edema syndrome, i.e., migraine headaches and chronic fatigue syndrome. Case 2 who also had chronic eczema also had a skin condition frequently associated with eczema--keratosis pilaris and he was started on dextroamphetamine sulfate for chronic fatigue syndrome.
Not only did the headaches and chronic fatigue syndrome in both patients markedly improve following sympathomimetic amine therapy but so did the eczema and keratosis pilaris.
Eczema and keratosis pilaris are two more chronic dermatologic conditions besides chronic urticaria and prurigo nodularis that respond extremely well to treatment with dextroamphetamine sulfate. Case 2 shows this condition is not restricted to females.

Abstract: To determine if treatment with the sympathomimetic amine dextroamphetamine sulfate, which has been so effective in treating a variety of pain syndromes, including severe pelvic pain and interstitial cystitis in women with the sympathetic neural hyperalgesia edema syndrome would also mitigate pain from fibromyalgia which was resistant to multiple therapies.
Dextroamphetamine sulfate extended release capsules once daily was gradually increased to 25 mg per day in a woman with treatment resistant fibromyalgia of 20 years duration.
Within a short time, the woman experienced dramatic relief of pain. Furthermore, her edema improved resulting in a 27 pound weight loss and her chronic fatigue improved.
Fibromyalgia can be effectively treated with an innocuous dose of dextroamphetamine sulfate.

Abstract: To determine if dextroamphetamine sulfate therapy could relieve severe headaches related to keratoconus of the eyes.
Dextroamphetamine sulfate 20 mg daily was prescribed to a 45-year-old woman who complained of 20 plus years of severe stabbing retrorbital pain who was diagnosed with keratoconus but failed to gain relief from bilateral corneal implants.
Dextramphetamine sulfate quickly and very effectively relieved the pain which has remained completely abrogated for over five years. Proof that the improvement was not fortuitous was demonstrated by quick return of symptoms when the drug was temporarily stopped after 2.5 years of relief but quickly dissipated upon resumption of therapy.
Headaches are common in women. It is the gynecologist (who is more familiar with the condition of sympathetic neural hyperalgesia edema syndrome because it is the most common cause of pelvic pain) who may be the physician to introduce dextroamphetamine sulfate as a treatment since this condition is unknown by many specialists in other fields.

Abstract: To show that a common but not well-known disorder of the sympathetic nervous system can present with symptoms suggesting a pheochromocytoma.
The standard treatment of this disorder (which is characterized by an abnormal water load test), i.e., sympathomimetic amine therapy, was given to a woman with paroxysmal tachycardia and hypertension.
Over a period of six months, the treatment eradicated the paroxysmal symptoms to which all other therapies had failed.
This condition recently named as sympathetic neural hyperalgesia edema syndrome can present with symptoms of a pheochromocytoma and will respond to therapy with low dosages of dextroamphetamine sulfate.

Abstract: The usual age at onset of narcolepsy with cataplexy is in the second or third decade. In cases with late onset narcolepsy with cataplexy, symptoms are usually mild with relatively less severe daytime sleepiness and less frequent cataplexy. Here we present a case of narcolepsy with cataplexy with onset of symptoms around sixty years of age. This case is unique, with severe daytime sleepiness both by subjective report as well as on objective Multiple Sleep Latency Test and having multiple cataplexy episodes in a day.

Abstract: In this paper a drug fatality that involved an unintended drug delivery route is described. The decedent, a 23-year-old female in custody in a county jail on suspicion of a felony drug offense, was discovered in a holding cell unconscious and unresponsive. Following unsuccessful cardiopulmonary resuscitation attempts she was pronounced dead at the scene. At autopsy a wad of multiple small loosely wrapped plastic packages held together with another layer of clear plastic was found in the decedent's vagina. The smaller plastic packages contained an off-white pasty substance that was later identified as methamphetamine. Toxicological testing of specimens collected during autopsy revealed methamphetamine in the decedent's subclavian blood, vitreous fluid, and urine at extremely high concentrations (42.6, 20.1, and 771 mg/L, respectively). Amphetamine, the active metabolite of methamphetamine, was also present in the subclavian blood, vitreous fluid, and urine at significant concentrations (1.3, 0.5, and 20.4 mg/L, respectively). The cause of death was attributed to toxic effects of methamphetamine and the manner of death was ruled accidental. This report suggests that lethal concentrations of methamphetamine may be distributed to the systemic circulation via intravaginal absorption.

Abstract: An 85-year-old man developed l-dopa responsive parkinsonism indistinguishable from Parkinson's disease and subsequent dementia, followed by supranuclear ophthalmoplegia and neck dorsiflexion at the terminal stage. Midbrain tegmentum and medial temporal lobe were atrophic on magnetic resonance imaging, while decreased blood flow was predominant in frontotemporal lobes, detected by 3D-SSP of 123I- IMP SPECT. Alzheimer-type pathology without Lewy body pathology was confirmed at autopsy. Substantia nigra showed mild degeneration and several neurofibrillary tangles without Lewy body pathology or progressive supranuclear palsy cytopathology. L-dopa responsive parkinsonism could be an initial manifestation of Alzheimer's disease, which should be included in the differential diagnosis.

Abstract: Sympathetic nervous system hypofunction has been found to be associated with motility disorders of the bowel, including gastroparesis, pseudointestinal obstruction, and esophageal motility disorders. These disorders respond to sympathomimetic amine therapy. The purpose of this study was to see if this therapy could be effective in treating pathological constipation.
Dextroamphetamine sulfate 15 mg extended release capsules was prescribed to an 18-year-old young woman who had severe constipation with a bowel movement every two to three weeks and sometimes every five to six weeks who did not respond to standard therapy and where no definite etiology was determined.
Two hours after her first dosage of the sympathomimetic amine, she had a bowel movement and has had regular bowel movements ever since.
Sympathomimetic amine therapy seems to help severe constipation refractory to standard therapy.

Abstract: To evaluate the possibility that dihydrotestosterone (DHT) may play a role in the etiology of some people's migraine headaches.
Finasteride 5 mg daily was given to a young woman with chronic migraines.
The chronic migraine headaches almost completely disappeared shortly following therapy. However, symptoms returned shortly after stopping the finasteride due to dry eyes.
DHT may be an etiologic factor in causing migraines since finasteride suppresses DHT secretion. Alternatively, the benefit could be related to some other property of finasteride possibly by increasing testosterone which may compete with estrogen at the blood vessel level.

Abstract: We compare antemortem whole-blood to postmortem peripheral blood concentrations of methamphetamine and its metabolite amphetamine in three medical examiner cases. Antemortem specimens, initially screened positive for methamphetamine by ELISA, were subsequently confirmed, together with the postmortem specimens, by GC-MS analysis following solid-phase extraction. Methamphetamine peripheral blood to antemortem blood ratios averaged 1.51 (± 0.049; n = 3) and amphetamine peripheral blood to antemortem blood ratios averaged 1.50 (n = 2). These data show that postmortem redistribution occurs for both methamphetamine and amphetamine, revealing that postmortem blood concentrations are ∼1.5 times greater than antemortem concentrations. Furthermore, as both methamphetamine and amphetamine have previously been shown to have liver/peripheral blood (L/P) ratios of 5-8, it can be proposed that drugs displaying L/P ratios ranging from 5 to 10 may exhibit postmortem concentrations up to twice those concentrations circulating in blood before death.

Abstract: Fatigue is commonly reported in the primary care setting; however, its cause is often unclear. This article presents 3 cases involving patients with chronic fatigue syndrome who responded poorly to treatment. After clinical evaluation, all patients were found to meet criteria for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and underwent a standard regimen of a psychostimulant medication. After treatment with psychostimulants, the 3 patients reported improved symptoms of fatigue and pain, and cognitive and core ADHD symptoms. These cases suggest that ADHD and chronic fatigue syndrome (and possibly fibromyalgia) share a common underlying mechanism. This article presents a model suggesting that over time, ADHD (predominantly inattentive type) develops into a syndrome of chronic fatigue and pain. These cases indicate that fatigue may be an important presenting symptom of adult ADHD. These cases also suggest the need for additional research to determine the prevalence of ADHD in patients who present with fatigue, and, in those meeting criteria for ADHD, the responsiveness of fatigue to psychostimulant treatment.

Abstract: In this report, a unique and bizarre case of complicated suicide is presented. The decedent was found dead in the basin of a porta-potty, wearing women's pantyhose, jewelry, and makeup. The initial investigation was suspect for homicide. Although an autoerotic accidental death cannot be excluded, the patient's medical history and autopsy results provided evidence for suicide, including several substances positive in his serum. Tramadol was quantified to be 140 mg/L, approximately 470 times the therapeutic range. Moreover, formaldehyde was also present, presumably absorbed from the contents of the chemical toilet. An exhaustive search could not reveal similar circumstances of suicide in a porta-potty or with the levels of tramadol found in the decedent.

Abstract: A 44-year-old Caucasian woman presented to the emergency room with worsening low back pain and loss of cutaneous sensation over the paraspinal muscles from T10 to S1. The patient had ingested the attention-deficit disorder medication dextroamphetamine before engaging in intense physical exercise with subsequent consumption of 3 alcoholic beverages before developing symptoms. The patient's creatine kinase levels remained elevated for 8 days with constant severe pain under standard treatment for rhabdomyolysis. Despite stabilization of pain and laboratory values at discharge, the patient continues to experience low paraspinal back pain. In patients with risk factors for rhabdomyolysis, the use of dextroamphetamine should be monitored closely. Outside our findings, there is no literature linking dextroamphetamine with rhabdomyolysis at nontoxic concentrations or with use of the supplement caffeine containing weight loss supplement, Hydroxycut. The authors believe that further research into the potential role of dextroamphetamine use in the setting of other risk factors for rhabdomyolysis is warranted.

Abstract: To present a novel approach to prevent miscarriage by treatment with sympathomimetic amines.
Two women undergoing in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-ET) with a history of recurrent miscarriage even in IVF-ET cycles were treated with dextroamphetamine sulfate prior to their next IVF-ET cycles.
Both women successfully completed their first trimester. One woman delivered a live baby and one had neonatal death related to prematurity secondary to severe pre-eclampsia.
Sympathomimetic amines therapy may prove to be an effective therapy to prevent recurrent miscarriage especially in women who have failed despite progesterone therapy, and where no other etiologic factors have been determined.

Abstract: Pregnant women who misuse alcohol or substances often develop obstetric conditions that further complicate their pregnancy. This case study reflects on the maternity care provided for a woman who continued to use amphetamines during her pregnancy; and who was diagnosed with placenta praevia and subsequently suffered a placental abruption. Alcohol and substance misuse in pregnancy is currently escalating, increasing the risk in maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. Midwives must be confident in the advice and care they provide in order to reduce the risks caused by substance misuse, and be able to support this with evidence-based care.
The purpose of this case study is to discuss the obstetric condition involved with placenta praevia with the occurrence of a placental abruption in a woman who uses amphetamines during pregnancy; and the midwifery and obstetric care involved. INTEREST/RELEVANCE/CONGRUENCY: It will highlight the importance of evidence-based care in high risk obstetrics.
(1) Case summary; (2) discussion; (3) risk factors; screening, diagnosis and management; foetal and neonatal monitoring; postnatal management, and trauma informed care.
It was shown with planning, understanding, communication, and vigilance, the care of an amphetamine using pregnant woman with a diagnosis of placenta praevia and abruption can be successfully accomplished. The management of the woman discussed in this case study was within the recommendations currently available in the literature.

Abstract: A randomized placebo controlled trial with methylphenidate (MPH) was set up to identify the effects of MPH on cognition in healthy young adults (ea. without attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADHD). Subjects repeatedly performed tests of the immediate and delayed memory and vigilance tasks after administration of placebo or 20 mg MPH.
We report the case of an 18 year old man who participated in the study. He suffered from stuttering since childhood. During the study phase he reported a remarkable relief of the stuttering after the intake of 20 mg MPH.
For D-amphetamine the beneficial effect on stuttering has been demonstrated but it was never implemented in clinical practice because of important adverse events. MPH, an amphetamine analogue, doesn't present these side effects. For this reason, MPH seems to merit further investigation in a randomized-controlled trial as a possible agent in the treatment of stuttering.Methylphenidate, Stuttering.

Abstract: A 6-year-old girl displayed symptoms of serotonin syndrome after accidental ingestion of Vyvanse (lisdexamfetamine dimesylate). Dexmedetomidine was administered because of persistent neuromuscular hyperactivity and severe agitation despite initial therapy with benzodiazepines. Some children show a paradoxical reaction to benzodiazepines, and dexmedetomidine has a possible role in the treatment of serotonin syndrome.

Abstract: There are few reports from Japan on the analysis of fluids in survivors of body-packer syndrome. We analyzed the concentrations of stimulants in the serum, plasma and urine collected from three patients suspected of being body packers at immigration that were referred to hospitals between 2010 and 2011. The drugs were extracted with solid-phase columns and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). In all cases, wrapped, cylindrical packets of foreign bodies were detected in the intestinal tract on plain X-ray (X-P) and computed tomography (CT), and they were eventually removed surgically. In case 1, the patient presented with convulsions and tachycardia at admission to the hospital and one of the packets was found to have ruptured. In case 2, although the subject appeared to have an intestinal obstruction caused by the packets on the third day, he exhibited no symptoms on arrival and the packets did not appear to have ruptured. In case 3, the patient exhibited restlessness on the first day and one of the removed packets had ruptured. In all cases, methamphetamine (MA) and amphetamine (AP) were detected in serum, plasma and urine. In this study, we report the variation in MA and AP concentrations in survivors of body-packer syndrome. The serum and plasma concentrations of MA were high in subjects that exhibited symptoms of MA intoxication. MA and AP were also detected in the case in which the patient exhibited no symptoms of intoxication and the packets had not ruptured. These results suggest either that the stimulants may have seeped through the wrap of the packets, or that the subject had been abusing the drugs.

Abstract: To show that chronic fatigue syndrome can be mistakenly attributed to Lyme disease rather than considering sympathetic neural hyperalgesia edema syndrome. This common disorder of women, frequently, but not always causing pelvic pain, can present simply as chronic fatigue.
A water load test was performed in a woman reactive for B-Burgdorferi with chronic fatigue whose symptoms did not improve despite three months of treatment with doxycycline. A water load test was performed.
She failed the water load test by excreting only 50% ingested load standing for four hours. She showed marked improvement following treatment with dextroamphetamine sulfate.
This very treatable disorder of the sympathetic nervous system should be considered in women with an unknown cause of chronic fatigue or if the symptoms persist despite treatment of another potential cause.

Abstract: Although amphetamine drugs can damage dopaminergic axons, it is unknown whether chronic treatment with amphetamine increases the risk of developing Parkinson's disease (PD). Of 1,152 consecutive PD patients, 3 had a prior diagnosis of narcolepsy. This rate is five times higher than expected (p = 0.02). These patients had typical onset of narcolepsy and underwent treatment with amphetamine. Although preliminary, this observation raises the possibility that some factors intrinsic to narcolepsy or its treatment may be a risk factor for PD.

Abstract: A general practitioner decided that a first-time Scandinavian seafarer with hyperactivity disorder, reasonably well-regulated on dextroamphetamine, was fit for unrestricted work at sea. Carrying amphetamine across US borders is drug smuggling, and when the cruise ship could not supply his medication from local ports, his behaviour became so erratic that he had to be signed off. Doctors providing medical fitness certificates for work at sea must understand the special requirements of seafaring life, know details about medicine use restrictions aboard, and be familiar with international import bans and national prescription regulations for controlled substances.

Abstract: To describe a unique pharmacologic treatment for backache that seemed to be related to herniated discs.
Dextroamphetamine sulfate was prescribed to a woman who developed acute lower backache which was attributed to herniated lumbar discs.
Within hours the pain diminished and she was pain free within a week. The 100% relief has persisted for months.
Acute backache can be added to the long list of pain syndromes related to impairment of the sympathetic nervous system that is effectively treated with sympathomimetic amines.

Abstract: To determine if relief from various pain conditions with sympathomimetic amines may be a direct effect on pain fibers or related to improvement of edema.
A woman with severe migraine headaches resistant to standard therapy was treated with dextroamphetamine sulfate.
The headaches markedly improved shortly after treatment as did her vasomotor symptoms. However, in this case the inability to lose weight despite dieting related to edema did not improve.
The improvement of pain and vasomotor symptoms in this disorder of the sympathetic nervous system does not seem to necessarily be related to edema causing pain. Sympathomimetic amines may have a direct effect on sympathetic nervous system fibers. Thus, a more appropriate term for this condition instead of idiopathic orthostatic cyclic edema would be sympathetic hyperalgesia-edema syndrome.

Abstract: Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection is a true plague and a major health concern globally. It is one of the most significant pandemics in recorded history. Despite worldwide efforts to fight the pandemic, and now with the re-emergence of tuberculosis, those clinicians, personnel performing autopsies and medical caregivers are again at risk in the work place, especially in developing countries. We describe a case where a drug abuser, whose addiction was concealed by his parents, died in hospital. He was tested HIV-negative there. A medical tangle ensued and forensic autopsy was carried out. Autopsy confirmed he was an intravenous drug addict and had tuberculosis. Post-mortem blood was positive for HIV antibodies and he was diagnosed with AIDS. Due to social stigmas, lack of knowledge or inefficient medical laboratory procedures etc, such type of cases can become a hazard to those attending the sick and to autopsy pathologists alike. We provide the case description, autopsy findings and review of pertinent literature.

Abstract: Labetalol is commonly used for control of hypertension in pregnancy. A component of the workup for new-onset hypertension in pregnancy often includes a urine drug screen. A labetalol metabolite is structurally similar to amphetamine and methamphetamine, thus causing potential cross-reactivity in drug immunoassays.
We present one case of cocaine-induced hypertensive crisis superimposed on chronic hypertension and two cases of severe preeclampsia for which patients required escalating doses of labetalol for hypertension, with subsequent false-positive amphetamine urine drug screen results.
In pregnant women requiring labetalol for treatment of hypertensive disease, a urine drug screen may be falsely positive for amphetamines and methamphetamines. Providers should be cognizant of this possibility when interpreting the results of urine drug screens.

Abstract: Phentermine (PT) has been widely used as an anti-obesity drug. This drug has to be used with caution due to its close resemblance with amphetamines in its structure and toxicity profile. Recently, PT is in distribution by illegal modes and is found to be available through sources such as the internet, thus their misuse and/or abuse is threatening to be a serious social issue. In the present study, 32 cases of drug suspects were observed for PT abuse, detected using hair samples for drug analysis. PT and other amphetamines, such as methamphetamine (MA), amphetamine (AP), 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDMA) and 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA), were extracted using 1% HCl in methanol for 20 h at 38°C. The extracts were derivatized with trifluoroacetic anhydride (TFAA) and analyzed using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Among the 32 cases of PT abuse, MA and its main metabolite, AP were identified in seven cases and MDMA and its main metabolite, MDA were detected in two other cases.

Abstract: To determine if the treatment of cold induced urticaria refractory to conventional antihistamine-type therapy would respond to treatment with sympathomimetic amines.
Dextroamphetamine sulfate (15 mg) extended release capsules were prescribed to be taken daily in the morning.
The cold-induced urticaria completely disappeared and antihistamine therapy was discontinued.
Treatment of chronic refractory cold-induced urticaria effectively responds to treatment with sympathomimetic amines similar to other cases of chronic refractory urticaria that are not merely cold induced. Manifestation of idiopathic orthostatic edema, a condition predominantly of women, should always be considered in the differential diagnosis of baffling medical conditions.

Abstract: To describe a novel highly effective therapy for vasomotor symptoms associated with diminished oocyte reserve.
A 58-year-old estrogen deficient woman with severe vasomotor symptoms was treated with 20 mg per day of dextroamphetamine sulfate.
A marked immediate improvement was noted.
An acquired disorder of the sympathetic nervous system may be the etiologic factor for vasomotor symptoms in women with diminished egg reserve and treatment with sympathomimetic amines seems highly effective. This case will hopefully stimulate a larger series to determine its efficacy in a larger population.

Abstract: To determine if a defect in sympathomimetic amines, which is a common cause of various undiagnosed pain syndromes in women could be the cause of chronic pseudointestinal obstruction. Furthermore to determine if this life-threatening illness may similarly respond to sympathomimetic amines as in other pain syndromes, e.g., pelvic pain and interstitial cystitis.
A 23-year-old, five foot, female with chronic pseudointestinal obstruction, who lost 35 pounds down to 75 pounds, was treated with 15 mg dextroamphetamine sulfate and 50 microg of L-thyroxin (her TSH thyroid hormone level was markedly suppressed in the face of a slightly low free thyroxin level.
Her abdominal pain lessened then completely disappeared within a few weeks. Within one year she gained 25 pounds.
Chronic pseudointestinal obstruction is another way idiopathic orthostatic edema (a condition found predominantly in women) may manifest. Similar to other gastrointestinal pain syndromes and pain in other areas, e.g., pelvis, bladder, head and joints, treatment with sympathomimetic amines results in dramatic improvement.

Abstract: We describe here the case of an adolescent who developed eosinophilic hepatitis during treatment for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder with lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (Vyvanse [Shire US Inc, Wayne, PA]). A 14-year-old boy presented to his primary care provider with abdominal pain and worsening jaundice. A diagnosis of hepatitis was made with biochemical markers, but evaluation failed to provide an etiology. Worsening hepatitis prompted hospitalization and initiation of steroids for presumed autoimmune hepatitis. A subsequent liver biopsy showed evidence of eosinophilic hepatitis. Known causes of eosinophilic hepatitis were ruled out, and a presumptive diagnosis of reaction to lisdexamfetamine dimesylate was made. Discontinuation of the medication led to resolution of the hepatitis and normalization of the liver biopsy. To our knowledge, this is the first report of hepatic injury attributed to lisdexamfetamine dimesylate.

Abstract: Psychostimulants (methylphenidate and amphetamine salt) are the pharmacologic treatment of choice for children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. However, psychostimulants have been linked to a variety of vascular problems, including peripheral vasculopathy. This article describes four boys with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder who developed vasculopathy during treatment with psychostimulants.

Abstract: A prior report described the presentation of cocaine-induced trichotillomania, which resolved with the cessation of cocaine use. Here the authors describe the case of stimulant-induced trichotillomania that resolved with the discontinuation of stimulants and initiation of olanzapine. To the authors' knowledge this is the first reported adult case of stimulant-induced trichotillomania. The case is of a patient with a previous diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder whose symptoms of trichotillomania coincide with abuse of amphetamine and with the resolution of symptoms in the absence of amphetamine use. Given the increase in exposure of prescription amphetamines among adults, further study into the association between stimulants and adverse events such as trichotillomania is needed.

Abstract: The survival to discharge rate after unwitnessed, non-cardiac out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is dismal. We report the successful use of therapeutic hypothermia in a 26-year old woman with OHCA due to intentional poisoning with heroin, amphetamine and insulin.The cardiac arrest was not witnessed, no bystander CPR was initiated, the time interval from the call to ambulance arrival was 9 minutes and the initial cardiac rhythm was asystole. Eight minutes of advanced cardiac life support resulted in ROSC.Upon hospital admission, the patient's pupils were dilated. Her arterial lactate was 17 mmol/l, base excess -20, pH 6.9 and serum glucose 0.2 mmol/l. During the first 24 hours in the ICU, the patient developed maximally dilated pupils not reacting to light and became increasingly haemodynamically unstable, requiring both inotropic support and massive fluid resuscitation. After 1 week in the ICU, however, she made an uneventful recovery with a Cerebral Performance Category of 1 at hospital discharge and at a follow up examination at 6 months.
According to most prognostic factors, the patient had a statistical chance for survival of less than 1%, not taking into account her severe state of hypoglyaemia. We suggest that this case exemplifies the need for more studies on the use of TH in non-coronary causes of OHCA.

Abstract: Chloroform is still encountered occasionally in clinical and forensic toxicology, hence knowledge of the special problems presented in the detection and measurement of this compound in biological specimens may be required. The aim of this paper is to review the available documentation on this topic in the context of a chloroform-related death. Early one morning in February 1999 a 34-year-old female was found dead fully clothed on a path near to a neighbour's garden. Amfetamine intoxication combined with hypothermia was accepted as the cause of the death in the absence of any other identifiable cause. Further investigation 17 months later revealed a blood chloroform concentration of 31 mg/L and the cause of death was revised to chloroform poisoning. A murder trial ensued, the indictment specifying forced inhalation as the route of exposure. The liver chloroform concentration measured 38 months after collection was reported as 1064 mg/kg and opinions were offered at trial that the autopsy findings, which included a gastritis, but no evidence of injury to the inside of the mouth and oesophagus, excluded the possibility of ingestion of a toxic dose of chloroform. It was asserted that the explanation for the high liver concentration was that the liver had concentrated chloroform from blood after death against a concentration gradient. At appeal against conviction 7 years later the conviction was quashed. It was found that the liver concentration should have been reported at trial as 1 mg/kg. Moreover, chloroform found in the stomach contents (162 mg/kg) 86 months after collection was irrefutable evidence that some, if not all, of the chloroform had been ingested. Screening for volatile poisons should always be considered if a cause of death is not immediately obvious, especially in young people and in known substance abusers. If the presence of an unstable or volatile analyte is suspected then sample collection, transport, and storage must be performed with the analysis in mind. Quantitative analysis of all available specimens should proceed forthwith once the presence of an unstable analyte is established if the cause of death is in doubt or if prosecution may follow. In the case of chloroform especial precautions are needed: (i) headspace analysis should be performed at 35 degrees C to preclude the possibility of artefactual formation from trichloroacetic acid, (ii) precautions to prevent cross-contamination of biological samples in the laboratory must be taken, and (iii) interpretation of analytical results must take account of the widespread presence of chloroform in the environment on the one hand, and that the toxicity of chloroform varies greatly depending on the circumstances and intensity of exposure on the other.

Abstract: Autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are progressive neurodegenerative disorders which result in dysfunction of the neuronal systems of the spinal cord, brainstem, and cerebellum. The manifestations of daytime somnolence and abnormal sleep behavior have been described in SCA type 3 (SCA3) and SCA type 6 (SCA6), but as yet have not been described in SCA type 1 (SCA1). We report two cases of sleep disturbance, fatigue and excessive daytime somnolence in individuals with SCA1 and their progress through several therapies. These case studies are unique as they describe excessive daytime somnolence and sleep abnormalities in SCA1.

Abstract: The case presented is of a 49-year-old white male decedent who admitted to oral ingestion of methamphetamine. He believed he was being followed by the police while walking his daughter to school in the morning and swallowed the "8-ball of meth," which is known to be one-eighth of an ounce or the equivalent of about 3 g. The following autopsy specimens were analyzed for the presence of methamphetamine and amphetamine by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry: femoral blood, urine, bile, vitreous fluid, brain, liver, and gastric contents. Blood drawn at the hospital approximately 12 h after ingestion was also analyzed. The methamphetamine concentration in the hospital blood was 3.0 mg/L, and the concentration in the femoral blood from autopsy was 30 mg/L. Other drugs confirmed included tramadol, lorazepam, and 11-carboxy-Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol. The pathologist ruled the cause of death to be cardiac dysrhythmia due to excited delirium as a result of methamphetamine drug effects. Discussion of the timeline from ingestion to death and the clinical presentation of the decedent are included.

Abstract: To determine if sympathomimetic amine therapy, which has been effective in alleviating pain from various areas of the body in women previously refractory to conventional therapy, could help refractory migraine headaches.
Two cases with severe migraines resistant to conventional therapy were evaluated to see the response to dextroamphetamine sulfate.
Both women dramatically responded. Case 1 showed that the treatment benefit is long lasting and not merely transient as long as the woman remained on the sympathomimetic amine therapy. Case 2 showed that even premenstrual migraines can respond to this therapy.
It is not clear if therapy would only benefit women with an abnormal water load test or not. To determine if this therapy could be effective in refractory headache cases, even in women who pass the water load test, one would have to try the dextroamphetamine under similar circumstances and see the response. Similarly it is not known if it could help males with refractory headaches.

Abstract: The development and implementation of programs in the U.S. to minimize risks and assess unintended consequences of new medications has been increasingly required by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) since the mid 1990s. This paper provides four case histories of risk management and post-marketing surveillance programs utilized recently to address problems associated with possible abuse, dependence and diversion. The pharmaceutical sponsors of each of these drugs were invited to present their programs and followed a similar template for their summaries that are included in this article. The drugs and presenting companies were OxyContin, an analgesic marketed by Purdue Pharma L.P., Daytrana and Vyvanse, ADHD medications marketed by Shire Pharmaceuticals, Xyrem for narcolepsy marketed by Jazz Pharmaceuticals, and Subutex and Suboxone for opioid dependence marketed by Reckitt Benckiser Pharmaceuticals Inc. These case histories and subsequent discussions provide invaluable real-world examples and illustrate both the promise of risk management programs in providing a path to market and/or for keeping on the market drugs with serious potential risks. They also illustrate the limitations of such programs in actually controlling unintended consequences, as well as the challenge of finding the right balance of reducing risks without posing undue barriers to patient access. These experiences are highly relevant as the FDA increasingly requires pharmaceutical sponsors to develop and implement the more formalized and enforceable versions of the risk management term Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS).

Abstract: A 64-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital for recurrent stroke and cognitive impairment and was diagnosed with cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL). Iodine-123 iodoamphetamine single photon emission computed tomography showed hypoperfusion in the whole brain, but cerebral blood flow increased dramatically after the administration of acetazolamide in the cerebral cortex. Lomerizine, a diphenylmethylpiperazine Ca2+ channel blocker, can selectively increase cerebral blood flow. Cognitive decline and cerebral hypoperfusion improved during 2-year administration of lomerizine in this CADASIL patient, and thus, lomerizine is a potential candidate for treating cognitive impairment in CADASIL patients.

Abstract: A case of acute mathamphetamine (MA) poisoning death was occasionally found in autopsy by leaking into alimentary tract from package in drug traffic. A Korean man (39-year-old) was found dead in his apartment in Shenyang and 158 columned-shaped packages (390 g) of MA were found in his alimentary tract by autopsy, in which four packages were found in the esophagus, 118 in the stomach and 36 in the lower part of small intestine. The packages were wrapped with tinfoil and plastic film, from which one package in the stomach was empty and ruptured. Extreme pulmonary edema, congestion and hemorrhage as well as moderate edema, congestion and petechial hemorrhage in the other viscera were observed at autopsy and microscopically. Simultaneously AMP (amphatamine) in urine was tested positive by Trige DOA kit. Quantitative analysis was performed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Extremely high concentrations of MA were found in the cardiac blood (24.8 microg/mL), the urine (191 microg/mL), the liver (116 microg/mL) and the gastric contents (1045 microg/mL), and no alcohol and other conventional drugs or poisons were detected in the same samples. The poisoning dosage is 5 microg/mL in the plasma and lethal dosage is 10-40 microg/mL in the plasma according the report. This high concentrations of MA in blood indicated that the cause of death was result from acute MA poisoning due to MA leaking into stomach. Much attention must be paid in the body packer of drugs in illegal drug traffic.

Abstract: Amphetamine is one of the most common substances abused in pregnancy and one of the most potent sympathomimetic amines with respect to stimulatory effects on the central nervous system. I present a case of an amphetamine abusing parturient who developed postpartum convulsions and acute hemodynamic instability initially mistaken for eclampsia.

Abstract: A female in her late thirties, who was hospitalized for 13 days with rib fractures suffered in a traffic accident, was found in supine position on the patient's bed in a state of cardiopulmonary arrest. The resuscitation failed to recover consciousness and her death was confirmed 1.75 h later. The autopsy revealed neither severe injuries nor lesion as a cause of death. Histological examinations revealed contraction band necrosis (CBN) in the cardiac muscle of the left and right ventricles, as well as congestion and edema in both lungs. Toxicological screening of urine using Triage revealed the presence of methamphetamine (MA). By gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS), the concentrations of MA and its metabolite amphetamine (AP) in the heart blood were shown to be 0.178 and 0.051 microg/ml, respectively. From these findings, we conclude that the cause of her death was circulatory failure due to MA poisoning. Further, the stored scalp hair analysis demonstrated both MA and AP in 0-3 cm segments from the scalp. The results suggested that she was a MA abuser at least about 3 months before her death. In this case, preservation of hair samples collected during an autopsy was useful for providing evidence of MA abuse.

Abstract: In this study, we measured the urine concentrations of methamphetamine and amphetamine as metabolites of selegiline after ingestion of an overdose of selegiline. A patient who had developed Parkinson disease took selegiline in a suicide attempt. Analysis by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) with trifluoroacetic acid-derivatization revealed the presence of methamphetamine and amphetamine in the patient's urine at concentrations of 0.62 microg/ml and 0.25 microg/ml, respectively. To determine the stereospecificity of the methamphetamine and amphetamine, a urine sample was analyzed by GC-MS after derivatization with N-(trifluoroacetyl)-l-prolyl chloride. The methamphetamine and amphetamine were levorotatory in form. The ratio of the methamphetamine to amphetamine concentration in the urine was 2.5. This value is consistent with other case reports of ingestion of selegiline, which suggests that the methamphetamine to amphetamine concentration ratio in urine is useful information for indicating use of selegiline.

Abstract: A case study was conducted to investigate whether dexamphetamine enhances interference control in an adult with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Continuous electroencephalography was recorded both on and off dexamphetamine during performance on a Stroop task. An age-, gender- and IQ-matched control also completed the same task. Event related potentials for the control participant revealed a positive potential to incongruent stimuli between 270 and 440 ms, whereas for the participant with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder off medication, the reverse polarity was observed in a later time window. Following administration of dexamphetamine, however, the event-related potentials for the incongruent condition closely resembled those in the control, suggesting that dexamphetamine successfully normalises electroencephalographic activity.

Abstract: This case report describes an acute overdose in a female patient with the serotonin mixed agonist-antagonist m-chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP), a new synthetic drug that is also a metabolite of the antidepressant trazodone. Following ingestion of three multi-coloured tablets, she developed anxiety, agitation, drowsiness, flushing, visual disturbances and tachycardia. The mCPP concentration was 320 ng/mL in plasma and 2300 ng/mL in urine. Amphetamine (40 ng/mL), benzoylecgonine (47 ng/mL) and alcohol (0.7 g/L) were also detected in plasma. The concentration of mCPP in plasma was approximately six times higher than the usual concentration measured in patients under trazodone treatment (26-108 ng/mL, average 56 ng/mL). However, one should be careful to link the observed symptoms to the use of mCPP only as the other drugs that have also been taken or an interaction between the drugs could also have played a role.

Abstract: Methylphenidate and dextroamphetamine are central nervous system stimulants used in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorders in children. These medications have been associated with cerebral arteritis, renal necrotizing vasculitis, and systemic and pulmonary hypertension. We report 4 patients, 2 on methylphenidate and 2 on dextroamphetamine who presented with acral cyanosis, livedo reticularis, or Raynaud phenomenon. Two patients were found to have a positive ANA at low titers, 1 of whom had histopathologic evidence of stratum malgiphian necrosis with perivascular lymphocytic infiltration on skin biopsy. Two had positive antihistone antibodies. One patient improved after withdrawal of dextroamphetamine; others had worsening of their symptoms on higher doses of medications. These cases indicate the potential for development of acral cyanosis, livedo reticularis, or Raynaud symptoms with these medications and their potential contribution to a vasculopathy.

Abstract: To determine if sympathomimetic amine treatment could alleviate severe arthritic pain and fatigue associated with rheumatoid arthritis which was refractory to other medical therapy in a patient with a history of unexplained last trimester fetal demise and unexplained cessation of fetal movement and acidosis.
A 32-year-old female was treated with 10 mg of dextroamphetamine sulfate daily after failing to gain relief with standard therapy for rheumatoid arthritis.
After several weeks of therapy the patient noticed fewer flare ups of arthritic pain and a marked improvement in her fatigue. Six months on the sympathomimetic amines she noticed improvement in her ability to carry out everyday activities, less flare ups, and increased energy.
Sympathomimetic amines as demonstrated in this case report can effectively relieve joint pain when conventional therapies for rheumatoid arthritis fail, at least if the water load test is abnormal. Perhaps this therapy could prove beneficial in inhibiting chorionic villitis which can cause fetal death.

Abstract: Transient left ventricular apical ballooning syndrome was first described in Japan as "Takotsubo cardiomyopathy." This syndrome has been identified in many other countries. Many variations of this syndrome have been recently described in the literature. One of the rarest is the reverse type of this syndrome, with hyperdynamic apex and complete akinesia of the base (as opposed to the classic apical ballooning). In this article, we report an interesting case of a young woman who presented with this rare type of reverse apical ballooning syndrome occurring after amphetamine use. This report is followed by review of the literature.

Abstract: To determine if treatment with sympathomimetic amines can effectively treat gastroparesis that was refractory to other medical therapy.
After failing a water load test, a 29-year-old female was treated with 20 mg/day of dextroamphetamine sulfate.
After several weeks of therapy she noted that most of her symptoms of gastroparesis subsided and she has remained symptom free for eight months.
Similar to its beneficial effect on chronic pelvic pain of both bladder and non bladder origin, refractory weight gain, esophageal pain, chronic fatigue syndrome, headaches and vasomotor symptoms, sympathomimetic amine therapy can also effectively treat gastroparesis refractory to other medical therapies at least in some cases.

Abstract: Congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries CCTGA is a rare congenital disease first described by Von Rokitansky in 1875. Transposition of the great arteries comprises 2.6 - 7.8% of all cases of congenital heart disease, and if uncorrected, is commonly fatal in the first year of life. Patients with corrected transposition of the great arteries without associated defects may remain undiagnosed until adult life. Symptoms occur rarely before the fourth and fifth decades, when rhythm disturbance, left atrioventricular valve regurgitation, and moderately impaired systemic ventricular function cause congestive cardiac failure. We report here a case of drug overdose with ischemic symptoms, and CCTGA without associated anomalies in a 40-year-old male.

Abstract: Necrophagous insects may provide useful information about the time, place and cause of death. In addition, they can serve as reliable alternative specimens for toxicological analysis in cases where human tissue and fluids, normally taken during autopsies, are not available, due to decomposition of the corpse. This paper reports the results of drug analysis of the larvae of two fly families, Calliphoridae and Sarcophagidae, collected from the body of a middle-aged man who had committed suicide approximately three weeks before his corpse was found. Multiple samples of decomposed human tissue, of the blowfly, and of the larval flesh were analysed using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS), and amphetamine was detected in all samples. While the screening results were beyond doubt, the quantitative analysis was less clear, and further research is needed in this area.

Abstract: An 18-year-old man with attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) was prescribed varenicline for smoking cessation. He quit smoking after 1 week of therapy and remained smoke free for the next 17 days. During that time, he had also been taking amphetamine-dextroamphetamine (Adderall) on work days for his ADHD. Because his supply of amphetamine-dextroamphetamine was diminishing, he took only half (30 mg every morning) of his prescribed dosage from days 4-12 of varenicline therapy. He further reduced his dosage to 15 mg every morning on days 13 and 14 of varenicline therapy, and his supply of amphetamine-dextroamphetamine was depleted on day 15. On day 23 of varenicline therapy, he received and filled a new prescription for amphetamine-dextroamphetamine and resumed his prescribed dosage (30 mg twice/day). He began smoking again within 48 hours. Rechallenge with varenicline while the patient continued to receive amphetamine-dextroamphetamine yielded similar results. Data suggest that addition of amphetamine to varenicline may negate the partial agonism of varenicline, resulting in elimination of the smoking-cessation aid's benefits. Other potential mechanisms for the drug interaction may also exist. Thus, varenicline may not aid smoking cessation in patients undergoing treatment with amphetamine and amphetamine-like drugs.

Abstract: To describe a novel treatment of chronic pelvic pain.
Dextroamphetamine sulfate was prescribed to a woman with unexplained chronic pelvic pain. Pelvic ultrasound, colonoscopy, and lower gastrointestinal radiographic studies were negative. Laparoscopy was offered as the next diagnostic test but the woman requested an attempt at medical therapy first. Based on previous experience of dramatic relief of chronic pelvic pain of bladder origin with sympathomimetic amine therapy she was started on dextroamphetamine sulfate.
The relief of pain approximated 100% almost immediately and the pain relief has persisted for six months. Inadvertent failure to take the prescribed medication allowed the pain to return immediately only to disappear again once the medication was taken.
Disorders of the sympathomimetic nervous system may be a cause of chronic pelvic pain and are relieved by treatment with sympathomimetic amines.

Abstract: During a sport competition event in Taiwan, one urine specimen was found positive for both methamphetamine (2688 ng/mL) and amphetamine (462 ng/mL). The specimen donor claimed that she had taken Gewolen (a nonprescription drug manufactured in Taiwan) for treating abdominal pain and the medication was presented. Laboratory investigation confirmed that Gewolen contains famprofazone, which is known to metabolize to methamphetamine and amphetamine and is included in the prohibited list of the World Anti-Doping Agency. Study on the excretion profiles of three volunteers ingesting 50 mg famprofazone produced the following patterns similar to that observed in the case specimen: (a) the ratio of methamphetamine to amphetamine was approximately 6 to 1; (b) d- and l-enantiomers of both methamphetamine and amphetamine were present, while the amount of l-methamphetamine was 3-4-fold greater than its counterpart. The data suggested that famprofazone (as the ingredient of Gewolen) was likely the source of the prohibited drugs found in the case specimen.

Abstract: We describe a case of rhabdomyolysis involving the masseter muscle. It involved an episode of muscle lysis of the left upper and lower limb and the left masseter, after ingesting an unknown quantity of alcohol, amphetamines and ecstasy with prolonged immobility for an unknown period after collapse. Musculoskeletal sonography was used to diagnose rhabdomyolysis of the left masseter muscle.

Abstract: To corroborate or refute a previous case report from 20 years ago whether treatment with sympathomimetic amines is effective in controlling chronic urticaria.
All cases of chronic urticaria in our reproductive endocrinology and infertility practice were identified. All four had been treated with dextroamphetamine sulfate. Quickness and duration of response were then determined.
Four women were identified. All showed improvement within the first month. The marked improvement did not dissipate including two patients whose duration of improvement was 8.5 and 13 years, respectively.
Gynecologists should consider idiopathic edema as an etiology when facing chronic pelvic pain and urticaria. Since allergists and dermatologists do not seem to be aware of this treatment option, the initiation of therapy may need to come from the gynecologist.

Abstract: Priapism is a "persistent erection not accompanied by sexual desire or stimulation, usually lasting more than six hours and typically involving only the corpora cavernosa." Here we report on a gay male patient from our HIV/AIDS mental health clinic who developed serious priapism on quetiapine and recreational amphetamine. Gay men are at high risk for amphetamine use, and as such, this potential association between priapism, quetiapine, and amphetamine use should be considered in making prescription decisions with these patients.

Abstract: To describe a unique cause and therapy for vasomotor flushing.
Serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol, renal and liver function studies and urinalysis were performed as well as a water load test.
All laboratory tests were normal but the water load test showed inadequate four-hour urine excretion when she was erect but normal when supine. Complete relief from vasomotor symptoms occurred shortly after treatment with sympathomimetic amines.
Idiopathic orthostatic cyclic edema can cause vasomotor flushing even with normal estrogen and serum FSH, and treatment of the edema state with the drug of choice dextroamphetamine sulfate can effectively control these symptoms.

Abstract: Amphetamines are popular drugs of abuse, particularly among youngsters and at dance scenes. Cardiotoxicity (manifested as cardiomyopathy, acute myocardial infarction/necrosis, heart failure, or arrhythmia) after the recreational (mis)use of amphetamine and its synthetic derivatives has been documented but is rather rare. Amphetamine-related cardiac fatalities are even more rare. We present 6 cases of young persons who died unexpected after the chronic abuse of amphetamines. Death was not attributed to a lethal intoxication but to an acute myocardial necrosis, a right ventricle rupture, a cardiomyopathy, or an arrhythmia. Two of the deceased persons presented prior to their death to the emergency department, but their complaints were not considered (probably due to their young age) to be of cardiac origin. One case was a sport-related fatality where medical screening failed to identify the underlying cardiac pathology or the amphetamine abuse, and 1 case was a so-called idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy where substance abuse was not considered by the treating physician. We think that amphetamine-associated cardiotoxicity is a rare but probably genuine entity that should be considered both in forensic and clinical/emergency medicine because of its potential medicolegal implications.

Abstract: The anti-spasmodic drug mebeverine is used in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome. It has been found to be unstable and rapidly metabolized to initially form mebeverine-alcohol and veratric acid. Mebeverine-alcohol is a precursor for a number of amphetamine-like compounds. Consequently, these, in addition to mebeverine and mebeverine-alcohol, can produce false-positive amphetamine immunoassay results. Mebeverine is highly unstable in esterase-containing biological fluid (in particular blood and plasma), but it is largely stable in aqueous solutions and urine. Sodium fluoride did not appear to reduce mebeverine breakdown. Because of its unstable nature, mebeverine analysis should be performed as soon as possible after specimen receipt. Mebeverine, mebeverine-alcohol, and veratric acid concentrations should be measured in the blood/serum to assist interpretation; however, because of rapid metabolism/instability, mebeverine itself is rarely detected. In one fatal case of suspected mebeverine overdosage, mebeverine (1.2 mg/L), mebeverine-alcohol (74 mg/L), and veratric acid (127 mg/L) concentrations were measured in the postmortem blood; a high concentration of citalopram was also detected. In two fatalities involving possible therapeutic use, no mebeverine was detected, but mebeverine-alcohol (6.9 and 5.4 mg/L) and veratric acid (13.7 and 41.8 mg/L) were found by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and high-performance liquid chromatography-diode-array detection (HPLC-DAD) and measured by HPLC-DAD. Only one case involving mebeverine has previously been published; this paper provides additional data and suggestions of best practice for case investigation.

Abstract: We demonstrate how the application of physiological principles may help to identify unusual causes of a very low plasma potassium (K+) concentration (P(K)) and paralysis. In the two patients described, the short time course of the illness suggested that there was an acute shift of K+ into cells. The combination of a low rate of excretion of K+, the absence of a metabolic acid-base disorder, and the fact that the clinical findings occurred very soon after a large intake of carbohydrate supported this impression. Surprisingly, the P(K) remained low for many hours after these stimuli to shift K+ into cells had abated. The missing link in this story was eventually provided by the attending medical team with the help of their mentor, Professor McCance.

Abstract: To determine if a very effective therapy for idiopathic orthostatic cyclic edema--dextroamphetamine sulfate--would alleviate symptoms of chonic pelvic pain of bladder origin/interstitial cystitis.
Two women with interstitial cystitis that had been refractory to various therapies were treated with dextroamphetamine sulfate (20 mg/day) without any other treatment. The diagnosis of idiopathic edema was made by abnormal water load test and interstitial cystitis diagnosed by elevated scores on the pelvic pain and urgency and frequency symptom scale.
Both patients quickly improved their bladder symptoms and all pain and urgency was gone within a week. The interstitial cystitis remained in remission as long as the women stayed on their medication. One woman proved Koch's postulates by stopping the medication because of forgetting it and symptoms resumed quickly only to disappear again upon resuming therapy.
Dextroamphetamine sulfate can be a very effective therapy for recalcitrant cases of interstitial cystitis. Prospective placebo controlled studies are needed to determine what percentage of patients with this debilitating condition have concomitant idiopathic edema as determined by abnormal water load test and how well a larger series will respond to this novel therapy.

Abstract: Methamphetamine was detected in a 77-year-old male who had a history of congestive heart failure. Using a modification of a previously reported method, trifluoroacetyl-l-prolyl chloride was used to derivatize sympathomimetic amines to allow separation and identification of individual enantiomers. The l-enantiomer of methamphetamine and a trace amount of l-amphetamine were found in blood and urine specimens from this case. Further investigation revealed the decedent had bronchial asthma and regularly used a Vicks Inhaler, which contains l-methamphetamine as the active ingredient.

Abstract: Acute or chronic injury of the nervous system caused by xenobiotics can resemble primary disorders of the nervous system. In this study, four different cases that are characterized by unclear clinical presentation have been discussed; they required a detailed differential diagnostics using modern radiologic and electrophysiologic studies. Case 1. A young alcohol abuser was referred to the Acute Poisonings Unit at Wrocław with a presumptive diagnosis of methanol poisoning. Neither methanol nor ethylene glycol were detected in patient's serum and urine. During hospitalization in our ward he lost vision completely, and neurologic examination was consistent with a transverse spinal cord injury. Traumatic spinal cord injury coexisting with methanol poisoning, or even Devic's syndrome were considered in differential diagnosis. The MRI did not reveal a spinal cord injury, and the EMG showed severe demyelinating-axonal polyneuropathy. Finally the patient was diagnosed with methanol poisoning complicated by both loss of vision and severe alcoholic polyneuropathy. Case 2. A 27-year-old man was found unconscious in a street. A head CT revealed numerous small intracerebral hemorrhages, and patient's urine contained high concentration of amphetamine. A presumptive diagnosis of amphetamine poisoning complicated by intracranial hemorrhage was proposed. The repeat head CT revealed traumatic injury of the skull in a form of depression. Based on this result, the patient was diagnosed with a posttraumatic intracranial hemorrhage. Case 3. A young man with history of schizophrenia was transferred to our ward from a psychiatric hospital with a presumptive diagnosis of neuroleptic malignant syndrome complicated by rhabdomyolysis. Infection of the nervous system and focal lesions in the brain were ruled out with help of lumbar puncture and a brain MRI. After having obtained additional details of patient's history, it appeared that the patient had not been taking neuroleptics, and therefore it was assumed that patient's condition be connected with a catatonic type of schizophrenia exacerbation. Case 4. A 17-year-old woman, who returned from a disco club, presented with a bizarre behavior, she spoke incoherently, and she saw everything in bright and intense colors. Then she experienced a severe seizure attack with loss of consciousness and apnea. Toxicologic tests were negative. The patient was referred to neurology where she was finally diagnosed with epilepsy, and the attack was induced by strobe lights in a disco club.

Abstract: A case of a detained person who suffered from narcolepsy is presented. The management of the condition in general and with particular reference to the custodial setting is discussed. The management of obstructive sleep apnoea, the commonest sleep disorder, is contrasted. Forensic physicians are often confronted with rare or unusual medical problems in the custodial setting, often having to make immediate medical decisions without access to specialist medical advice. Twenty-four hour access to Internet medical resources in the custodial setting may be helpful.

Abstract: The authors present a case of the death of a young female drug addict due to intracerebral hemorrhage. Liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry was instrumental in the identification and quantitative determination of amphetamine within an intracerebral hematoma that had persisted for 13 days. In view of the fact that the deceased was young, did not suffer from any detectable diseases, and the narcotic substance was only detected within the hematomas, the case should be classified among rare complications of amphetamine abuse.

Abstract: Bulimia nervosa and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) share several key features, including impulsivity and low self-esteem. Stimulant medications have been highly effective in the treatment of ADHD. However, medication management of bulimia with antidepressants has demonstrated only partial resolution of bulimic symptoms. To date, there are no published reports of controlled trials evaluating the efficacy of stimulants for bulimia. The purpose of this paper is to report 6 patients with comorbid bulimia and ADHD who were treated with the stimulant medication, dextroamphetamine.
All 6 patients described reported complete abstinence from binge eating and purging after treatment with psychostimulants, and none of the patients discontinued taking the medication because of side effects. The side effect of decreased appetite proved beneficial in decreasing the desire to binge eat. However, all 6 patients remained within a healthy weight range.
Data from these case reports suggest a possible benefit of screening for ADHD as part of the overall evaluation of bulimia. In addition, these cases suggest the potential role of psychostimulants in the management of bulimia because of the high rate of abstinence from bulimic symptoms and the low rate of adverse side effects. Clinical trials are needed to fully evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of psychostimulants in the treatment of bulimia nervosa.

Abstract: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), commonly diagnosed in males, is often a "hidden disorder" in girls and women. This lack of recognition can be partially explained because the symptoms are less overt in females. In addition, coexisting disorders in females are often different from those seen in males who have ADHD. Higher rates of anxiety, mood, and substance disorders, as well as learning disabilities, often complicate the picture. Thus, clinicians are challenged with disentangling the symptoms of ADHD from symptoms of these coexisting conditions. In addition, fluctuating hormone levels may affect ADHD symptoms and treatment in females. Only with gender-sensitive diagnosis and treatment will the public health concern posed by the underdiagnosis of ADHD in females be addressed. This case report of a 23-year-old female illustrates the specific difficulties with the gender-sensitive aspects of the diagnosis and treatment of ADHD in females.

Abstract: The administration of psychostimulants to children with psychotic symptoms is controversial. This study reports the stimulant drug response of 5 children, aged 8-15 years, with childhood-onset schizophrenia (COS) and comorbid attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Four COS inpatients were given stimulants for comorbid ADHD after stabilization of psychosis on antipsychotic medication. A fifth COS inpatient received stimulants while still actively psychotic, despite concurrent neuroleptic treatment. Data from the 10-item Brief Conners Teachers Ratings Scale (BCTRS) were examined the week before, and the week after, stimulant addition. A paired t test, conducted using Conners Teachers data from these 4 subjects, indicated significant improvement in ADHD symptoms (p = 0.02). Data obtained from a retrospective chart review indicated no significant worsening of psychosis. The 2 subjects treated with mixed salts of dextroamphetamine sulfate and amphetamine sulfate remained on that medication at 6 months and at the 2-year follow-up. Our results suggest that ADHD comorbid with COS may be safely treated with a stimulant, once the psychosis is stabilized. A systematic investigation of this question may be warranted.

Abstract: A case report of a male presenting with a gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) induced coma at a gay-oriented dance event is reported. A friend accompanying the patient reported that when the patient started to become stuporous, he attempted to revive him with intranasally administered aliquots of crystal methamphetamine. Such treatment partially counters the hypotonia of GHB induced coma, resulting in "automatic" movements by the patient; however, it does not reverse the cognitive effects of the drug. The result increases the difficulty of medical management. The authors report the physical findings and implications for increased difficulty in managing such patients.

Abstract: A case is presented of a patient who described a koro-like syndrome related to amfetamine use; this consisted of a perception that his penis had reduced in size and was at risk of being sucked into his body. He described this as Whizz-Dick. This condition was also reported independently by amfetamine users attending a drug-addiction clinic. They described Whizz-Dick as a temporary penile shrinkage secondary to amfetamine use. Descriptions of penile shrinkage related to amfetamine in literature and from Internet sources are described. The relationship between Whizz-Dick and koro and its possible links with other psychosexual problems previously reported to be associated with amfetamine use are discussed.

Abstract: Enantiomers of amphetamine (AM), methamphetamine (MA), 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA), 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), and 3,4-methylenedioxyethylamphetamine (MDEA) exhibit different pharmacological properties. This may be important for the interpretation of analytical results. Plasma samples were analyzed using validated negative ion chemical ionization gas chromatography-mass spectrometry procedures. The results for clinical toxicology cases, divided into screening (SCR) and intoxication (ITX) cases, and those of driving under the influence of drugs (DUID) cases were compared. The concentrations of all enantiomers, except R-(-)-MDA and R-(-)- and S-(+)-MA, in the SCR samples were lower than in ITX and DUID samples. Differences between concentrations in ITX and DUID samples were only significant for both enantiomers of AM (DUID higher). These findings suggested impairment in drugged drivers. Different enantiomer ratios (R vs. S) were found for AM between DUID and SCR samples, for MDMA between ITX and SCR samples, and for MDA between DUID and ITX and DUID and SCR samples. Higher MDMA enantiomer ratios in SCR compared to ITX samples are in accordance with a previously described increase of those ratios over time, possibly allowing differentiation of recent from nonrecent ingestion. Pharmacokinetic analysis of a MDMA poisoning yielded elimination half-lives of 6.0 h for R-(-)-MDMA and 4.1 h for S-(+)-MDMA. The enantiomer ratios rose exponentially over time.

Abstract: Among young people in Norway the recreational use of amphetamine derivatives seems to be increasing. Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), known as ecstasy, is the dominant substance, having both stimulant and psychedelic properties. Depending on the illegal source of these so-called 'party drugs' the content and purity can vary. This case report describes the first lethal case of paramethoxyamphetamine (PMA) and paramethoxymethamphetamine (PMMA) intoxication reported in Norway. A 16-year-old male was admitted to a local hospital in a coma with seizures and hyperthermia after he had been found undressed and barefooted in a local forest (temperature 2 degrees C). He was intubated and given supportive care. Blood chemistry revealed hypoglycaemia, hypocalcaemia and hyperkalaemia. Shortly after transfer to the central hospital he developed bradycardia with continuous seizures and asystole. Adverse effects of MDMA are well described and include serotonergic and sympathomimetic symptoms with hyperthermia, coagulopathy, rhabdomyolysis and acute kidney and liver failure. Case reports of PMA deaths collectively suggest PMA to be more toxic than MDMA. A delayed effect after intake of PMA compared with MDMA can lead to increased intake. Hypoglycaemia and hyperkalaemia may be specific to PMA poisoning. Increased thermo genesis will result in a search for cooling, which explains the attempt to undress and a desire to submerge in water. In a cool climate this behaviour itself can be lethal. Measures to treat seizures, hypoglycaemia, electrolyte anomalies and hyperthermia are the therapeutic goals. No specific treatment is available.

Abstract: During the last years in Germany a marked increase in the use of amphetamines such as 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ecstasy) has been observed. The use of these recreational drugs is especially common among young people participating in rave parties. Occasionally ring-methoxylated phenethylamine derivatives like paramethoxymethamphetamine (PMMA) or paramethoxyamphetamine (PMA) are found in street drugs offered as ecstasy. These compounds exhibit a higher toxicity than the methylenedioxyamphetamine derivatives. We report on the death of a 22-year-old man after the ingestion of ecstasy pills containing PMMA and PMA. The PMMA concentration in femoral blood was 0.85 mg/l. Besides PMA (0.61 mg/l), amphetamine (0.21 mg/l), benzoylecgonine (<0.01 mg/l) and ethanol (0.46 per thousand ) were found in the blood. The case reflects the well-known fact that street drugs offered as ecstasy pills contain not necessarily MDMA but frequently differ in composition even if they have the same logo. Users of these pills therefore always take the risk of consuming pills with dangerous life-threatening ingredients. In many laboratories paramethoxyamphetamines are not detectable in routine analytical procedures. If the cause of an intoxication cannot be discovered by analytical routine methods, rarely occurring designer drugs such as PMA or PMMA should also be kept in mind.

Abstract: We present a fatal case involving the combined ingestion of amphetamine, 3,4-methylenedioxymethylamphetamine, 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine, and paramethoxyamphetamine. Various postmortem specimens (e.g., several blood samples, urine, and tissue samples) were analyzed to study the distribution of the compounds and their metabolites in the human body. Quantitation took place using liquid chromatography-sonic spray ionization-mass spectrometry after pretreatment with a liquid-liquid extraction. The medico-legal findings were compatible with a disseminated intravascular coagulation induced by hyperthermia caused by the simultaneous intake of the amphetamine analogues.

Abstract: Paramethoxyamphetamine (PMA) and paramethoxymetamphetamine (PMMA) are methoxylated phenylethylamine derivatives with effects similar to methylenedioxymetamphetamine (MDMA) and sold as such. However, PMA and PMMA are more potent than MDMA, but have a slower onset of action, which encourages users to take more. Three fatal cases involving PMA and PMMA in Denmark in year 2000 are investigated including history, pathological, and toxicological findings. The methods used for extraction, identification, and quantitation of PMA and PMMA are described. In two of the cases, lethal postmortem blood concentrations of PMA and PMMA were determined at 3.4 and 3.3 mg/kg (case 1) and 0.78 and 0.68 mg/kg (case 3), respectively. In addition, other drugs such as MDMA, tetrahydrocannabinol, cocaine, and alcohol were involved in these cases. In the third case, death occurred four days after the ingestion of tablets containing PMA and PMMA, and therefore only low postmortem concentrations of PMA and amphetamine were detected. However, in a serum sample taken at admission to the hospital, PMA and PMMA were found, but not quantitated. It is believed that the cause of death in case 2, multiple-organ failure, was caused by overdoses of PMA and PMMA.

Abstract: d-Amphetamine is a candidate agonist medication for the treatment of cocaine dependence, and evaluation of d-amphetamine effects on abuse-related effects of cocaine in preclinical assays is warranted.
This study was designed to assess the effects of chronic d-amphetamine treatment on cocaine- and food-maintained responding under a progressive-ratio schedule in rhesus monkeys. The effects of schedule manipulations on cocaine and food-maintained responding were also examined for comparison with d-amphetamine effects.
Key-press responding under a progressive-ratio schedule resulted in the delivery of cocaine (0.032 mg/kg per injection) or 1 g food pellets. The effect of manipulating cocaine dose (saline, 0.001-0.1 mg/kg per injection) or the number of food pellets delivered (0, 1 and 4 pellets) was determined. Subsequently, three schedule parameters were manipulated: (1) starting ratio value, (2) increments of the ratio progression, and (3) duration of post-reinforcer time-outs when the ratio value was constant. Finally, the effects of 10-day treatment with d-amphetamine (0.01-0.1 mg/kg per hour) were examined.
Break points increased as a function of cocaine dose or the number of food pellets, and similar break points were maintained by delivery of 0.032 mg/kg per injection cocaine and 1 food pellet. Manipulation of schedule parameters produced similar effects on responding maintained by cocaine (0.032 mg/kg per injection) or food (1 pellet). In contrast, d-amphetamine produced a dose-dependent decrease in cocaine-maintained responding and had less consistent effects on food-maintained responding.
These results are consistent with the hypothesis that chronic treatment with d-amphetamine decreases cocaine self-administration in rhesus monkeys, possibly by attenuating the reinforcing effects of cocaine.

Abstract: The GABA(A) receptor system provides the major inhibitory control in the CNS, with the alpha 1 beta 2 gamma 2 subunit combination being the most abundant and widely distributed form of the receptor. The alpha1 subunit knock-out (alpha1 KO) mice had a surprisingly mild overt phenotype, despite having lost approximately 60% of all GABA(A) receptors. The alpha1 KO mice had normal spontaneous locomotor activity, but were more sensitive to the sedating/ataxic effects of diazepam than wildtype (WT) mice. Pharmacological modulation of dopamine and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors also produced altered responses in alpha1 KO mice compared with WT mice. As expected, the NMDA receptor antagonist MK801, amphetamine and cocaine increased locomotor activity in WT mice. Although MK801 increased locomotor activity in alpha1 KO mice, amphetamine and cocaine induced stereotypy not hyperlocomotion. Binding studies showed no gross changes in the total number of D1, D2 or NMDA receptors. Furthermore, pre-pulse inhibition of acoustic startle and the effects of cocaine in conditioned place preference were similar in both alpha1 KO and WT mice, indicating selective rather that global changes in response to dopaminergic agents. These data demonstrate subtle changes in behaviours mediated by neurotransmitters other than GABA in alpha1 KO mice and suggest that compensation may have occurred beyond the GABAergic system.

Abstract: Patients with a severe mental illness such as schizophrenia have significant rates of concurrent amphetamine use. Such dual diagnosis patients have been shown to have poorer treatment outcomes. Often, they do not comply with treatment plans and have frequent episodes of hospitalization. There is growing evidence for the role of prescribed dexamphetamine in the treatment of amphetamine dependence. The prescription of dexamphetamine to patients with schizophrenia and amphetamine dependence has not been previously reported. Eight schizophrenic patients are described to whom dexamphetamine has been prescribed, with information being extracted retrospectively from case notes. In four out of eight cases, the prescription of dexamphetamine led to apparently good progress both in terms of substance misuse and psychiatric health. In two cases, progress was more equivocal, but appeared to produce some benefit. Two cases could be judged as treatment failures, but the condition and situation of the patients were not worse at the end of treatment than at the beginning. Compliance with neuroleptics increased in most cases. No patients exhibited exacerbation of psychosis as a result of treatment. The rate of outcome success is satisfactory when consideration is given to the difficult nature of this patient group, and their previous failure to respond to intensive treatment. It is argued that benefits may be gained from increased compliance with psychiatric treatment in patients prescribed amphetamine, and that this may outweigh possible risks. However, any conclusions are tentative in view of the nature of this study. A small open-label prospective study is recommended.

Abstract: We describe a case of massive hemorrhage in the cerebral ventricles, probably caused by methamphetamine abuse. A 44-year-old male was found dead in a prone position in a hotel room. Old and new injection marks were observed in his right cubital fossa. Petechiae were observed on the conjunctiva of his right eye, laryngeal mucosa, epicardium and under the capsule of the liver (to a slight or moderate degree). The brain, weighing 1.67 kg, was heavily edematous; the lateral and fourth ventricles were filled with hematomas. Subarachnoid, intracerebral hemorrhages were not observed. Cerebral vascular abnormalities were not evident. There were no remarkable changes in other organs, other than congestion. Gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric analysis of the urine disclosed the presence of methamphetamine and amphetamine. The concentration of methamphetamine within the femoral venous blood and intraventricular hematoma was 0.347 microg/ml and 0.189 microg/g, respectively. Amphetamine was not detected in either sample. Urine contained 3.15 microg/ml methamphetamine and 0.063 microg/ml amphetamine. These results indicate that intraventricular hemorrhage might have occurred shortly after intravenous self-administration of methamphetamine. Cerebral arterial spasm and hypertension resulting from the administration of methamphetamine might have resulted in intraventricular hemorrhage.

Abstract: This study was a case report of an amphetamine abuser who came to see doctor because of amphetamine withdrawal syndrome three days after stopping prolonged use of amphetamine. The patient was treated him with a slow-release bupropion at the dose of 150 mg per day. After taking bupropion, his withdrawal symptoms i.e. dysphoric mood, fatigue, somnolence, and psychomotor retardation gradually disappeared within two to three days. Moreover, his craving for amphetamines was absent. The authors discussed the possible application for the clinical use for amphetamine abusers or dependence.

Abstract: Two cases of toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) are presented. A 27-year-old woman presented with peripherally located targetoid plaques, papules, blisters and lip erosions which began 9 days after 'recreational' use of 'speed' (dexamphetamine and ephedrine) consistent with erythema multiforme major. Three days later she developed widespread lesions with large areas of blistering affecting 40% of body surface area. The diagnosis was revised to TEN. Intravenous cyclosporin led to rapid prevention of new blister formation. A 71-year-old woman, 3 months after commencing amiodarone, developed extensive erythema, blistering and erosions affecting 50% of body surface area, with a maculopapular rash affecting the limbs and extremities consistent with a diagnosis of TEN. She developed septicaemia following bilateral pneumonia with pleural effusions and died 7 days after admission.

Abstract: We report a child with retinal dystrophy and congenital (a)periodic alternating nystagmus (APAN) who responded immediately with improved visual function and electrooculographic parameters after taking the psychopharmacologic stimulant Dexedrine Spansule (Glaxo-Smith Kline, NC, USA) as part of treatment for his Attention Deficit Disorder.
Interventional case report.
General ophthalmic, ocular motor and sensorimotor examinations and ocular motility recordings were performed before and after administration of the drug Dexedrine Spansule.
The patient's binocular visual acuity improved only at 1.5 after medicine hours from 20/63 to 20/50, his exotropic deviation decreased from 25 to 10 prism diopters, his stereopsis increased from none to 800 sec/arc and ocular motility recordings showed increased foveation periods and more and lengthened APAN transition/null zones.
For unexplained reasons the stimulant Dexedrine "paradoxically" improved the nystagmus, binocular function and visual acuity in this patient with retinal dystrophy and congenital nystagmus. This observation may be the basis for investigation of a new pharmacological treatment approach to patients with congenital nystagmus or strabismus.

Abstract: The past several years have seen a marked increase in the recreational use of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) or "Ecstasy". MDMA use is especially common among young people participating in dance parties called "raves". Paramethoxyamphetamine (PMA) exhibits both structural and pharmacological similarity to MDMA. It may, however, be a more potent central stimulant, particularly in its effects on serotonergic transmission. Several fatalities from PMA have been reported in Australia, and here we report three recent fatalities that occurred in the midwestern United States in which each of the decedents believed that they were ingesting MDMA. Symptoms observed included agitation and bruxism, progressing to severe hyperthermia, convulsions, and hemorrhage. Blood was screened for drugs of abuse by enzyme immunoassay with the presence of amphetamines indicated in each case. Confirmation and quantitation for amphetamines was performed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The deceased, two males ages 19 and 24 and a female age 18, had postmortem blood PMA concentrations of 1.07, 0.60, and 1.90 mg/L, respectively. PMA is not a contaminant of MDMA, and no MDMA was found in any of these cases. The primary metabolite of PMA is produced by O-demethylation to 4-hydroxyamphetamine, a reaction catalyzed by cytochrome P450 2D6. This enzyme is noted to be genetically polymorphic. Those with the "slow metabolizer" phenotype may be likely to have higher peak blood concentrations of PMA. Whether any of the decedents described herein were of the slow metabolizer phenotype is not known. Several groups have advocated the onsite use of the Marquis Test for the purpose of pill screening in efforts to distinguish PMA from MDMA. A dark purple is consistent with MDMA, whereas PMA imparts no color change in this test. PMA is often in the form of a white pill with a Mitsubishi symbol on one side. This design has been identified in at least one of these fatalities.

Abstract: Cardiotoxicity manifesting as myocardial ischemia is not generally recognized as a side effect of amphetamine use or abuse. However, at least 9 cases have been reported since 1987. In this report a case of acute myocardial infarction due to oral amphetamine therapy is presented. The patient was treated with thrombolytic therapy but there were no signs of reperfusion. His coronary cine-angiograms were normal. The literature regarding amphetamine use or abuse is also reviewed, and the possible mechanisms of this pathology are analyzed.

Abstract: Children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are often treated with central nervous system stimulants, making the evaluation of medication effects an important topic for applied behavior analysts. Because assessment protocols emphasize informant reports and direct observations of child behavior, little is known about the extent to which children themselves can accurately report medication effects. Double-blind placebo-controlled procedures were used to examine whether 6 children with ADHD could recognize the effects of their medication. The children were given math worksheets to complete for 15 min during each of 14 sessions while on medication and placebo. Children completed a self-evaluation form at the end of each session, and ratings were compared to observed behavior and academic performance. Results indicated that 3 children were able to accurately report their medication status at levels greater than chance, whereas the accuracy of reports by all children was related to dosage level, differences in behavior, and the presence of adverse effects. The implications of these results for placebo-controlled research, self-monitoring of dosage levels, and accuracy training are discussed.

Abstract: Since 1990, there have been seven reported cases of sudden death in children treated with tricyclic antidepressants. This case study describes the sudden death of an additional child (8 years 9 months old, 29 kg in weight) treated with a tricyclic antidepressant, imipramine (100 mg orally, twice daily), and dextroamphetamine (10 mg orally every morning). Prior to death, there were signs of possible cardiovascular abnormalities after treatment was begun with imipramine. The report adds to the concern over the use of tricyclics in children.

Abstract: This paper aims to discuss the relationship between morbid jealousy, stalking behaviour, and psychodynamic issues. Comment will be made on the risk associated with diagnosis of adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and use of psychostimulants.
A man born in the former Yugoslavia charged with stalking was referred for assessment. He presented with a history of treatment for ADHD with dexamphetamine and delusions regarding his wife's fidelity.
The patient was treated with neuroleptics and counselling for himself and his family.
The patient was returned to the community. He separated from his wife but retains the abnormal belief.
The diagnosis of adult ADHD appears to be increasing in Western Australia. Treatment with stimulants is common. The misdiagnosis of ADHD and consequent misuse of stimulants, can lead to the development of morbid jealousy, stalking behaviour and arrest.

Abstract: To pilot single patient trials designed to improve decision making about stimulant use for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in general practice.
Patients previously stabilised on dexamphetamine were enrolled from a general practice. Each undertook a six week same patient randomised, double blind, placebo controlled crossover comparison of dexamphetamine with placebo for ADHD. Rating scales were completed weekly by self, parent and teacher.
Three of the four patients were clear responders to dexamphetamine (including a noncompleter, as his results still demonstrated a clear response). The results were clinically useful in each case. Management was confirmed for three patients and changed for one (who ceased dexamphetamine).
Prescribing stimulant medications only to children with diagnosed ADHD and who are found to respond, limits use of these worrisome drugs to those who will respond, and minimises their use in those who will not benefit.

Abstract: Amphetamines are powerful, sympathomimetic amines that, when used chronically, can profoundly effect a patient's cardiovascular stability during anesthesia and surgery. Amphetamines are the third most widely abused class of drugs in the United States. They also have legitimate medical use for attention deficit disorder with hyperactivity, exogenous obesity, and narcolepsy. We report a case of a patient with a 40-yr history of chronic amphetamine use having undergone two general anesthesias without complication.

Abstract: A 30-year-old male truck driver, known to be asthmatic, was found dead at the roadside lying near his car. A nebulizer bottle of Berotec (fenoterol hydrobromide) was found near his hand. The anatomic cause of death was suspected to be asthma. Toxicological screening of urine using Triage demonstrated the presence of methamphetamine. The blood concentration of methamphetamine was 0.4 microg/ml, and fenoterol was not detected. Hair analysis clearly indicated chronic methamphetamine abuse and medium dependency during the 2 months before death. We conclude that death might have been induced by the interaction of fenoterol and methamphetamine.

Abstract: A simple and sensitive method for the simultaneous analysis of fenfluramine, amphetamine and methamphetamine in whole blood was developed using a headspace-solid phase microextraction (SPME) and derivatization. A 0.5 g whole blood sample, 5 microl d(5)-methamphetamine (50 micrig/ml) as an internal standard, and 0.5 ml sodium hydroxide (1 M) were placed into a 12 ml vial, and sealed rapidly with a silicone septum and an aluminum cap. Immediately after the vial was heated to 70 degrees C in an aluminium block heater, the needle of the SPME device was inserted through the septum of the vial, and the extraction fiber was exposed in the headspace for 15 min. First, heptafluorobutyric anhydride was injected into the injection port of the GC-MS, and the compounds extracted by the fiber were then desorbed and derivatized simultaneously by exposing the fiber in the injection port. The calibration curves, using an internal standard method, demonstrated good linearity throughout the concentration range from 0.01 to 1.0 microg/g. The detection limits of this method were 5.0 ng/g for fenfluramine and methamphetamine, and 10 ng/g for amphetamine. No interferences were found, and the time for analysis was about 30 min for one sample. This method was applied to a suicide case in which the victim ingested fenfluramine. Fenfluramine was detected in the blood sample collected from the victim at the concentration of 7.7 microg/g.

Abstract: A case of massive intracerebral hemorrhage, a rare but often fatal complication of amphetamine abuse, is described along with the review of the literature. There has been resurgence in the abuse of amphetamine. Amphetamine or other illicit drug abuse should be considered in young patients with cerebrovascular events.

Abstract: In this study, findings related to an aircraft accident are reported. Biological specimens collected at autopsy from the pilot of the fatal accident and two types of tablets found at the accident scene were submitted for toxicological evaluation. It was determined that the pilot was dead at the crash site and the cause of death was multiple traumatic injuries. The tablets were identified as selegiline and levodopa, commonly prescribed for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. Selegiline, a stereospecific compound, is biotransformed into (-)-N-desmethylselegiline, (-)-methamphetamine, and (-)-amphetamine. The latter two levorotatory metabolites cannot be easily distinguished by routine analysis from their dextrorotatory isomers, which are controlled substances. It was, therefore, prudent to differentiate these isomers to determine if they resulted from the ingestion of a controlled substance, (+)-methamphetamine. Initial immunoassay drug screenings revealed the presence of amphetamine class drugs (867 ng/mL) in urine, amphetamine/methamphetamine (261 ng/mL) in urine, and methamphetamine (46 ng/mL) in blood. The gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) results revealed the presence of methamphetamine in the concentrations of 76 ng/mL of blood and 685 ng/mL of urine. The concentration of amphetamine was 52 ng/mL in blood and 320 ng/mL in urine. To determine the stereospecificity of these amines, the isolated amines from the biosamples were derivatized by a stereospecific agent, (S)-(-)-N-(trifluoroacetyl)-prolyl chloride, and characterized by a GC/MS method to be levorotatory. The 2.14 ratio of (-)-methamphetamine to (-)-amphetamine concentrations in the urine was consistent with a selegiline study in the recent literature. The stereospecific analysis, in conjunction with the history of the pilot being on Parkinson's medications, suggests that the source of these amines was selegiline. This conclusion substantiates the importance of the identification of enantiomers in evaluating and interpreting related analytical results for accident investigations.

Abstract: After a traffic accident a 32-year-old man was suspected of having previously taken an illegal drug. An immunochemical screening procedure revealed positive results for amphetamines in both urine and blood samples. The preliminary test was confirmed by GC/MS and both amphetamine and methamphetamine were found in both body fluids. However, the man denied any use of drugs but claimed to have taken four tablets of Gewodin. One of the ingredients, famprofazone, undergoes metabolic conversion to amphetamine and methamphetamine. Using GC/ MS the ingestion of famprofazone was verified by identification of the unchanged parent compound in the urine sample.

Abstract: Multiple visceral aneurysms are uncommon and usually result from connective tissue diseases, systemic arteritis, or mycotic lesions. An association between multiple visceral aneurysms and excessive oral amphetamine use has not been reported.
The clinical features of 2 patients at the University of Michigan Medical Center for treatment of multiple visceral aneurysms and amphetamine use were reviewed.
The patients had histories of excessive oral amphetamine use that ranged from 50 mg daily for 22 years to 200 mg daily for 2 years. No evidence was seen of systemic arteritis, connective tissue disorder, or an infectious process that may have caused the aneurysms. The arteriograms documented multiple splanchnic and renal artery aneurysms that involved both the large and the small arteries. The aneurysms of 1 patient were managed conservatively, and the patient has not had any clinical sequelae of the aneurysms during 14 years of follow-up. The second patient had hematobilia from a ruptured hepatic artery aneurysm that was treated with transcatheter embolic occlusion of the bleeding vessel. The patient had no recurrent gastrointestinal problems and continued to use amphetamines until his death from a cerebrovascular accident 6 years later.
A possible association between excessive oral amphetamine use and multiple visceral aneurysms is reported for 2 patients in whom other risk factors were absent. The potential for chronic oral amphetamine use to cause multiple visceral aneurysms is an ill-defined but not unexpected complication of this substance that is known to contribute to arterial hypertension and to produce a form of necrotizing arteritis.

Abstract: A 5-year-old boy presented with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), oppositional defiant disorder and separation anxiety disorder. The clinical assessment revealed longstanding parent-child relationship problems, ongoing family stress, and a chronic level of low grade depression in the mother. The treatment approach consisted of drug treatment of the child and long-term psychotherapy of the mother. At termination symptoms associated with ADHD were markedly reduced and parent-child relationship problems were no longer evident. It is argued that in a subgroup of children family stress and attachment difficulties may be involved in the development of ADHD. These difficulties should be considered separately in the treatment of children with ADHD, especially if still present after the symptomatic treatment. The treatment outcome raises the question whether or not certain symptoms attributed to ADHD may be reversible, and the long-term adverse outcome of the condition preventable.

Abstract: To describe the use of an N-of-1 randomised clinical trial (N-of-1 RCT) in general practice as illustrated by the case of a 16 year old boy with a learning and attention problem whose parents were convinced that amphetamines were necessary.
The N-of-1 RCT with a double blind technique was used in which a single patient served as his own control in testing whether amphetamine had any advantage over placebo.
No difference was noted in the boy's teachers' behavioural assessment scores nor in his own self reported ability to concentrate when taking either amphetamine or placebo.
This study showed that this patient obtained no objective improvement from amphetamine and the result was well accepted by his parents. N-of-1 RCTs are a relatively easy technique for tackling any area of therapeutic doubt. They can help the thoughtful GP to feel 'more like a scientist and less like a quack'.

Abstract: The authors attempted to treat Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) suboptimally responsive to one of the newer (second-generation) antidepressants by augmentation with a psychostimulant medication.
Seven cases of MDD showing a partial response to an adequate trial of a second generation antidepressant were augmented with a psychostimulant.
A marked improvement in clinical symptoms of depression was noted in all cases, with particular improvement in apathy and feelings of fatigue.
Psychostimulant augmentation of the newer generation antidepressants is a promising new strategy. Further controlled investigation is warranted to explore various aspect of this method.

Abstract: During a 16-month period, nine fatalities occurred among white male drug-addicts, where fentanyl was detected at postmortem toxicological analysis. The street samples associated with these cases confirmed the presence of fentanyl as an additive in low-concentration amphetamine powders with caffeine, phenazone and sugar as cutting agents. In seven of the cases, an acute intoxication by fentanyl was considered to be the immediate cause of death, and in one case, it was likely, but no analysis of fentanyl was performed in blood, and in another case the death was suicide by hanging. This appears to be the first report of a cluster of fentanyl-related deaths outside the United States, and the occurrence of fentanyl in combination with amphetamine has not previously been reported. In addition, in all cases, femoral blood was collected, and samples were handled and analysed according to standardized, quality-controlled procedures. The previous history, circumstances surrounding the death, autopsy findings, histology and toxicology examination of each case are presented. The gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric method for fentanyl is also described. Fentanyl concentrations ranged from 0.5 to 17 ng g-1 blood, and from 5 to 160 ng ml-1 urine. Other drugs found were amphetamine (8 cases), ethanol (5 cases) and benzodiazepines (5 cases). Morphine was found in only one case. The average age of men was 33.9 years (range 22-44); six were found in their own of friend's apartment, two inside buildings (stairways) and one was found outdoors. We conclude that fentanyl is a dangerous substance that should be considered in drug-addict deaths even outside the United States, particularly when the remaining toxicology is unremarkable, and the cause of death cannot be ascertained

Abstract: A young man (22 years old) died of a cardiorespiratory arrest a few hours following admission to the emergency department of a hospital. He was found lying seriously ill in the parking lot of a dance club. Screening of postmortem blood and urine with enzyme multiplied immunoassay (EMIT) detected only amphetamines, caffeine, and cotinine. Further screening of blood, urine, and stomach contents with thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was negative for all three matrices. Specific conditions for amphetamines were used for the gas chromatographic (GC) screening (GC-mass spectrometric [MS] and GC-nitrogen-phosphorus detection). This resulted in the preliminary identification of amphetamine in both blood and urine. Confirmation of the presence of amphetamine in all available postmortem specimens was provided by mass and infrared spectral data (GC-MS and GC-Fourier transform infrared spectrometry) after derivatization. Quantitative results and differentiation between the enantiomers of amphetamine were obtained after chiral derivatization. The calculated concentrations disclosed amphetamine ingestion as the cause of this fatality.

Abstract: A 12-year-old boy on a dextroamphetamine-clonidine-trazodone treatment regimen had a recurrence of insomnia, and his bedtime trazodone dose was doubled from 50 mg to 100 mg. Within 45 mins after taking the first 100-mg trazodone dose on an empty stomach, the patient had a syncopal episode associated with hypotension, bradycardia, and sedation. The drug reaction could have resulted from either trazodone or clonidine, but it is more likely to have resulted from a pharmacodynamic clonidine-trazodone interaction, presumably aggravated by rapid absorption (on an empty stomach) of a recently increased dose of trazodone. It is conceivable but less likely that the psychostimulant was a clinically significant factor. However, a drug interaction between clonidine and D-amphetamine does not need to be postulated to explain this child's syncopal reaction. The authors advise that (1) if trazodone and clonidine are used concurrently, the doses of both agents should be changed slowly, (2) blood pressure and pulse should be carefully monitored at baseline and then periodically during treatment, and (3) administration of trazodone on an empty stomach, and especially dose increases on an empty stomach, should be avoided. Physicians should remain aware that trazodone has the potential to produce hypotension and sedation, especially when combined with other agents (such as clonidine) that might produce the same adverse effects.

Abstract: Specimens that tested positive for amphetamines by immunoassay were confirmed by mass spectrometry. The absence of detectable d-amphetamine (limit of detection at 50 ng/mL) with a positive methamphetamine prompted further testing by chiral derivatization. This data demonstrates that d-amphetamine need not be present in methamphetamine positive cases.

Abstract: Amphetamine abuse is widespread and is frequently encountered in general hospital settings. We have recently seen amphetamine-induced transient psychosis associated with severe self-injurious behavior and self-mutilation. In the setting of bizarre and/or severe self-injurious behavior, screening for amphetamines is indicated.

Abstract: The 3,4-methylenedioxy ring-substituted amphetamines, including "ADAM' and "EVE', are currently popular drugs of abuse. Adverse reactions are reported in the clinical literature but few fatal cases are documented and little toxicological data is available to guide those determining the cause or manner of death in such cases. We report two deaths presenting in a similar manner and with similar clinical features. Various body fluid samples were analysed for amphetamines by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. In one case, amphetamine alone was detected at levels of 1.54 mg/l and 1.47 mg/l in postmortem blood and admission serum, respectively. The other involved several 3,4-methylenedioxy ring-substituted amphetamines, namely MDA, MDMA and MDEA, at levels of 0.25 mg/l, 0.43 mg/l and 0.3 mg/l, respectively in postmortem femoral blood and 0.24 mg/l, 0.55 mg/l and 0.49 mg/l in admission blood. The interpretation of these toxicological results and some novel legal issues are discussed.

Abstract: Of 292 patients (210 males and 82 females) receiving medication for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), 272 (93%) responded well to sustained-release dextroamphetamine (D-Amp) and 21 patients (7%) to sustained-release methylphenidate (MPD). The dose of D-Amp ranged from 0.2 to 3.6 mg/kg/day and the dose of MPD from 1.4 to 7.7 mg/kg/day, without side effects requiring cessation of therapy. This suggests that the clinical improvement rate can be increased to nearly 100% in appropriate situations.

Abstract: Three cases of multiple false-positive drug tests are described. Postmortem urine specimens were screened using the enzyme-multiplied immunoassay technique. All patients had proteinuria and lactic aciduria. These false-positive reactions were due to the presence of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), lactic acid, and protein. This finding was confirmed by creating a multiple false-positive sample with a solution of LDH and lactate in 5% bovine serum albumin at pH 6.

Abstract: Routine methamphetamine testing identified a urine specimen with inconsistent screening and confirmation results. The methamphetamine RIA screening test (Diagnostic Products Corporation) indicated a borderline positive specimen, while the achiral confirmatory GC/MS result showed 4690 ng/mL of methamphetamine and 1895 ng/mL of amphetamine. Analysis of the specimen after derivatization with S(-)-N-trifluoroacetylprolyl chloride showed only the presence of 1-amphetamine and 1-methamphetamine. It was later learned that the individual providing the specimen had been taking Selegiline. Selegiline, (-) propynylmethamphetamine, is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor used for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. It is sold under the trade name Eldepryl. Its major metabolites are 1-methamphetamine, 1-amphetamine and N-desmethylselegiline. Urine specimens from other Selegiline users were obtained and analyzed. A characteristic metabolic pattern was noted, exemplified by a ratio of 1-methamphetamine to 1-amphetamine of about 2.8. This is in contrast to what is observed in the urine of individuals who ingest pure 1-methamphetamine, such as with Vicks Inhaler, where the 1-methamphetamine to 1-amphetamine ratio in the urine is usually greater than 8. Caution is advised when interpreting methamphetamine results without using a chiral identification technique.

Abstract: A relatively enduring and counterintuitive antimanic response to dextroamphetamine in a brain-injured adolescent who had failed trials involving divalproex, lithium, haloperidol, and carbamazepine is described. This finding combined with data from previous reports of antimanic effects of test doses of stimulants imply that such a pharmacological probe may prove relevant for the prediction of treatment response of mania to dextroamphetamine and perhaps for subclassification of bipolar disorder.

Abstract: Amphetamine abuse may be complicated by intracerebral, subdural or subarachnoid haemorrhage. The causative mechanism is probably a combination of vasculitis and induced hypertension. Most cases of intracerebral haemorrhage are subcortical. Only one case of amphetamine-induced intracerebral haematoma where there was also an underlying arteriovenous malformation has been previously reported. We report two cases of intracerebral haematoma due to amphetamine abuse whether an underlying AVM was found at the time of surgery. This possibility should be considered in cases of amphetamine-induced intracerebral haemorrhage.

Abstract: A 37-year-old man had a considerable concentration of methamphetamine in his urine, but he denied taking any abused drug. It was found that he took a pain killer that contains famprofazone, a relatively strong analgesic whose metabolites include methamphetamine and amphetamine. The human urinary metabolism of famprofazone was investigated. Immunoassay was used as a preliminary test, and gas chromatography with flame-ionization detection and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry were used for quantitation and confirmation.

Abstract: We report two case histories of previously healthy patients who both developed persistent dyskinetic syndromes (spasmodic torticollis and cranial dystonia, respectively) following the intake of norpseudoephedrine (NPE) as an appetite suppressant. The symptoms took a chronic course even after NPE intake was discontinued. Similar drug-induced dyskinesias have been described for amphetamine and neuroleptic drugs. This side effect has, however, not yet been reported for NPE, which is pharmacologically related to amphetamine. One of the patients may also have had multiple sclerosis. Structural lesions in the basal ganglia area might predispose the development of such a movement disorder. The potential relationship between NPE intake and the development of dyskinesia is discussed. Appetite suppressants, often taken without the neurologist's knowledge, may be the cause of dyskinetic syndromes.

Abstract: Historical changes in forensic psychiatric evaluation on criminal responsibility and proceedings in psychopathological findings of amphetamine psychosis are reviewed at first. The classification of amphetamine related mental disorders are proposed in 6 types. Among them, the clinical characteristics and psychopathological features of "Anxiety-situational reaction type" (Fukushima) are described. According to some reasonable grounds, offenders diagnosed as anxiety-situational reaction type should be evaluated as diminished responsibility in place of irresponsibility. Finally, two cases of murder committed under the influence of amphetamine, are reported in detail.

Abstract: We report a congenital anomalous fetus with holoprosencephaly, prenatally diagnosed by sonography and MR scan at the twenty-sixth week during the gestational period. Chromosome analysis by amniocentesis revealed trisomy 13 (47,XY,+13). The diagnosis was confirmed by autopsy. After induction, external examination showed a proboscis-like nose on the normal nose position. The right foot showed polydactylia with wide separation of the fifth and sixth toes. We found that the mother was an abuser of amphetamine at an early gestational age. The teratogenic effect of D-amphetamine on animals has been noted, but no previous clinical case of a congenital anomalous fetus and maternal abuse of amphetamine has been reported. This case report is the first to reveal holoprosencephaly and trisomy 13, with maternal early gestational abuse of amphetamine.

Abstract: A 42-year-old man developed acute myocardial infarction 20 minutes following transnasal inhalation of amphetamine. To our knowledge, no cases of amphetamine-induced myocardial infarction by transnasal inhalation have ever been reported. Consequently its pharmacological effects on the cardiovascular system are discussed.

Abstract: Various blood samples were collected from heart cavities and blood vessels in eight autopsy cases of people who had been methamphetamine abusers. Methamphetamine and its metabolite, amphetamine, were determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-selected ion monitoring. In four cases where left and right heart blood samples were collected, methamphetamine concentrations in the left heart blood samples were 1.9-2.6 times higher than those in the right heart blood samples. In three cases where pulmonary vein blood samples were collected, methamphetamine concentrations in the pulmonary vein blood samples were higher than those in other blood samples sites. To interpret the blood methamphetamine concentrations, site dependence should be taken into consideration.

Abstract: A patient who sustained a major burn following abuse with Ecstasy and Whizz is described. His progress was complicated by hyperpyrexia, acute renal failure and convulsions, all of which have been recently recognized as potential side-effects of Ecstasy abuse. This report further highlights the dangers of substance abuse.

Abstract: Three patients with history of documented hypotension, near syncope, or syncope before or after the administration of isoproterenol during head-up tilt table are reported. Severe bradycardia was also noted in one patient. All three patients responded to the administration of 2.5 mg of oral dextroamphetamine 45 minutes prior to a repeat head-up tilt table study. The potent central and peripheral adrenergic agonist pharmacological properties of this drug permitted the prevention of severe vasodepressor syncope in these patients.

Abstract: A 37 year-old man with an ischaemic stroke after the nasal use of amphetamine and caffeine is reported. Transient arterial hypertension due to these agents may have been the mediator of the stroke. Mitral annular calcification was the only other abnormality found, and was thought not to play an important role in this patient. There was no evidence of a primary or secondary hypercoagulable state. Stroke due to nasal use of these agents appears not to have been previously reported (Medline literature search 1983-1993).

Abstract: MR images and three dimensional surface images (3-D images) using N-isopropyl-p-[I-123] iodoamphetamine (I-123 IMP) were obtained in a patient who acknowledged using thinner and amphetamine. While MR images could not find any definite abnormality, 3-D images with I-123 IMP demonstrated multifocal defects. 3-D images with I-123 IMP might be able to detect an early abnormality in brain perfusion in a drug abuser.

Abstract: The study of genes, drugs, and behavior in three male adolescents with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) revealed a clinical profile that raises questions about the indications for neuroleptic and appetite-suppressing medications in this condition. Evidence of the inadvisability of neuroleptic medication and of the pathophysiology of PWS has led to a remarkable control of violent outbursts and hyperphagia by carbamazepine in one patient afflicted with both PWS and Klinefelter's syndrome. Testosterone and behavioral therapy proved to be useful in the management of two patients. The present observations, which are supported by recent advances in the pathophysiology of satiety, suggest that PWS should be understood as a metabolic disorder and subjected to psychopharmacogenetic study.

Abstract: A case study was made of a 23-year-old female with simultaneous bilateral infectious corneal ulcers related to extended-wear soft contact lenses. Cultures revealed Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Multiple high risk factors were combined, including extended-wear, poor lens care, bilateral alternate wearing, and smoking. Amphetamine addiction may also have played a role. After treatment, a visual acuity of 20/20 was achieved in both eyes by the use of rigid gas-permeable contact lenses.

Abstract: The use of psychostimulants as antidepressants remains controversial in the field of psychiatry. While methylphenidate hydrochloride (MPH) and dextroamphetamine (DA) are often considered to be equivalent drugs, differences in their neurobiologic mechanism of action may account for different clinical response patterns. Hence, clinical trials and literature reviews that examine the antidepressant efficacy of psychostimulants without distinguishing between MPH and DA may reach inaccurate conclusions. This paper is a critical review of controlled and uncontrolled studies examining the use of MPH as an antidepressant. We discuss the methodologic limitations of existing placebo-controlled trials that have reached mixed conclusions about the efficacy of MPH as an antidepressant. These studies are offset by uncontrolled open trials and clinical case reports that endorse the drug's effectiveness in alleviating depressive symptoms. The series of patients we treated with MPH demonstrates the safety and efficacy of this drug in alleviating depressive symptoms in the medically ill elderly with a variety of mood disorders. Reviewing these six cases and balancing the positive and negative reports in the literature, we provide practical guidelines for identifying patients who are potential candidates for treatment with MPH.

Abstract: Responses of four learning disabled children who showed dramatic improvements to one or more antimotion-sickness-antihistamines and -stimulants are described qualitatively. These cases were selected from a prior quantitative study in which three antihistamines (meclizine, cyclizine, dimenhydrinate) and three stimulants (pemoline, methylphenidate, dextroamphetamine) were tested in variable combinations (using a specific clinical method) for favorable responses by 100 children characterized by diagnostic evidence of learning disabilities and cerebellar-vestibular dysfunctioning. Pending validation in double-blind controlled studies, these qualitative results suggest that the "cerebellar-vestibular (CV) stabilizing" antimotion-sickness medications, Piracetam included, and their combinations may be shown to be therapeutically useful in treating children with learning disabilities or dyslexia and attention deficit disorder.

Abstract: This study investigates how deficits in attention and impulse control are reflected in the social and cognitive play of a 4-year-old boy with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. In addition, an A-B-A-B reversal design was employed to evaluate the effectiveness of dextroamphetamine (2.5 mg, twice a day) for treatment of preschool attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. The most dramatic effects of medication were observed on the level of sustained attention and the pattern of cognitive play. Sustained attention during play and in a structured group activity improved, and play became more sequentially organized and symbolic. Results are discussed with respect to the following: 1) attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and preschool play; 2) the efficacy of psychostimulant medication; and 3) the adequacy of teacher ratings versus direct observation in measuring medication response.

Abstract: Amphetamine poisoning is rare in children. Here we report two male infants with acute poisoning due to accidental amphetamine ingestion. One infant had a family history of drug abuse and the other was due to poor supervision of the parents. Although typical clinical symptoms and signs (including restlessness, hyperactivity, hypertension, tachycardia and tachypnea....etc.) were found, both were completely recovered after treatment. The principle of management of amphetamine poisoning are presented.

Abstract: Ischemic colitis can be caused by a variety of medications including a number of sympathomimetic agents. We report the case of a 47-year-old narcoleptic man who had abdominal pain and rectal bleeding. The clinical, radiographic, and histologic findings supported the diagnosis of ischemic colitis associated with oral dextroamphetamine use.

Abstract: Medically ill patients who show signs of depression may have problems with traditional antidepressant therapy, because of the side effect profile and the delayed onset of action of these agents. Psychostimulants such as methylphenidate and dextroamphetamine are another treatment option. The beneficial effects of these drugs are usually noted within 36 hours, and drug habituation is generally not a problem. The primary obstacle to the use of these agents for depression in medically ill patients is the hesitancy of physicians to prescribe them.

Abstract: A review of the literature and our experience suggest that attention deficit hyperactivity disorder does not necessarily disappear in adolescence but may persist into adult life. Detection of the disorder later in life may be made more difficult when it is masked by other diagnostic labels. Once the disorder has been identified in the adult, however, proper intervention with psychotherapy and medical management can make a significant difference in the patient's life.

Abstract: Three patients are described who developed either pneumomediastinum or "clicking pneumothorax" after abusing illicit drugs. In recent years, patients presenting with pneumomediastinum after abusing cocaine have been frequently reported; these patients are most commonly young males with pleuritic chest pain. Seventy-three percent have detectable subcutaneous emphysema and fifty percent have a Hamman's sign. The pathophysiology, presenting features, and treatment of patients with barotrauma related to inhalational drug abuse are reviewed.

Abstract: The use of the psychostimulants in psychiatry is reviewed. A brief historical perspective on dextroamphetamine is presented, and a brief review of the psychopharmacology of dextroamphetamine, methylphenidate and magnesium pemoline is given. The literature on the use of stimulants in the treatment of resistant depression, apathetic geriatric patients and patients medically ill with a secondary depression is summarized and two case histories given to illustrate the clinical usefulness of the stimulants. The literature on the use of stimulants as an adjunct to antidepressant therapy and as a diagnostic test is also discussed. Finally the use of stimulants in obsessional illness and adult attention deficit disorder is summarized. The writer concludes by commenting that the stimulants have a very useful role in the treatment of certain categories of depression as well as other psychiatric syndromes and such patients should not be deprived of symptom relief by these drugs. The approach to therapy should be much the same as the use of analgesics for chronic pain sufferers.

Abstract: The use of CNS stimulant medication for the treatment of attention deficit disorder with hyperactivity (ADDH) in subnormal intelligence children remains controversial, and the majority of the literature does not support the use of CNS stimulants in these children, although the choice of dependent variables and research designs may have contributed to this outcome. A single case research design was used to assess the effectiveness of CNS stimulant medication (methylphenidate and dextroamphetamine) in three subnormal intelligence children with ADDH, using excessive movement and on-task behaviors as dependent variables. The results and implications for future research are discussed.

Abstract: An amphetamine-abusing mother who had taken methamphetamine 5 hours before beginning labor gave birth to twins who died 1 to 2 hours after birth; an autopsy and toxicological examination were performed. The results are consistent with previous findings of premature delivery and retarded intrauterine development. Tissue distribution shows a similar pattern to an earlier reported case, though drug concentrations are about 10 times higher.

Abstract: A 40-year-old man, who had regularly taken illicit amphetamine by intra-nasal inhalation for several years without ill effects, was admitted to hospital with signs of massive adrenergic overstimulation shortly after inhaling material which he had purchased in the belief that it was amphetamine. The administration of the beta-blocker practolol produced a paradoxical increase in blood pressure. After his discharge from hospital he suffered disabling feelings of anxiety for several weeks. Analysis of a sample of the material showed it to contain p-methyl amphetamine and N, p-dimethyl amphetamine.

Abstract: Nondeprived, male Syrian hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) were adapted to a daily schedule of 2-hr access to a 10% sucrose solution. Two benzodiazepines, midazolam (1.0-10 mg/kg) and flurazepam (1.0-10 mg/kg), produced dose-dependent increases in sucrose consumption. In contrast, the alpha 2-adrenergic agonist, clonidine (0.01-0.3 mg/kg), had no effect on sucrose intake. Neither d-fenfluramine nor d-amphetamine affected sucrose ingestion in the hamsters, except at a large dose (10 mg/kg). Nevertheless, significant, dose-dependent reductions in sucrose consumption were observed after the administration of either opiate antagonists (naltrexone; nalmefene) or selective dopamine D2 receptor agonists (N-0437; quinpirole). The results are compared and contrasted with previously reported data for rats.

Abstract: Substance abuse among the mentally ill has become increasingly prominent. This article describes the problems presented by dual diagnosis patients in the urban, publicly funded, psychiatric emergency room. When such patients become acutely ill, neither the public health system nor the mental health clinician is adequately prepared to provide care. The inability to effectively treat these patients has become strikingly clear in recent years. In 1986, the Psychiatric Emergency Service at San Francisco General Hospital began to overflow with patients who required overnight stays. The intoxicated substance abusers with acute psychiatric complaints were the most difficult to manage clinically and administratively. Suggestions are offered for innovative approaches to this group of public patients: dual training of clinicians, flexible treatment programs prepared to deal with the whole person, and public funding that reflects patients' needs rather than clinicians' preferences.

Abstract: A method is presented for the simultaneous identification and quantification of several CNS stimulants, including amphetamine in plasma and urine by GC/FID using mephentermine as an internal standard. No derivation is necessary and after a single alkaline extraction, GC analysis for the 11 compounds tested is achieved in 23 min. The lower limit of detectability was found to be 4 ng/ml for amphetamine in plasma. This method is sensitive, reproducible, selective and applicable in forensic and clinical toxicological analyses. Toxicological findings, after a fatality involving phendimetrazine are presented as an application of the procedure.

Abstract: The authors describe 10 patients who developed panic attacks only after substantial cocaine use. The timing of the onset of symptoms, i.e., after 1-6 years of cocaine use, and the fact that only one patient had a first-degree relative with panic disorder were more suggestive of acquired than primary panic disorder. The patients' atypical symptoms and responses to medications may be explained in terms of limbic-neuronal hyperexcitability induced by cocaine through a kindling mechanism.

Abstract: A 36-year-old man was admitted because of sopor and dark urine after intravenous amphetamine injection. He subsequently developed myoglobinuria and acute renal failure. Serum myoglobin value was remarkably elevated to 83,000 ng/ml, and urine myoglobin was 400,000 ng/ml. Renal biopsy revealed tubular degeneration and tubular obstruction with myoglobin casts by immunofluorescence examination. Amphetamine-induced rhabdomyolysis was suspected to cause myoglobinuric acute renal failure.

Abstract: The author reviews the literature reporting the untoward effects of withdrawing monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). The withdrawal of these agents can result in severe anxiety, agitation, pressured speech, sleeplessness or drowsiness, hallucinations, delirium and paranoid psychosis. MAOI withdrawal phenomena resemble the symptoms produced by the discontinuation of chronically administered psychostimulants. The capacity of MAOI to exert amphetamine-like effects presynaptically, and the propensity of somatic treatments for depression to subsensitize presynaptic receptors regulating the release of catecholamines, can provide a basis for the development of psychotic syndromes upon the withdrawal of MAOIs. Evidence for this hypothesis is reviewed.

Abstract: Four depressed and cognitively impaired patients with HIV-related disease had a marked therapeutic response to treatment with psychostimulants. Use of dextroamphetamine and methylphenidate brought a prompt remission of depressive and cognitive dysfunctions without adverse side effects. The results suggest the need for further evaluation of psychostimulants in the treatment of HIV patients whose depression proceeds from an affective disturbance (either primary or secondary) or from a specific organic mental disorder. The importance of neuropsychiatric assessment of depressed HIV patients is stressed, and diagnostic and treatment guidelines are given.

Abstract: Phendimetrazine is an anorectic agent which recently has been detected in three medical examiner's cases. In one instance death was attributed to this drug. Methods of detecting and identifying this drug in urine and blood are discussed. In the one instance where death was attributed to this substance, the blood concentration was 300 ng/ml.

Abstract: The psychostimulant drugs methylphenidate (MPH) and dextroamphetamine (DEA) have proven efficacy in clinical populations whose primary symptoms include disorders of attention, impulse control, and locomotor hyperactivity. These medications have also been shown to influence in a positive manner cognitive functioning, particularly in the areas of sustained attention and memory. In light of these facts, the psychostimulants MPH and DEA were administered in separate trials to a young man who suffered from similar symptoms secondary to a chronic closed head injury. The medication trials were double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-response studies. Cognitive functions, particularly memory and attention, improved in the active drug conditions. In addition, there was a consistent, positive drug effect across behavioral assessments. This case study emphasizes the importance of studying psychostimulant effects in patients with neuropsychological and behavioral sequelae of closed head injury; it also presents an appropriate methodology for evaluating psychostimulant effects in a clinical research setting.

Abstract: Migraine is considered to be a functional neurological disorder. In classical migraine (headache associated with prodromal visual field disturbances) and migraine accompagnée (headache associated with transient neurological symptoms), disturbances of cerebral blood flow and amine metabolism are thought to be pathogenetic factors. However, conventional methods of neuroimaging (CAT, NMR) usually do not yield any pathological findings in patients. Since 123I-iodoamphetamine (123I-IMP) crosses the intact blood brain barrier, 123I-IMP-SPECT is used for the assessment of cerebral perfusion in various neurological diseases, including functional disorders. 123I-IMP-SPECT was performed on 5 patients with classical migraine and 18 patients with migraine accompagnée. At the time of investigation, all patients were symptom-free. Cerebral blood flow was decreased in all patients with migraine accompagnée, and often corresponded to the site of headache as well as to the topography of transient neurological symptoms. This reduction was most obvious in a patient with persisting neurological symptoms. Most patients with classical migraine, however, did not show any alteration of cerebral perfusion. It appears that migraine--and in particular migraine accompagnée--is characterized by a permanent alteration not only of cerebral blood flow but also of neuronal activity. Migraine attacks may occur in connection with exacerbations of preexisting metabolic alterations.

Abstract: Two hyperactive boys who had developed motor and phonic tics during stimulant treatment reacted similarly to low doses of haloperidol and thioridazine. Neuroleptic-induced tics may be a consequence of presynaptic dopamine blockade.

Abstract: A 28-year-old male methamphetamine abuser, who had been buried for 5 years after being killed by strangulation, was found skeletonized. Methamphetamine and amphetamine in the significantly denatured fatty material of the bone marrow were analyzed by gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The confirmation of the chemicals was carried out by chemical ionization (CI) mass chromatography, CI mass spectrometry and CI mass fragmentography. The concentrations of methamphetamine and amphetamine determined by CI mass fragmentography were 1.0 mumol/100 g and 0.1 mumol/100 g, respectively. The method used would seem to be very useful for determination of methamphetamine and amphetamine in marked putrefied biological materials.

Abstract: Patients with "treatment resistant" depression who do not respond to standard methods or relapse over time have a moral and legitimate right to innovative therapy. Combined treatment with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and stimulants has been resisted by practitioners because of hypertensive and hyperthermic crises noted in certain cases. This paper reports a case series demonstrating the safety and efficacy of adding a stimulant to an MAOI or to a combination of TCA and MAOI in the treatment of intractable depression.

Abstract: Two intravenous amphetamine abusers had fatal, rapidly progressive cerebral mucormycosis with abscess formation in the presence of absolute lymphopenia. Postmortem examination confirmed the primary nature of the fungal cerebritis, documented by postmortem culture and histology. The clinical and pathologic features of these cases are compared to previously reported occurrences of primary fungal cerebritis (and abscess) among intravenous drug abusers, including cocaine users. Primary fungal cerebritis associated with intravenous abuse of stimulant drugs is discussed as a possible variant of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.

Abstract: We evaluated methods for comparing the effects of dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine), thioridazine (Mellaril), and contingency management in the control of severe behavior problems. A reversal design was used in which medications were systematically titrated and assessed in unstructured as well as structured settings with three clients. Subsequently, behavioral procedures including timeout, differential reinforcement of other behavior, and visual screening, were used in a multiple-baseline design across settings. The assessment and design methods were useful in comparing the interventions. Dextroamphetamine decreased inappropriate behaviors and improved academic behaviors in one client, but no reliable effects were observed in the other two clients. Thioridazine was variable across clients, settings, behaviors, and dosages. Contingency management produced consistent decreases in inappropriate behaviors and small improvements in academic performance.

Abstract: Two patients are presented whose chronic urticaria had previously failed to improve with antihistamine therapy or glucocorticoids. Both demonstrated marked improvement with dextroamphetamine sulfate. Both patients also had idiopathic orthostatic edema for which the treatment of choice is amphetamines. When treatment was discontinued the urticarial lesions returned, only to decrease significantly again when therapy was resumed. Whether the response to amphetamines in chronic urticaria is unique to patients with idiopathic orthostatic edema or will also prove to be effective in treating typical idiopathic urticaria will be determined by future research.

Abstract: A case is presented of callosal syndrome following cerebral hemorrhage and amphetamine abuse in a 26-year-old right-handed man. There were few hemispheric findings but a full callosal syndrome including left apraxia to verbal commands, left tactile anomia, left agraphia, right constructional apraxia, failure of blindfolded side-to-side hand replication and form-board testing showing loss of interhemispheric transmission including intermanual interference. The "draw-a-clock" test showed left inattention when drawn with the right hand but not the left, and perseveration was noted for spatial tasks done with the right hand and symbolic tasks done with the left. The patient recovered functionally almost completely but testing demonstrated continued loss of interhemispheric transmission. The case is considered of most interest for its potential in explaining phenomena observed in severe unilateral hemispheric lesions. Our findings suggest that perseveration is not a dysfunction of the damaged portion of the brain, but a phenomenon associated with intact brain attempting unfamiliar tasks. The persistence of left hemi-inattention is attributed to the inability of the left hemisphere to utilize spatial information to compensate for the phenomenon of inattention. Left-sided dyskinesia following left hemisphere lesions was attributed to the lack of symbolic information necessary to perform some movements. Dysprosody was attributed to lack of tonal information to the left hemisphere. Recovery of function following severe unilateral lesions may be largely due to compensatory learning by the intact hemisphere and assertion of ipsilateral control. As our patient originally assumed an inverted left-handed writing posture, we assume the posture is controlled by the right hemisphere.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Abstract: We have reported a case of Serratia marcescens arthritis and osteomyelitis in a young man whose source of infection appeared to be a single episode of intravenous amphetamine use. Multiple antibiotics and aggressive surgical management were necessary to effect a cure. He eventually responded to a three-week course of amikacin and moxalactam given in conjunction with surgical debridement of all involved areas.

Abstract: This report describes a man with narcolepsy, paranoid psychosis, major depression, and tardive dyskinesia. The case illustrates the treatment difficulties such a patient presents and also raises questions about interactions between the putative neurotransmitters involved in each of these conditions. It is suggested that the presence of narcolepsy may facilitate the appearance of unwanted effects of antidepressants and neuroleptics such as psychosis and depression.

Abstract: Carbamazepine-induced mania is described in two case reports of prepubertal boys, one of whom also developed manic symptoms after receiving imipramine and dextroamphetamine. The structural and chemical similarities between carbamazepine and polycyclic antidepressants are discussed and it is suggested that caution and close observation be employed when using carbamazepine to treat children who have been identified as being at risk for developing this adverse effect.

Abstract: Stimulant medications enhance performance on attentional, memory, and perceptual laboratory tasks and improve behavior in the majority of children with attention deficit disorder with hyperactivity. Most investigators, however, fail to find academic improvement. This report presents two cases in which stimulant medication in the context of multimodal treatment led to considerable gain in academic performance. One case was diagnosed as a combination of attention deficit disorder with hyperactivity and overanxious disorder of childhood. In the other case, disordered conduct was the complicating factor. The necessity of using a multimodal approach in children who suffer from multiple behavioral impairments is emphasized.

Abstract: A 57-year-old man with bronchogenic squamous cell carcinoma developed an autonomic neuropathy following treatment with a chemotherapy combination which included cisplatin. The autonomic neuropathy resolved following discontinuation of the cisplatin and treatment with dextroamphetamine. The following case represents a patient with bronchogenic carcinoma treated with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and cisplatin, who developed a severe autonomic neuropathy following chemotherapy administration. This is the first report of cisplatin-associated autonomic neuropathy to appear in the literature.

Abstract: The effective therapeutic response to dextroamphetamine and methylphenidate by five depressed patients with neurological disease is described. In four of these patients tricyclic antidepressants had to be discontinued due to the concomitant deterioration of their cognitive functions, and in one case they were not used due to cardiovascular complications. There was a rapid remission of depressive symptomatology with no adverse side effects, consistent with the findings of other investigators. The possible association of right hemisphere strokes and depression is also discussed. Further evaluation of the therapeutic role of psychostimulants in the treatment of depressed patients with structurally-compromised brain function is recommended.

Abstract: A 32-year-old man had acute renal failure after ingesting amphetamines. The renal biopsy findings indicated acute interstitial nephritis. In contrast to other reports, which indicate an association between coexisting rhabdomyolysis, hyperpyrexia, or necrotizing angiitis and acute renal failure in amphetamine abusers, our case suggests that amphetamine alone may cause acute renal injury.

Abstract: The excretion of amphetamine in human breast milk was studied in a nursing mother with narcolepsy, who was treated with 20 mg daily of a racemic preparation of amphetamine. The concentration of amphetamine was 3 and 7 times higher in breast milk than in maternal plasma on the 10th and 42nd days after delivery. Small amounts of amphetamine were found in urine samples from the infant.

Abstract: Pragmatic, empirical methods are available for the diagnosis and treatment of narcolepsy. Diagnosis can be based on the history of specific symptoms; a questionnaire scale can reliably confirm sleepiness, while performance tests and other laboratory procedures may illuminate the clinical picture when the diagnosis is unclear. A treatment program includes scheduling of sleep and naps, careful progressive refinement of the drug regimen, dependable record keeping, and supportive or insight-oriented psychotherapy aimed at enhancing adherence to prescribed regimens.

Abstract: A double-blind controlled study of the effects on semen quality of 4 alpha-adrenergic agents with and without antihistamines was conducted in a patient who had failure of emission secondary to retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy for testis cancer. No other controlled studies are available. All of the alpha-adrenergic drugs allowed the patient to produce an ejaculate. The effects were similar. The addition of antihistamine did not improve the semen quality. Four days of treatment were consistently more effective than a single dose, especially for sperm motility. A pregnancy resulted. It is concluded that long-term treatment with alpha-adrenergic drugs is indicated in men with failure of emission secondary to retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy.

Abstract: A positive therapeutic response to d-amphetamine is described in three medically ill depressed patients in a general hospital. Two patients were either unable to tolerate or responded poorly to tricyclic antidepressants. In one patient, d-amphetamine was chosen because of the combination of postoperative pain and depression. There was a rapid remission of depressive symptomatology with no adverse side effects, consistent with the findings of other investigators. Further evaluation of the therapeutic role of d-amphetamine in the treatment of medically ill depressed patients is recommended.

Abstract: Paranoid psychosis may result from intoxication with, or withdrawal from amphetamines. The authors describe two cases of paranoid confusional psychosis commencing 1 week after the patients' withdrawal from sympathomimetic amines. The pathophysiology for this unusual disorder may be agonist-induced dopamine receptor hypersensitivity.

Abstract: The serendipitous findings of an unusual case of self-labeled transsexualism and amphetamine abuse are presented. The patient, a white male, reported transsexual episodes only after intravenous injection of metamphetamines. At all other times, he considered himself masculine and never entertained cross-gender fantasies or wishes for sex reassignment surgery. Hypotheses are raised which suggest a possible neurochemical explanation for this man's transsexual episodes.

Abstract: The case of a 61-year-old woman with an apathetic depression and urinary incontinence is presented. Her depression and urinary incontinence were symptomatically treated with d-amphetamine prior to diagnosis of bilateral frontal lobe meningiomas. Similar but irreversible neurologic conditions might be successfully treated by using amphetamines.

Abstract: Agoraphobia, now a clinically accepted entity (DSM-III) was first described more than 100 years ago in the psychiatric literature. Recently, it has been considered a syndrome, with phobia, anxiety and depersonalization being the prominent symptoms. Its etiology is not clear and different schools of thought have given different explanations for its causation. Few reports of recent origin have have described a close association between the intake and/or discontinuation of pharmacologic agents and the onset of the syndrome. The agents implicated were the tricyclic group. Our report describes another "antidepressant," d-amphetamine, which when discontinued by our patient, was followed by the full syndrome of agoraphobia.

Abstract: Following treatment with stimulant medications for symptoms of attention deficit disorder, Gilles de la Tourette's syndrome occurred in 15 patients. Early signs of Tourette's syndrome may be difficult to distinguish from hyperactive and attention disordered symptoms, leading the clinician to consider treatment with stimulants. In these Tourette's-susceptible patients, stimulants may exacerbate severe motor and phonic tics, requiring discontinuation of administration of stimulants and institution of haloperidol therapy for tic control. Clinical evaluation for tics and Tourette's syndrome in children and their families should precede and dictate use of stimulant medications in children.

Abstract: Four cases are described to demonstrate the extrapyramidal clinical syndrome sometimes appearing in chronic amphetamine users. The symptoms are dominated by choreiform or athetoid movements, ataxia and disturbances of gait. The syndrome develops during amphetamine abuse and may be observed also during abstinence. The symptoms usually disappear within a week when the drug is discontinued, but may remain for years.

Abstract: Acute chorea in a child followed ingestion of pemoline mesylate. In guinea pigs, in an experimental model of chorea, chronic administration of pemoline induced behavioral supersensitivity to other dopaminergic agonists. Pemoline is similar to both d-amphetamine and methylphenidate in altering central dopaminergic sensitivity, and may cause chorea by similar mechanisms. Chronic pemoline therapy may offer no significant advantage over therapy with other indirect dopamine agonists.

Abstract: Four patients had high serum thyroxine (T4) concentrations during periods of heavy amphetamine abuse. After amphetamine was withdrawn, serum T4 returned to normal. Administration of amphetamine to monkeys induced a rise in serum T4; in this model the high T4 level appeared to be caused by increased serum thyrotropin. The mechanism of this effect is unclear but is presumably mediated via the hypothalamus. Awareness of transient hyperthyroxinemia due to amphetamine may allow the physician to avoid confusion with true thyrotoxicosis.

Abstract: The regional cerebral blood flow (133Xe-inhalation method) was measured during acute amphetamine intoxication in a male 25 years old addict. During the study the patient displayed symptoms of paranoia and slight euphoria and tension. The flow level was found to be elevated by about 30% compared to a study in non-intoxicated state. The augmentation was most marked in the left hemisphere and in frontal regions (local increases up to 100%). The results confirm earlier findings in animal models and indicate the central role of frontal cortical structures in the production of psychotic symptoms.

Abstract: The actions of haloperidol, dextroamphetamine sulfate, levamfetamine succinate, apomorphine, and piribedil were studied in two patients with Giles de la Tourette's disease in an attempt to clarify the catecholamine mechanisms involved in this condition. Both dextroamphetamine and levamfetamine increased the severity of the symptoms; dextroamphetamine was more potent. Haloperidol controlled the symptoms and also antagonized the effect of dextroamphetamine. Apomorphine injections reduced the severity of symptoms, even in the presence of dextroamphetamine. We conclude that dopamine rather than norepinephrine is the principal catecholamine responsible for the symptoms. The effect of apomorphine may be understood through its action on postulated presynaptic inhibitory dopamine receptors, or other presynaptic mechanisms of action.

Abstract: A case of tranylcypromine overdose is reported. Tranylcypromine, amphetamine methamphetamine and phenylethylamine were detected in the plasma by gas chromatography and their identity confirmed by mass spectrometry. The data suggested that the amphetamines were metabolic products of tranylcypromine. Platelet monoamine oxidase activity was more than 95% inhibited during the 72 h after the overdose despite complete clinical recovery by that time. The possible role of amphetamines and phenylethylamine in causing the clinical manifestations of tranylcypromine overdose is discussed.

Abstract: The observation of a patient suffering from a parkinsonian syndrome, almost entirely expressed on the right side, and "on-off" attacks with rotatory movement of the trunk, led us to consider that the rotational model of animals may be reproduced in man. The symptoms presented by our patient may reflect a predominant degeneration in the nigrostriatal pathway of the left side. We suggest that his torsion behavior is due to hypersensitivity phenomenon of the dopaminergic receptors on this side.

Abstract: Phenytoin administration occasionally leads to the induction of hyperkinetic movement disorders. The pathophysiologic basis of this phenomena is unknown, but thought to be a toxic effect of phenytoin. Study of two cases of this disorder and a review of the literature suggest that antecedant pathologic changes in the basal ganglia are prerequisites for the development of phenytoin-induced hyperkinesias. In an animal model of tardive dyskinesia, phenytoin was found to enhance neuroleptic-induced behavioral supersensitivity but have no effect in control animals. We conclude that phenytoin induced hyperkinesias reflect a specific effect of phenytoin on an abnormal neural substrate and suggest the presence of an otherwise silent pathological alteration of the corpus striatum. The diagnostic value of an episode of phenytoin-induced hyperkinesia is discussed.

Abstract: The authors present a case to illustrate a model of drug-induced psychosis wherein the drug acts as if it fits with some neurobiological predisposition in the patient. Patients with a good interpersonal developmental history but extreme sensitivity to a psychotomimetic drug may provide a model for neurobiological vulnerability to psychosis.

Abstract: Gilles de la Tourette's syndrome was independently ascertained in two male cousins once removed. Previous studies have shown familial clustering of individuals with tics, but no consistent pattern of inheritance of Tourette's syndrome has been apparent. The onset and later exacerbation of symptoms in our younger patient were associated with the administration of CNS stimulants given for excessive motor activity. The adverse effects of methylphenidate and dextroamphetamine therapy on Tourette's syndrome supports the hypothesis that this condition results from a relative excess of CNS catecholaminergic activity. Physicians prescribing these agents should inquire about the presence of tics in patients and their families.

Abstract: The authors conducted an extensive pharmacological analysis of a patient severely affected by tardive dyskinesia. No drug treatment gave lasting clinical improvement. Several agents recently recommended for this condition, dimethyl aminoethanol, clozapine, and thioridazine, failed to modify the dyskinesia. Reserpine caused a worsening of the symptoms. A paradoxical and unexpected improvement was observed with apomorphine injections and with low-dosage oral L-dopa. These two drugs may have acted by stimulating presynaptic inhibitory dopamine receptors.

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated suppressed growth of height and weight in children receiving stimulant drugs for hyperactivity. For approximately twelve months, growth data and food records were collected on two subjects receiving different types and dosages of stimulant drugs. The two cases demonstrated that dextroamphetamine levels of 10 mg. or more and methylphenidate levels of 30 mg. or more decreased caloric intake significantly. This decrease may be limiting for long-term growth. Both subjects had a variety of feeding problems due to poor appetite. Careful nutritional evaluation and planning are important to insure optimal energy and nutrient intake in these children receiving stimulant drugs.

Abstract: Cyclizine was observed to induce generalized chorea in a patient with mild lingual-facial-buccal dyskinesias. The mechanism for this action was shown to be cyclizine's central anticholinergic activity. This was consistent with previous findings that acetycholine antagonists can lower the threshold for appearance of abnormal choreatic movements related to dopaminergic mechanisms by alteration of the dopamine/acetylcholine balance in the corpus striatum. Furthermore, our study was supportive of the hypothesis that spontaneous lingual-facial-buccal dyskinesias in the elderly may be the mildest manifestations of senile chorea.

Abstract: A patient is presented who developed angiitis associated with intravenous usage of amphetamine. Her disease exacerbated after further amphetamine usage and progressed, over a two-year period, to terminal renal failure. Various etiologic possibilities are discussed, and it is suggested that amphetamine-induced angiitis is a distinct clinical entity that is potentially lethal.

Abstract: In view of its therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of children with minimal brain dysfunction syndrome, dextroamphetamine was administered to a young adult with a chronic organic brain syndrome secondary to cerebral trauma. That D-amphetamine was critical to the resulting marked diminution in confusion, paranoia, and deficit in short term memory was confirmed by the occurrence of a relapse coincident with placebo administration as part of a double blind evaluation. Amitriptylline appeared to potentiate the therapeutic effects of D-amphetamine. The results achieved, although observational and subjective in nature, warrant replication in controlled, quantitative clinical studies.

Abstract: The separate and combined effects of stimulant drugs, placebos, and behavior therapy were investigated with two hyperactive boys. In each case, sequential replacement of drugs (Ritalin and Dexedrine) with placebos demonstrated placebo effects of the drugs; behavior therapy, alone and in combination with drugs, was effective in controlling hyperactive behaviors. Implications in regard to drugs as treatment of choice are discussed.

Abstract: Electromyographic (EMG) biofeedback, for the relaxation of specific throat and facial muscles, was given to a woodwind musician. The patient had a nineteen-year history of tics and high levels of tension in his throat and facial muscles. Eventurally these problems progressed to a point that interfered with his ability to perform as a professional woodwind musician. Following detoxification from alcohol and Dexamyl, and after a period of psychotherapy, EMG biofeedback relaxation training was started for the muscles specifically showing chronically high tension levels. The EMG training consisted of four phases designed to help the patient progressively lower tension and generalize these newly learned techniques to his professional life. He had a total of twenty treatments of approximately 45 minutes each. This procedure resulted in dramatic reductions in tension levels of the specific throat and facial muscles along with increased proficiency as a musician and in psychological functioning.

Abstract: A case of acute (toxic) epidermal necrolysis is reported in the dental literature for the first time. This severe, life-threatening mucocutaneous syndrome resembles severely scalded skin. Sloughing vesiculobullous oral lesions are a frequent component. Staphylococcus aureus and drug reactions may cause separate entities presenting clinically as acute epidermal necrolysis. This case of drug-induced epidermal necrolysis ina child was successfully treated with methicillin and hydrocortisone.
