Abstract: We report a case of a 63-year-old patient with psychiatric symptoms diagnosed with coexisting DiGeorge syndrome, Fahr syndrome and Turner syndrome. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of coexistence of DiGeorge syndrome and mosaic Turner syndrome. Basal ganglia calcification, known as Fahr syndrome, may develop in patients with DiGeorge syndrome as a consequence of calcium-phosphate balance disturbances resulting from primary hypoparathyroidism. A deletion of chromosome 22q11.2 in DiGeorge syndrome, basal ganglia calcification and, according to some research, mosaic Turner syndrome independently can lead to psychiatric disorders. A leading clinical manifestation of the genetic diseases in our patient was long-term, drug-resistant depression with sleeping disorders and organic hallucinosis. Affective disorders led the patient to attempt suicide. The aim of the study was to highlight the importance of perceiving subtle findings which can lead to a diagnose of a genetic disease in a patient with mental health issues. We also discuss the predisposition to psychiatric disorders in DiGeorge syndrome, Turner syndrome and Fahr syndrome.

Abstract: Intravenous lipid emulsion (ILE) is typically applied as a rescue therapy after the use of conventional treatments for beta blocker (BBs) or calcium channel blocker (CCB) overdoses. We describe the case of a 72-year-old man who presented to our ED after attempting suicide by antihypertensive drug overdose. His blood pressure dropped upon arrival at the ED, and we consequently administered multitherapy including relatively early ILE to prevent prolonged hypotension. He regained stable hemodynamic status on the third day and was later discharged without major sequelae.

Abstract: While there are consensus recommendations for managing calcium channel blocker (CCB) toxicity, reports on angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) toxicity and management are limited. Herein, we report a case of catecholamine-refractory hypotension due to CCB and ARB overdose.
A 54-year-old woman with underlying hypertension was brought to the emergency department after she attempted suicide by ingesting 345 mg of amlodipine, a CCB, and 340 mg of olmesartan, an ARB. She was hypotensive, which was considered vasodilatory because of high cardiac and low systemic vascular resistance indices. Hypotension persisted despite the administration of norepinephrine and epinephrine. Intravenous calcium gluconate, glucagon, and high-dose insulin euglycemia therapy, which were initiated because CCB toxicity was suspected, failed to raise her blood pressure. The presence of normal anion-gap metabolic acidosis and the fact that the patient remained hypotensive suggested that the hypotension might have been due to the effect of ARB. Vasopressin was finally administered, which improved her hemodynamic status. She was weaned off all vasopressors on day 3.
There is no consensus recommendation for ARB toxicity. Since chronic use of ARBs at conventional doses can block the sympathetic nervous and renin-angiotensin systems, catecholamines may not effectively increase blood pressure in cases of hypotension due to ARB overdose, for which vasopressin could be indicated.
Vasopressin could be an option for treating hypotension secondary to ARB and CCB toxicity when catecholamines and treatment for CCB toxicity fail.

Abstract: Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) are a potent class of medications that exert its action by blocking 'L-type' calcium channels. CCB overdose can be fatal even with appropriate and aggressive therapy. Death ensues from heart block, myocardial suppression, vasoplegia, and shock. Early use of methylene blue (MB) might provide additional means to improve outcomes.
A 25-year-old female presented after an attempted suicide. The patient ingested a substantial amount of diltiazem, promethazine, and trazodone. Seven hours following the ingestion, she became profoundly vasoplegic and hypotensive. Despite guideline-based therapy and high doses of vasopressors, she suffered from worsening lactic acidosis and multiorgan failure. Administration of an intravenous bolus dose of MB resulted in a rapid and sustained improvement of vasoplegia, and the patient subsequently went on to make a complete recovery.
In addition to calcium channel blockade, CCBs cause vascular smooth muscle relaxation by the production of nitric oxide (NO). In cases of overdose, NO production can be significant. MB is a safe and inexpensive medication with the potential to reverse NO-mediated vasoplegia that is responsible for CCB induced shock state. In parts of the world where access to advanced medical care is not readily available, early use of MB might have a significant role in the management of CCB overdose.

Abstract: Mutouhapu (610 hap) was a calcium polysulfide colloid preparation, which was sold as a bath salt in Japan. Herein, we report on the autopsy of a suicide case as a result of taking 610 hap orally and present histopathological findings with a focus on corrosive changes observed in upper gastrointestinal tract. The subject was a 60-year-old man who was discovered dead 200-300 m from his home. The site smelled of sulfur. Sixty parts per million hydrogen sulfide was detected in the oral cavity of the deceased. He had schizophrenia since junior high school. At autopsy, the oral and nasal cavities had a rotten-egg smell. Adipose tissues had green coloring. There was thickening and sclerosis of the gastric wall, and a green to pale yellow pseudomembrane-like substance was observed adhering to the gastric mucosa. Gastric content was 400 ml of green to pale yellow sludge. The distal portion of the stomach was highly contracted. Qualitative analysis for hydrogen sulfide was positive. Histological changes in the digestive tract were particularly notable in the stomach. Degeneration and necrosis of the mucosa and submucosa, degeneration of the submucosal fat, and dissection-like changes in the blood vessels of the submucosa were discovered. Basophilic lime granules were found on the mucosal surface. There were hypercontracture changes in the proper muscle layer of the pyloric region. The cause of death was hydrogen sulfide poisoning with associated corrosive gastritis.

Abstract: Overdoses of beta-adrenergic antagonists and calcium channel antagonists represent an uncommonly encountered but highly morbid clinical presentation. Potential therapies include fluids, calcium salts, vasopressors, intravenous lipid emulsion, methylene blue, and high-dose insulin. Although high-dose insulin is commonly used, the kinetics of insulin under these conditions are unknown.
We present a case of a 51-year-old male who sustained a life-threatening overdose after ingesting approximately 40 tablets of a mixture of amlodipine 5 mg and metoprolol tartrate 25 mg. Due to severe bradycardia and hypotension, he was started on high-dose insulin (HDI) therapy; this was augmented with epinephrine. Despite the degree of his initial shock state, he ultimately recovered, and HDI was discontinued. Insulin was infused for a total of approximately 37 hours, most of which was dosed at 10 U/kg/hour; following discontinuation, serial serum insulin levels were drawn and remained at supraphysiologic levels for at least 24 hours and well above reference range for multiple days thereafter.
The kinetics of insulin following discontinuation of high-dose insulin therapy are largely unknown, but supraphysiologic insulin levels persist for some time following therapy; this may allow for simple discontinuation rather than titration of insulin at the end of therapy. Dextrose replacement is frequently needed; although the duration is often difficult to predict, prolonged infusions may not be necessary.

Abstract: Congenital chloride diarrhea (CCD) is a rare inherited disorder of intestinal electrolyte transport that results in a large wastage of electrolytes and water. Advances in substitution therapy using sodium chloride (NaCl) and potassium chloride (KCl) have dramatically improved survival for patients with CCD. Slow-release KCl is widely prescribed as a potassium supplement; however, it has also occasionally been used in suicide attempts, as potassium poisoning can generate life-threatening hyperkalemia.
A 26-year-old female presented to the emergency department (ED) with self-poisoning, having taken 30 tablets of slow-release KCl (total: 240 mmol potassium) following an auditory hallucination. The patient had been undergoing substitution therapy with NaCl and KCl for CCD and been followed up in the pediatric department. One month prior, she developed insomnia and anxiety and had consulted a psychiatrist. At the ED, although her general condition was good, she appeared agitated. Her serum potassium level was 7.0 mmol/L, indicating hyperkalemia, and electrocardiographic changes showed tenting of the T-waves. She responded to the administration of calcium gluconate, sodium bicarbonate, and insulin with glucose, and the serum potassium level improved. Finally, she was diagnosed with schizophrenia.
In CCD management, physicians should pay careful attention to patients' extraintestinal issues, including psychological disorders that may emerge in adulthood.

Abstract: Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) are commonly used but have the potential to cause substantial toxicity. One such underreported toxicity of CCB use is the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
44-year-old previously healthy woman presented to the emergency department (ED) having taken 60 tablets of 125 mg extended-release verapamil and 90 tablets of 0.25 mg clonazepam with the intent to commit suicide. On presentation to the ED, she was sedated and intubated for airway protection. She received aggressive medical resuscitation and was ventilated using low tidal volume mechanical ventilation. The hospital course was complicated by worsening hypoxia and a chest x-ray demonstrating bilateral patchy geographic areas of airspace opacities consistent with ARDS. On day 5 of hospitalization, the patient's clinical status improved significantly, and she was subsequently weaned off vasopressors and extubated.
CCB toxicity can result in profound hypotension, shock, bradycardia, and conduction blocks, as well as hyperglycemia, acidosis and acute kidney injury, and ARDS. It is important for clinicians to understand the signs and symptoms of CCB toxicity, as well as how to treat it.

Abstract: We describe a 27-year-old female with repeated episodes of pulseless electrical activity due to intoxication with a substance that was unidentified at presentation. Severe QRS widening was observed and empiric treatment with sodium bicarbonate and intravenous lipid emulsion was administered. In this case, intraosseous administration of lipid emulsion failed to improve haemodynamic parameters, suggesting that this dose remained in the bone marrow compartment. We recommend that physicians become aware of this possibility and to avoid intraosseous administration of lipid emulsion.

Abstract: This report describes changes in blood and urine concentrations of glyphosate potassium over time and their correlations with clinical symptoms in a patient with acute glyphosate potassium poisoning.
A 67-year-old man visited the emergency center after ingesting 250 mL of a glyphosate potassium-based herbicide 5 h before. He was alert but presented with nausea, vomiting, and bradyarrhythmia with atrial fibrillation (tall T waves). Laboratory findings revealed a serum potassium level of 6.52 mEq/L. After treatment with an injection of calcium gluconate, insulin with glucose, bicarbonate, and an enema with polystyrene sulfonate, the patient's serum potassium level normalized and the bradyarrhythmia converted to a normal sinus rhythm. During admission, the blood and urine concentration of glyphosate and urine aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA, a glyphosate metabolite) was measured at regular time intervals. The patient's glyphosate blood concentration on admission was 11.48 mg/L, and it had decreased rapidly by 16 h and maintained about 1mgl/L by 70 h after admission. Urine glyphosate and AMPA levels had also decreased rapidly by 6 h after admission.
Glyphosate potassium poisoning causes hyperkalemia. Blood concentrations of glyphosate were decreased rapidly by 16 h after admission, and urine concentrations were also decreased by 6 h after admission.

Abstract: Primary brain calcification (PBC), a neurodegenerative disorder with characteristic calcium deposits in the basal ganglia and other brain areas, typically presents with various neurological and psychiatric symptoms in the fourth or fifth decade of life or later. We present the case of a patient with psychiatric manifestations much earlier than usual, in the second decade of life.
The case of an adolescent female with acute psychotic symptoms, emotional instability, disorganized and suicidal behavior, stereotypical movements, below average intelligence and a three-year history of headaches is reported. Among others, the presentation included tactile hallucinations with secondary hypochondriacal delusions, which are rarely described in this diagnosis. Massive calcinations in the area of the basal ganglia and thalamus were determined by computerized tomography. Other causes of brain calcification were excluded. No causative mutations were found in selected genes. All the symptoms apart from lower intellectual abilities improved with quetiapine and sertraline. The patient showed no side effects.
This case report highlights the successful use of quetiapine for symptomatic treatment of acute psychosis due to PBC in an adolescent without exacerbating extrapyramidal symptoms.

Abstract: Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker which is widely used as an antihypertensive drug. Amlodipine overdose have been infrequently reported with occurrence of serious complications and even death in a few cases. We report an interesting case of a young lady who presented with refractory shock with acute kidney injury, which did not respond to therapy despite optimal fluid replacement and vasopressor support. The etiology of shock could not be ascertained and the patient was questioned again to elucidate the missing clue in the history. It was finally revealed that the patient had consumed 900 mg of amlodipine in a suicide bid, for her poor performance in academics. The targeted therapy in the form of IV calcium and hyperinsulinemia-euglycemia therapy (HIET) was started and the patient dramatically improved with shock reversal and improvement in renal function.

Abstract: Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) are a commonly prescribed medication that, at toxic levels, are capable of causing severe refractory hypotension, hypoxic respiratory failure and cardiotoxicity. There is little evidence currently guiding the approach to managing CCB overdose, particularly when combined with other antihypertensive agents.
We describe the use of veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV ECMO) in a previously healthy man following combined overdose with amlodipine and lisinopril in a suicide attempt. ECMO was used to provide oxygenation support, allowing for the amlodipine and lisinopril to be metabolized and cleared while also reducing ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) and avoiding the complications associated with venous-arterial (VA) ECMO, such as differential hypoxemia.
Limited case reports suggesting the use of ECMO in CCB overdose have employed VA ECMO due to CCB-induced cardiotoxicity. We believe that, if cardiac function has been preserved, VV ECMO should be considered a viable treatment strategy for CCB and ACE-I overdose resulting in refractory hypoxemic respiratory failure.

Abstract: Cardiovascular instability associated with calcium channel blocker toxicity comprises a small percentage of overdose presentations, yet they are associated with a high mortality rate. We detail the management of a 64-year-old man who took an intentional overdose of 840 mg nimodipine. We include the treatment he received and highlight the scarcity of evidence behind the use of gastric decontamination, calcium, glucagon, intravenous lipid emulsion, high-dose insulin therapy, sodium bicarbonate, vasopressors and methylene blue in calcium channel blocker toxicity. Additionally, the article explores the use of electrical pacing and venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO). Following successful weaning of VA-ECMO, the patient was successfully extubated but remained neurologically impaired due to hypoxic-ischaemic brain injury, critical care polyneuropathy and renal failure requiring dialysis. He has cerebral performance category 3; he has mild cognitive impairment but able to perform some activities of daily living independently and communicate his thoughts and needs. He requires no respiratory or cardiovascular support.

Abstract: Treatments of patients with amlodipine (a calcium channel blocker, CCB) overdose/poisoning remain challenging and death is certain if not intervened timely. Furthermore, for the society, the availability and common use of this drug can drive more vulnerable groups, especially children, towards an accidental/suicidal poisoning.
Herein, we describe the case of an 18 year-old-adolescent girl who took 150 mg of amlodipine with the suicidal intentions and was admitted in our hospital approximately 4-hours after the ingestion. She developed circulatory failure and tachypnea. Decontamination, calcium, glucagon, and dual vasopressors were started, however, persistent hypotension led to the initiation of hyperinsulinemiceuglycemia therapy. She recovered fully and discharged without any complications in few days. This case educates not only about the successful use of variant drugs in the management of CCB overdose/poisoning, but also calls for the attention of the society for a safe storage of often used drugs, especially away from the children/adolescents.

Abstract: Using calcium salts in management of amlodipine overdose is challenging. A 25-year-old male with known history of adult polycystic kidney disease presented with hypotension, tachycardia, and intact neurological status after ingestion of 450 mg of amlodipine. Immediately, normal saline infusion and norepinephrine were initiated. Two grams of calcium gluconate was injected, followed by intravenous infusion of 1.16 mg/kg/h. The patient was put on insulin-glucose protocol to maintain euglycemia and hyperinsulinemia. Electrocardiography demonstrated junctional rhythm. Serum creatinine was 2.5 mg/dL with metabolic acidosis. By the end of 24 h post-admission, his consciousness, blood pressure, and urine output were normal. Almost 32 h post-admission, he became disoriented and his oxygen saturation decreased and therefore was mechanically ventilated. Second chest X-ray showed pulmonary edema. Serum calcium level increased to 26.1 mg/dL. Calcium was discontinued, and furosemide infusion and calcitonin were intravenously administrated. Urine output increased and hemodialysis improved pulmonary edema and serum calcium level with no change in consciousness. Three days after admission, the patient became anuric and developed multi-organ failure and died 5 days post-admission. To avoid the consequences of excessive infusion of calcium in renal failure patients, the minimum calcium dose with close monitoring is recommended.

Abstract: A 54-year-old female presented after taking an overdose of an unknown amount of hydrochlorothiazide, doxazocin, atenolol and amlodipine. She was initially refractory to treatment with conventional therapy (intravenous fluids, activated charcoal, glucagon 5 mg followed with glucagon drip, calcium gluconate 10%, and atropine). Furthermore, insulin at 4 U/kg was not effective in improving her hemodynamics. Shortly after high dose insulin was achieved with 10 U/kg, there was dramatic improvement in hemodynamics resulting in three of five vasopressors being weaned off in 8 h. She was subsequently off all vasopressors after six additional hours. The role of high dose insulin has been documented in prior cases, however it is generally recommended after other conventional therapies have failed. However, there are other reports that suggest it as initial therapy. Our patient failed conventional therapies and responded well only with maximum dose of insulin. Physicians should consider high dose insulin early in severe beta blocker or calcium channel blocker overdose for improvement in hemodynamics. This leads to early discontinuation of vasopressors. It is important that emergency physicians be aware of the beneficial effects of high dose insulin when initiated early as opposed to waiting for conventional therapy to fail; as these patients often present first to the emergency department. Early initiation in the emergency department can be beneficial in these patients.

Abstract: A liquid chromatographic tandem mass spectrometric method for the identification and quantification of 18 cardiovascular drugs was developed in order to evaluate two cases of fatal intoxication involving diltiazem and amlodipine respectively. Samples were simply diluted and centrifuged using a three-steps procedure with methanol, acetonitrile and mobile phase. The method proved to be selective and all the validation parameters fulfilled the acceptance criteria. In particular, linearity was studied in the range limits of quantitation (LOQ)-1,000 ng/mL (LOQ ranging from 0.8 to 33.3 ng/mL for urine and from 0.7 to 41.3 ng/mL for whole blood). The method was successfully applied to two real cases involving diltiazem and amlodipine fatal intoxications, respectively. Though the subject intoxicated by diltiazem did survive several hours after drug intake, central and peripheral blood levels at autopsy were extremely high (23.4 and 13.4 mg/L, respectively); the cause could be due to the formation of a pharmacobezoar that was found in the duodenum and that could have delayed the drug absorption. Moreover, diltiazem showed postmortem redistribution. On the contrary, the amlodipine peripheral blood level in the second case was relatively low (0.17 mg/L), thus confirming that even the uncontrolled intake of a less toxic calcium channel blocker can lead to death. Furthermore, blood samples were analyzed after 2 years of storage at -20°C: both diltiazem and amlodipine showed a significant degradation (70 and 99%, respectively).

Abstract: Amlodipine predominantly affects vascular smooth muscle cells. Amlodipine overdose usually presents with vasodilatory shock, accompanied by reflex tachycardia rather than bradycardia.An 81-year-old woman presented with impaired consciousness 8 h after ingesting 50 5-mg amlodipine tablets with suicidal intent. On admission, her blood pressure was 50/40 mmHg and her heart rate was 45 b.p.m. Serum amlodipine level was extremely high (474.4 ng/mL), causing refractory bradycardia. She remained hypotensive despite fluid resuscitation, and therefore was administered dopamine and norepinephrine. She was also administered glucagon and calcium gluconate, and underwent high-dose insulin euglycemic therapy.
Although her blood pressure improved, bradycardia progressively worsened and isoproterenol infusion was initiated, which resulted in an improvement in her heart rate. The patient discharged on day 14 without any complications.
Isoproterenol is effective for treating bradycardia after amlodipine overdose.

Abstract: Calcium channel blockers are commonly prescribed medications; calcium channel blocker overdose is becoming increasingly prevalent. The typical presentation of a calcium channel blocker overdose is hypotension and decreased level of consciousness. We describe a case of a calcium channel blocker overdose that led to bilateral cortical blindness, a presentation that has not previously been reported.
A 49-year-old white woman with known bilateral early optic atrophy presented to our hospital with hypotension and obtundation following a known ingestion of 150 mg of amlodipine. She was transferred to our intensive care unit where she was intubated, mechanically ventilated, and required maximal vasopressor support (norepinephrine 40 mcg/minute, epinephrine 40 mcg/minute, and vasopressin 2.4 units/hour) along with intravenously administered crystalloid boluses. Despite these measures, she continued to deteriorate with persistent hypotension and tachycardia, as well as anuria. Intralipid emulsion therapy was subsequently administered to which no initial response was observed. A chest X-ray revealed diffuse pulmonary edema; intravenous diuresis as well as continuous renal replacement therapy was initiated. Following the initiation of continuous renal replacement therapy, her oxygen requirements as well as urine output began to improve, and 3 days later she was liberated from mechanical ventilation. Following extubation, she complained of new onset visual impairment, specifically seeing only red-green colors, but no objects. An ophthalmologic examination revealed that this was due to bilateral optic atrophy from prolonged hypotension during the first 24 hours after the overdose.
Persistent hypotension in the setting of a calcium channel blocker overdose can lead to worsening optic atrophy resulting in bilateral cortical blindness.

Abstract: We report the case of a 25-year-old female presenting to the emergency department after committing suicide by ingesting 100 mg amlodipine. The patient was initially treated with intravenous fluids, calcium gluconate, catecholamines and glucagone without effect. The clinical condition of the patient improved quickly and dramatically on the 20th minute of intravenous lipid emulsion (ILE) therapy. Different treatment methods have been developed for calcium channel blocker intoxication over the last years. Among these, lipid emulsion therapy has risen over the last decade as a salvation in cases which do not respond to other treatments. However, given the paucity of data, there are conflicting recommendations about the indications, dose and timing of ILE in the literature. In the light of this case report, we review the literature and discuss whether ILE therapy can find itself a place among first-line therapy recommendations.

Abstract: Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) are responsible for a substantial portion of the mortality associated with cardiovascular medication overdose cases. Amlodipine, a dihydropyridine CCB, can cause prolonged hypotension in overdose. This report describes a severe amlodipine overdose case that was refractory to multiple therapeutic approaches. A 53-year-old male presented after ingesting eighty 10 mg amlodipine tablets in a suicide attempt. The patient was initially managed with calcium boluses, glucagon, multiple vasoactive agents, lipid emulsion infusions and hyperinsulinemic euglycemic therapy. Methylene blue boluses were initiated when hypotension persisted despite conventional treatments. Refractory hypotension prompted the use of plasmapheresis in an attempt to lower serum amlodipine levels. Finally, the patient was placed on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) to maintain perfusion while the effects of the amlodipine ingestion dissipated. Following an episode of asystole and pulseless electrical activity prior to the start of ECMO, the patient suffered an anoxic brain injury and suspected herniation prompting the family to withdraw medical care. There is limited evidence in the literature describing the refractory treatment modalities utilized in this patient. This report is unique as it describes the clinical course of a patient when a multitude of unique treatments were combined.

Abstract: Yew intoxication has been known for many years; high dose ingestion of Taxus baccata leads to cardiac toxicity mediated by calcium and sodium channel blocking properties. We present a case report of a patient who attempted suicide after T. baccata ingestion, causing refractory cardiogenic shock requiring temporary circulatory assistance by veno-arterial extra corporeal membrane oxygenation (VA ECMO).
A 28-year-old man was admitted to the critical care unit of a university hospital for arrhythmia after ingestion of self-made T. baccata leaf capsules. He rapidly developed cardiovascular collapse requiring mechanical ventilation, high dose intravenous catecholamines and electrical cardioversion. A femoro-femoral VA ECMO was implanted due to severe biventricular dysfunction and ventricular arrhythmia, associated with continuous renal replacement therapy. Taxol A, taxol B and baccatin III were detected and measured in both blood and urine samples by high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, and kinetics suggested urinary excretion. Two days after hospital admission, VA ECMO and continuous renal replacement therapy were removed with full recovery of cardiac function.
Our experience suggests that circulatory assistance by VA ECMO and continuous renal replacement therapy seem to be effective safe second-line therapeutic options in critically ill cases of severe yew intoxication with refractory cardiogenic shock due to arrhythmia.

Abstract: Propafenone is prescribed for the control of cardiac ventricular arrhythmias. Poisoning from propafenone intoxication is rare, but the survival rate of patients is low. We present a case of a 37-year-old man who developed cardiac arrest due to propafenone intoxication. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation, plasmapheresis, and other medical treatments had no effect on cardiac arrest. After repeated administrations of calcium gluconate, the patient achieved a full recovery. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report in which a full recovery from cardiac arrest was achieved by administration of calcium gluconate. We recommend that for patients poisoned by propafenone, close monitoring for decreased blood calcium is important.

Abstract: Diethylene glycol (DEG), an organic compound (HOCH2CH2)2O is a commonly used solvent. Mass poisoning outbreaks have been reported because of frequent contaminations. A PubMed search for diethylene resulted in 795 publications with 151 specifically discussing the toxicity. Of the 151 reported toxicity reviews/case reports, only 6 publications discussed the long-term neurological effects of diethylene toxicity. We report a fatal case of oral ingestion of DEG with complications from delayed toxicity. She died 7 days after the second admission. Autopsy disclosed a right basal ganglia hemorrhage within the brain and microscopic deposits of polarizable crystals into small cerebral blood vessels. Both kidneys illustrate tubular necrosis with scattered tubular deposition of polarizable calcium oxalate crystals. PubMed search leads to only 2 reported cases of basal ganglia hemorrhage (based on radiological findings) after ethylene glycol intoxication. Our case is the first reportable case of basal ganglia hemorrhage after DEG ingestion.

Abstract: We present a case of a 41-year-old woman with medical history significant for urolithiasis presenting to our hospital for psychiatric evaluation due to worsening depression and suicidal ideations for the past 2 weeks. Initial laboratory results show hypercalcaemia of 13.5 mg/mL that led to consulting internal medicine. On further questioning, the patient admitted to cosmetic silicone injections in her buttocks which were causing calcium deposition under her skin, leading to disfigurement of the sacrum and lumbar regions. She underwent further evaluation with CT and laboratory testing, which effectively ruled out malignancy and primary hyperparathyroidism. The hypercalcaemia was diagnosed as non-PTH-dependent with high levels of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D and low PTH. She eventually underwent tissue biopsy confirming the presence of silicone granulomas responsible for the calcitriol-mediated hypercalcaemia. This case reminds one to keep a broad differential especially in patients with hypercalcaemia in which malignancy and primary hyperparathyroidism have been ruled out.

Abstract: Amlodipine, a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, is commonly prescribed for the treatment of hypertension. Ingestion of an overdose leads to severe hypotension; if the hypotension is not treated, death may be imminent. Conventional and unconventional interventions were used to treat an adolescent who ingested a life-threatening dose of amlodipine. Severe hypotension resistant to conventional treatment with intralipids and hyperinsulinemia-euglycemia therapy led to the use of plasmapheresis and a pneumatic antishock garment as lifesaving measures. Plasmapheresis has been described in only one other case of severe amlodipine overdose, and the use of a pneumatic antishock garment has never been described in the management of a calcium channel blocker overdose. Because short-term use of a pneumatic antishock garment has associated risks, the critical care nurse's anticipation of side effects and promotion of safe use of the garment were instrumental in the patient's care and outcome.

Abstract: A 40-year-old male patient with suicidal ingestion of one tablet of aluminium phosphide was referred to the department of toxicology emergency of Baharloo Hospital, Tehran, Iran. The garlic odor was smelled from the patient and abdominal pain and continuous vomiting as well as agitation and heartburn were the first signs and symptoms. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures at the arrival time were 95 and 67 mmHg, respectively. Gastric lavage with potassium permanganate (1:10,000), and 2 vials of sodium bicarbonate through a nasogastric tube was started for the patient and the management was continued with free intravenous infusion of 1 liter of NaCl 0.9% serum plus NaHCO3, hydrocortisone acetate (200 mg), calcium gluconate (1 g) and magnesium sulfate (1 g). Regarding the large intravenous fluid therapy and vasoconstrictor administering (norepinephrine started by 5 µg/min and continued till 15 µg/min), there were no signs of response and the systolic blood pressure was 49 mmHg. At this time, hydroxyethyl starch (HES) (6% hetastarch 600/0.75 in 0.9% sodium chloride) with a dose of 600 cc in 6 hours was started for the patient. At the end of therapy with HES, the patient was stable with systolic and diastolic blood pressure of 110 and 77 mmHg, respectively. He was discharged on the 6th day after the psychological consultation, with normal clinical and paraclinical examinations. This is the first report of using HES in the management of AlP poisoning and its benefit to survive the patient.

Abstract: Intralipid emulsion therapy is well-established for the treatment of local-anesthetic systemic toxicities. In recent years, its role has expanded as an important therapeutic agent in the reversal of other types of drug overdoses, including certain types of antipsychotics, antidepressants, antiarrhythmics, and calcium channel blockers. A literature review identified thirty-one case reports including forty-nine separate drug overdose cases involving ten separate drug classes which were successfully reversed with Intralipid. The present clinical case study describes an elderly unresponsive woman refractory to conventional treatments after ingesting a potentially lethal amount of 5.6 grams of diltiazem in a suicide attempt. After treatment with Intralipid over a twenty-four hour period, the patient's hemodynamic and metabolic derangements were corrected and stabilized completely. Intralipid emulsion rescue therapy provides another potential strategy for the reversal of many drug toxicities, most likely by providing a lipid layer safety net for drug overdose by passive diffusion. Clinicians are urged to embrace an expanded role of Intralipid emulsion rescue therapy, not only for local anesthetic drug toxicities, but also for other lipophilic drug overdoses.

Abstract: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) use in poisoned patients is increasing, but is rare post cardiac arrest. We report a case of ECMO use with complete recovery in a patient who arrested twice after a cardiotoxicant overdose. A 17-year-old male presented after an unknown overdose. He rapidly became hypotensive and bradycardic and received aggressive supportive care without improvement. He was transferred to our institution and suffered a cardiac arrest shortly after arrival. Six minutes of advanced cardiac life support resulted in return of spontaneous circulation. High-dose insulin, lipid emulsion, and ECMO were initiated. While awaiting ECMO deployment, he again became pulseless. Compressions resumed, and after 30 min, ROSC was achieved, and he was cannulated for veno-arterial ECMO. Within 48 h, he was decannulated, and then weaned off epinephrine 2 days later. Upon extubation, he was neurologically intact. Amlodipine and metoprolol were later confirmed in serum. Adolescent poisoned patients represent an ideal population for ECMO due to lack of comorbidities. As experience with ECMO in overdose increases, additional research is needed to determine appropriate indications and timing for its use. ECMO is an option for patients poisoned with a cardiotoxicant drug, even following witnessed cardiac arrest.

Abstract: When anion gap calculation generates a very small or negative number, an explanation must be sought. Sporadic (nonreproducible) measurement errors and systematic (reproducible) laboratory errors must be considered. If an error is ruled out, 2 general possibilities exist. A true anion gap reduction can be generated by either reduced concentrations of unmeasured anions such as albumin or increased concentrations of unmeasured cations such as magnesium, calcium, or lithium. This teaching case describes a patient with aspirin (salicylate) poisoning whose anion gap was markedly reduced (-47 mEq/L). The discussion systematically reviews the possibilities and provides the explanation for this unusual laboratory result.

Abstract: Ambiguous findings during external examination of a deceased in combination with dubious autopsy findings can raise doubts concerning the manner and cause of death. We report the case of a 35-year-old female deceased who had suffered from a borderline personality and depressive disorder with suicidal ideation. At the death scene, the body showed massive facial swelling accompanied by complete reddening of the skin of the face, with patchy skin abrasions on the forehead and neck, and purple bruise-like discolorations distributed symmetrically over both shoulders, elbows, hands, hips, knees, lower legs, and feet, raising the suspicion of underlying massive external blunt force injury. Police investigators strongly suspected sexual homicide. At autopsy, dissection in layers revealed massive subcutaneous hemorrhages as the cause of the reddish skin discolorations. Toxicological analyses showed fatal levels of lamotrigine with additional proof of zopiclone, zolpidem, diphenhydramine, O-desmethylvenlafaxine, pregabalin, tramadol, and modafinil in venous blood. Histologically, both the macroscopically impressive purple skin changes with underlying bleeding into the subcutaneous tissue and the skin abrasions were due to leukocytoclastic vasculitis, a form of acute hypersensitivity vasculitis that was a reaction to the multiple therapeutic drugs that the woman had taken shortly before death. The manner of death was classified as suicide, and sexual homicide was ruled out.

Abstract: Bittern is made from marine water after extraction of salt, and its major components include magnesium chloride, magnesium sulfate, potassium chloride, sodium chloride and magnesium bromide. For a long time, it has been used as the main ingredient of tofu coagulant and chemical weapons. A 73-year-old woman arrived to the emergency department after a suicide attempt by drinking an unknown amount bittern. She complained of dizziness, general weakness, and altered mental state (Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) 13/15). The brain computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed no abnormality. But blood chemistry showed hypermagnesemia ([Mg(2+)] 7.8 mEq/L) and hypernatremia ([Na(+)] 149 mEq/L). Electrocardiograph showed QT prolongation of 0.482 s. Electrolyte imbalances were corrected following adequate fluid therapy and injection of calcium gluconate. The patient recovered/was subsequently discharged without any complications. Electrolyte imbalances are a common presentation following bittern poisoning. Severe side effects like respiratory depression, hypotension, arrhythmia, bradycardia, and cardiac arrest can also occur. Patients will require immediate fluid therapy and correction of electrolyte imbalances. The symptoms vary depending on the electrolyte levels. It is mandatory to closely monitor the electrolyte levels and electrocardiograph in these patients.

Abstract: Ingesting caustic substances represents a common event which may result in serious injuries of the gastrointestinal system. Severity of injury depends on the type of ingested substance: Caustic burns are more frequently associated with acid ingestion and their severity depends on type, concentration, time of exposure, and amount of the ingested substance. We report a case of phosphoric acid ingestion leading to death in a patient with depressive disorder. While reports ingestion of other acids and organophosphates can be found in the literature, there are no reports detailing a death due to phosphoric acid ingestion. We hope that presenting the findings in this case can aid death investigators in future cases that may involve ingestion of such a substance. After autopsy pH, phosphate and calcium ions concentration in the blood were analyzed. The cause of death was due to systemic effects: metabolic acidosis, hypophosphatemia, hypocalcemia, and hyperkalemia.

Abstract: Resuscitation without return to spontaneous circulation in patients with suicidal ingestion of cardiotoxic drugs necessitates alternative bridging therapies for drug removal.
To show the effectiveness of emergency extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and plasmaspheresis in severe polyintoxication.
A 21-year-old woman developed asystole after suicidal polyintoxication with 1.75 g carvedilol, 300 mg amlodipine, 6 g amitriptyline, 500 mg torsemide, 1.5 g ketoprofen, 28 g nicotinic acid, and 16 g gabapentin. After 3 h of cardiopulmonary resuscitation without return to spontaneous circulation, ECMO was used as a bridging therapy and a temporary pacemaker was inserted. Plasma peak levels were measured for amlodipine (29.3 μg/L), amitriptyline (1456 μg/L), carvedilol (585 μg/L), and gabapentin (126.8 mg/L). To facilitate drug removal, therapeutic plasma exchange was performed. The patient could be weaned from ECMO at day 4 and extubated on day 8 after admission without neurologic sequelae.
ECMO and plasma exchange should be considered as a therapeutic option in selected patients under resuscitation without return to spontaneous circulation after severe intoxication.

Abstract: Recently, high-dose insulin (HDI) and intravenous lipid emulsion (ILE) have emerged as treatment options for severe toxicity from calcium-channel blocker (CCB) and beta blocker (BB).
Our aim was to describe the use and effectiveness of HDI and ILE for the treatment of CCB and BB overdose.
We describe 2 patients presenting to the emergency department after intentional ingestions of CCBs and BBs. A 35-year-old man presented in pulseless electrical activity after ingesting amlodopine, verapamil, and metoprolol. A 59-year-old man presented with cardiogenic shock (CS) after ingesting amlodopine, simvastatin, lisinopril, and metformin. Both patients were initially treated with glucagon, calcium, and vasopressors. Shortly after arrival, HDI (1 unit/kg × 1; 1 unit/kg/h infusion) and ILE 20% (1.5 mL/kg × 1; 0.25 mL/kg/min × 60 min) were initiated. This led to hemodynamic improvement and resolution of shock. At the time of hospital discharge, both patients had achieved full neurologic recovery.
HDI effectively reverses CS induced by CCBs and BBs due to its inotropic effects, uptake of glucose into cardiac muscle, and peripheral vasodilatation. ILE is theorized to sequester agents dependent on lipid solubility from the plasma, preventing further toxicity. To our knowledge, these are the first two successful cases reported using the combination of HDI and ILE for reversing CS induced by intentional ingestions of CCBs and BBs.

Abstract: Escitalopram is rarely associated with prolongation of the QTc interval; however, there are no reported cases of QRS complex widening associated with escitalopram overdose. We report a case of a patient who presented with both QRS complex widening and QTc interval prolongation after an escitalopram overdose.
A 16-year-old girl presented to the emergency department after ingestion of escitalopram, tramadol/acetaminophen, and hydrocodone/acetaminophen. Laboratory results were significant for 4-hour acetaminophen 21.1 μg/mL. Serum electrolytes including potassium, magnesium, and calcium were all normal. Initial electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed a widened QRS with an incomplete right bundle branch pattern. After administration of 100-mEq sodium bicarbonate, a repeat ECG revealed narrowing of the QRS complex and a prolonged QTc interval. Magnesium sulfate 2 g intravenous and sodium bicarbonate drip were initiated. A repeat ECG, 1 hour after the second, revealed normalization of the QRS complex and QTc interval.
Prolongation of the QTc interval is an expected effect of escitalopram. Both escitalopram and citalopram are metabolized to the cardiotoxic metabolite S-didesmethylcitalopram and didesmethylcitalopram, respectively, which have been implicated in numerous cardiac abnormalities including widening of the QRS complex. Although never previously described with escitalopram, this mechanism provides a reasonable explanation for the QRS complex widening and incomplete right bundle branch block that occurred in our patient.
Both QRS complex widening and QTc interval prolongation should be monitored in cases of escitalopram and citalopram overdoses.

Abstract: We present a case of diltiazem overdose in which the patient ingested 5.6 g in an apparent suicide attempt. She was admitted in the emergency department 2 hours postingestion with cardiodepressive syndrome. She was treated with gastric lavage, activated charcoal, intravenous fluids, calcium, and epinephrine, without improvement in vital signs. We gave her an infusion of 20% intralipid, leading to a favorable evolution. The patient was stable hemodynamically and metabolic in the following 24 hours. She was alert and oriented and was extubated in the second day. She was discharged after 4 days in a good state and without any neurologic deficits.

Abstract: The object of the current communication is to discuss the theory and the evidence for the use of L-carnitine in calcium channel blocker and metformin poisonings.
A 68-year-old male known for hypertension and type II diabetes was admitted to the critical care unit of a community hospital following an overdose of amlodipine and metformin. The patient was intubated, ventilated, and hemodynamically supported with vasopressors. Despite calcium, glucagon, high-dose insulin (HDI), and lipid emulsion for calcium channel blocker and bicarbonate for metabolic acidosis, the patient remained hemodynamically unstable. The patient was considered too unstable to initiate continuous renal replacement therapy; and without access to extracorporeal life support, the administration of L-carnitine was administered as a last resort. One hour after L-carnitine, the norepinephrine requirements started to decrease, the patient began to improve and was subsequently extubated successfully without apparent sequelae in less than 4 days.
L-Carnitine combined with HDI may have helped with the calcium channel blocker (CCB) poisoning by decreasing insulin resistance, promoting intracellular glucose transport, facilitating the metabolism of free fatty acids, and increasing calcium channel sensitivity. It may have also stimulated oxidative utilization of glucose instead of converting pyruvate into lactate and contributed to decrease lactate production with metformin poisoning.

Abstract: The authors report a case of suicide by hydrogen sulfide in Australia. A young woman was located in a car wearing protective eyewear. A tub of foamy yellow substance and a quantity of hydrochloric acid and lime sulfur were also located in the rear of the vehicle. Morphological findings at autopsy were nonspecific. Toxicologic analysis of a specimen of leg blood detected elevated levels of methemoglobin. If Australia follows a similar trend to Japan and the United States, it is possible that incidences of such cases will rise, probably because of Internet dissemination. From a public health perspective, emergency service providers and forensic case workers should be aware of the potential hazards to themselves and others when dealing with such cases.

Abstract: β-blocker and calcium channel blocker toxicity generally present with bradycardia and hypotension. A 69-year-old woman presented after a suicide attempt with a β-blocker and calcium channel blocker overdose. Her blood pressure was 69/35 mm Hg and her HR was in the 40s. She was treated with calcium chloride, glucagon, a dextrose-insulin infusion and three vasopressors, but remained hypotensive. She suffered two cardiac arrests and required a transvenous pacemaker. When all interventions failed, she was started on a methylene blue infusion for refractory vasodilatory shock which resulted in a dramatic improvement in her blood pressure. The patient was successfully weaned off all vasopressors and from mechanical ventilation without any end-organ damage.

Abstract: Taxine-derived alkaloids, taxane-derived substances, and glycosides seem to be responsible for the toxicity of Taxus spp. by blocking microtubule, sodium and calcium channels causing conduction abnormalities. Cases with Taxus baccata acute intoxication have rarely been reported.
We report the case of a 43-year-old man who ingested, for suicidal purposes, common (or European) yew leaves (Taxus baccata) and presented severe hypokalemia, ventricular arrhythmias with hemodynamic instability accompanied by severe multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, including respiratory insufficiency, renal failure, acid-base imbalance with severe hypokalemia, hepatic dysfunction and coma, which led to death 12 hours after Taxus baccata ingestion.
In this particular case, the cardiac electrical instability was definitely maintained by several causes, including severe hypokalemia, which has not been previously reported as related to Taxus poisoning. The metabolic acidosis associated with severe hypokalemia definitely contributed to the complex arrhythmias. The occurrence of severe hypokalemia needs further attention in cases with Taxus poisoning as its immediate treatment might increase survival chances.

Abstract: We report the case of a patient with calcium channel blocker toxicity who was treated successfully with hyperinsulinemia euglycemia therapy, without prior use of vasopressors. The patient was a 60-year-old man with schizoaffective disorder who presented with severe hemodynamic compromise after an intentional overdose of 5,400 mg of extended-release diltiazem. He had been admitted to the hospital twice before for attempted suicide with diltiazem and nifedipine, respectively. During the previous admissions, conventional treatments were used, and complications included hemodynamic compromise, ischemic bowel requiring ileostomy, and a prolonged hospital stay. During the current admission, the patient's clinical condition failed to improve after treatment with charcoal, fluid resuscitation, calcium, and glucagon. Eight hours after admission, hyperinsulinemia euglycemia therapy was initiated; 3 hours later, the patient's hemodynamic status showed sustained improvement. His bradycardia and hypotension resolved without cardiac pacing or vasopressors. Hyperinsulinemia euglycemia therapy is a potentially life-saving treatment for calcium channel blocker toxicity. We suggest that such therapy should be considered early, in conjunction with conventional therapy, for the treatment of calcium channel blocker overdose in patients not responding to initial treatment.

Abstract: Lime sulfide poisoning by the oral route is rarely encountered in the practice of forensic science, whereas hydrogen sulfide poisoning is seen frequently. We report here two cases of fatal lime sulfide poisoning with several related cases and in addition induced histological damage with acute inflammation in animal models under at similar concentrations. We also evaluated sulfide and thiosulfate concentrations and speculated as to the cause of pancreatic damage in these cases.

Abstract: Pregabalin, or S-(+)-3-isobutylgaba, is a lipophilic analogue of GABA. Although pregabalin is structurally related to GABA, it is inactive at GABA receptors and does not appear to mimic GABA physiologically. Pregabalin is a potent ligand for the alpha-2-delta subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels in the central nervous system. It is currently being licensed for epilepsy, neuropathic pain, and generalized anxiety disorder. There are few case reports that have demonstrated safety of pregabalin in case of intoxication. We report here a case of pregabalin toxicity with a moderate pregabalin concentration that was successfully managed with conservative treatment only. The case report describes a 54-year-old man who was treated with pregabalin for generalized anxiety disorder. After having experienced a significant stress on a job the patient ingested huge amount of pregabalin (4,2 r) together with bromazepam (21 mg) and chlorimipramine (125 mg). On presentation he was conscious and alert with a stable condition of cardiovascular and respiratory systems. The serum pregabalin concentration was 20.8 mg/L but the patient did not have any signs of toxicity. Thanks to his good and stable somatic condition the patient was managed with supportive treatment only. Although anecdotal, our case report points toward safety of pregabalin following deliberate self-poisoning. Our observation is in accordance with the recent international literature underlining that pregabalin was listed as the drug ingested in only 1% of fatalities, usually in combination with other drugs.

Abstract: Fomepizole is the antidote of choice in toxic alcohol poisonings. Potential side effects from frequent use of fomepizole were studied in a patient admitted 154 times with ethylene glycol (EG) poisoning. The intra-individual correlation between the serum-ethylene glycol (serum-EG) and the osmolal gap (OG) EG-kinetics, and other laboratory parameters were also studied.
Combined pro- and retrospective collection of material from three different hospitals, and results from autopsy.
A 26-year-old female with a dissociative disorder was admitted with EG poisoning a total of 154 times. Her admission data revealed a median pH of 7.31 (range 6.87-7.49), pCO(2): 4.2 kPa (1.2-6.7) (32 mmHg [9-50]), HCO-3: 15 mmol/L (4-26) (15 mEq/L [4-26]), base deficit (BD): 10 mmol/L (- 4 to 27) (10 mEq/L [-4 to 27]), serum-creatinine 65 μmol/L (40-133) (0.74 mg/dL [0.45-1.51]), OG 81 mOsm/kgH(2)O (25-132), and serum-EG 44 mmol/L (4-112) (250 mg/dL [25-700]). She was treated with fomepizole 99 times, ethanol 60 times (with a combination of both six times), and dialysis 73 times. The correlation between serum-EG and OG was good (r(2) = 0.76). She was finally found dead outside hospital with an EG blood concentration of 81 mmol/L (506 mg/dL). An autopsy revealed calcium oxalate crystals in the kidneys, slight liver steatosis, and slight edema of the lungs.
The frequent use of fomepizole in this young patient was not associated with any detectable side effects; neither on clinical examination and lab screening, nor on the later autopsy. Regarding the sequelae from the repetitive EG-poisoning episodes, her kidney function seemed to normalize after each overdose. She was treated with buffer and antidote without hemodialysis 81 times without complications, supporting the safety of this approach in selected cases.

Abstract: Lamotrigine is a sodium channel blocking agent that is widely prescribed for treatment of seizure. Although life-threatening effects are rarely observed in overdose, some previous reports have described the occurrence of cardiac toxicity. The management of sodium channel blocking agent-induced cardiotoxicity conventionally requires sodium bicarbonate administration. Recent case reports describe intravenous lipid administration as a successful treatment for refractory cardiovascular collapse induced by sodium channel blocking medications.
The objective of this study is to report the use of intravenous lipid emulsion as adjunctive therapy in a case of lamotrigine overdose in which electrocardiographic changes were unresponsive to bicarbonate therapy.
We report a case of intentional lamotrigine overdose in a 50-year-old woman who lost consciousness and developed electrocardiographic aberrations, including widening of QRS with occurrence of left bundle branch block. The patient was initially treated with sodium bicarbonate without effect. Recovery of cardiac conduction was rapidly achieved after infusion of a 20% lipid emulsion. The exact mechanism of action of lipid emulsion is not fully understood. The lipophilic properties of lamotrigine suggest that it was partially removed by the plasmatic lipid emulsion.
This case provides additional insight into the potential benefit of using lipid emulsion in refractory sodium channel blocking intoxications.

Abstract: Zonisamide is an antiepileptic drug that acts on voltage-sensitive sodium and calcium channels, with a modulatory effect on GABA-mediated neuronal inhibition and an inhibitory effect on carbonic anhydrase. It is used mainly for the treatment of partial seizures, and is generally well tolerated at therapeutic doses. The most common reported adverse effects are somnolence, anorexia, dizziness, and headache. There are limited data on zonisamide overdose in the literature, and no case of zonisamide mono-intoxication has been published to date. We describe the first case of zonisamide mono-intoxication in a 25-year-old woman who ingested 12.6 g of this substance with suicidal intent. Despite a plasma zonisamide concentration of 182 mg/L on admission, the patient exhibited a benign clinical course with vomiting and central nervous system depression, requiring brief intubation. Somnolence persisted for 50 hours, and normal-anion-gap metabolic acidosis and polyuria for several days. Complete recovery may be expected with supportive care, even after ingestion of large zonisamide overdoses.

Abstract: Acute phosphate toxicity following rectal administration of phosphate-containing preparations was documented earlier. However, acute phosphate toxicity due to inhalation of monoammonium phosphate (MAP) is rarely reported. The present report describes the systemic toxicity following intentional inhalation of MAP, a dry chemical powder present in fire extinguishers, in a 25-year-old healthy man with normal renal function resulting in hyperphosphatemia (11.0 mg/dL), hypocalcemia (ionized calcium, 1.18 mg/dL; total calcium, 3.6 mg/dL), hypomagnesemia (1.2 mg/dL), seizures, and 4 episodes of pulseless polymorphic ventricular tachycardia requiring defibrillation. In view of the easy accessibility of fire extinguishers and its likely use for suicidal or homicidal purposes, physicians and practitioners working in emergency departments should be aware of this entity. Early recognition, removal of phosphate by hemodialysis, and supportive care have prevented this case from acute phosphate nephropathy and further complications.

Abstract: Amlodipine poisoning is an uncommon presentation with potentially life threatening complications. As there are few cases of severe poisoning documented, management guidelines are limited. The authors present the case of a 22-year-old female who presented to hospital 6 h after ingesting 280 mg of amlodipine. She was treated with aggressive fluid resuscitation and calcium gluconate infusion. She went on to develop acute non-cardiogenic pulmonary odema for which she needed a frusemide infusion. She stayed in hospital for 5 days and was discharged after a psychiatric review with no long-term complications. The authors discuss the other management options available for patients presenting with amlodipine overdose.

Abstract: Intravenous lipid emulsion (ILE) has been proposed as a rescue therapy for severe local anesthetic drugs toxicity, but experience is limited with other lipophilic drugs. An 18-year-old healthy woman was admitted 8 h after the voluntary ingestion of sustained-release diltiazem (3600 mg), with severe hypotension refractory to fluid therapy, calcium salts, and high-dose norepinephrine (6.66 μg/kg/min). Hyperinsulinemic euglycemia therapy was initiated and shortly after was followed by a protocol of ILE (intralipid 20%, 1.5 ml/kg as bolus, followed by 0.25 ml/kg over 1h). The main finding attributed to ILE was an apparent rapid decrease in insulin resistance, despite a prolonged serum diltiazem elimination half-life. Diltiazem is a lipophilic cardiotoxic drug, which could be sequestered in an expanded plasma lipid phase. The mechanism of action of ILE is not known, including its role in insulin resistance and myocardial metabolism in calcium-channel blocker poisoning.

Abstract: Acute aluminum phosphide (AlP) poisoning is one of the most common causes of acute pesticide poisoning in Iran. Hydrogen phosphide or phosphine gas is produced following reaction of AlP with water even at ambient humidity. Methemoglobinemia is a rare finding following phosphine poisoning. In this paper, two cases of fatal AlP poisoning complicated by methemoglobinemia are reported.
Two patients presented following suicidal ingestion of AlP tablets. In the Emergency Department (ED), they received gastric lavage with sodium bicarbonate and potassium permanganate. Both of them received supportive care. In each case, hematuria and hemolysis were significant events. The patients also showed a decrease in O(2) saturation in spite of high FIO(2). Methemoglobin levels of 40% and 30% were detected by co-oximetry. Neither patient responded to treatment (ascorbic acid in one case, methylene blue in the other). Both patients died due to systemic effects of phosphine poisoning.
Hemolysis and methemoglobinemia may complicate the course of phosphine poisoning that seems resistant to methylene blue and ascorbic acid. Therefore, other treatments including hyperbaric oxygen therapy and exchange blood transfusion should be considered.

Abstract: A 27-year-old woman was initially diagnosed and treated for depression with suicide ideation. Thirteen months later, kidney stones, an elevated parathyroid hormone, and elevated calcium levels led to a diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism. The patient was treated for hyperparathyroidism by resection of the superior right parathyroid gland. When the calcium levels were regulated, the patient's moods, concentration, and memory were back to baseline.

Abstract: We report a patient who developed acute renal failure following the ingestion of a hair-dye with a suicidal intent. He was managed by hemodialysis and other symptomatic measures. He developed generalized seizures and underwent MRI scan of the brain using gadolinium containing contrast material followed by development of bilateral and symmetrical thickening and induration of the skin over the extremities and verrucous papules and plaques over the lower back. Skin biopsy and immunohistochemistry showed typical features of nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy as well as deposits of calcium. Successful management of renal failure resulted in clearing of all skin lesions except a small bony hard plate like area overt the left leg, the biopsy of which showed features of osseous metaplasia.

Abstract: The literature contains many case reports of planned and complex suicides, which combine various methods to commit suicide. In this article, we present the anomalous suicide of an adult male by strangulation with a belt and simultaneous ingestion of plaster. The specific circumstances of the case are described and relevant literature is briefly reviewed. This case vignette illustrates one example of the wide ranging methods employed in suicides and may represent the first reported case of a fatal complex suicide involving self-strangulation and plaster ingestion. Knowledge of varied and sometimes unusual suicide methods is important to the forensic investigator to prevent unnecessary criminal investigation and to reliably and confidently establish manner and cause of death.

Abstract: Hot packs (instant hot compresses) are frequently used to relieve pain. We report a patient who had significant complications from ingestion of a hot pack containing calcium salts. A 35-year-old male swallowed three hot packs, and developed hematemesis, severe abdominal pain, and hypercalcemia (21.1 mg/dl). He developed diffuse gastric necrosis requiring gastrectomy and colonic interposition. Hypercalcemia was treated with intravenous fluids, pamidronate, and calcitonin. A Medline search revealed no prior report on hot pack ingestion though ingestion of calcium salts has been reported. Hot packs can potentially cause significant injury both from an exothermic reaction and hypercalcemia. Ingestions of calcium salts can result in necrosis of the stomach. Management includes aggressive treatment of hypercalcemia, supportive care and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy.

Abstract: Pyrethroids are common household insecticides. Even though they are less toxic to humans, reports of accidental and suicidal poisoning are not uncommon. Cardiotoxicity due to pyrethroid poisoning is rare. We report a case of cardiac conduction disturbance due to a pyrethroid, prallethrin. A 28-year-old female presented after a suicidal consumption of prallethrin. Her clinical and laboratory parameters were normal during the first 24 h of hospital stay. On the second hospital day, she developed metabolic acidosis and sinus arrest with escape junctional rhythm. Despite correction of metabolic acidosis, the sinus arrest persisted for 3 days. She reverted back to sinus rhythm with bradycardia after this period and was discharged on the seventh hospital day. Her follow-up was uneventful. Pyrethroid poisoning can affect the gastrointestinal, respiratory, and nervous system. Most serious effects of the toxin in humans are seizures and coma. Mechanism of pyrethroid neurotoxicity is believed to be due to its ability to modify sodium, chloride, and calcium channels of the neurons. Our case raises the possibility that cardiac arrhythmia due to pyrethroid poisoning can occur due to its effect on sodium channels in the heart.

Abstract: We report an autopsy case of a man who died 2 days after taking an overdose of vegetamin. The autopsy findings were as follows: the epidermis on the axillary fossa and the inguinal skin had become macerated. Skeletal muscle was discolored. Concentrations of urea nitrogen, creatinine and urine myoglobin were 1.95 g/day, 0.66 g/day and 1100 ng/mL, respectively. Immunohistochemically, myoglobin was strongly stained at the Bowman's capsule, and tubular lumen and epithelium. 8-OH-dG was strongly stained in renal tubular epithelium in which cell nuclei were strongly stained. ORP-150 was observed in intraglomerular cells and renal tubular epithelium. The concentrations of phenobarbital, promethazine and chlorpromazine ranged from therapeutic to toxic levels, from toxic to lethal levels and toxic level, respectively. His cause of death was considered to be vegetamin-induced rhabdomyolysis. In genetic analysis of this subject, there were two heterozygous silent mutations in the three hot-spot regions in the RYR1 gene. In the CPT II gene, the subject was found to be heterozygous for an amino acid substitution in exon 4, (1203)G>A causing a (368)Val>Ile amino acid substitution. There was no mutation in the VLCAD gene or CYP2C19 gene. The subject was heterozygous for CYP2D6*1 and CYP2D6*2.

Abstract: Acute renal failure can result from a wide variety of causes. When the cause of acute renal failure is unclear, the history, physical examination, and laboratory findings are crucial to help establish the cause. However, the cause of acute renal failure may remain unclear even after gathering this information. In this report, we describe a case of acute chronic renal failure in which the cause of acute renal failure was not determined until a kidney biopsy was performed, which revealed calcium oxalate crystals in the renal parenchyma, a finding pathognomonic for ethylene glycol ingestion.

Abstract: We report an autopsy case of a man in his forties who died 2 days after taking an overdose of vegetamin. The autopsy findings were as follows: externally, the upper epidermis of some parts of the body had become loosened. The epidermis was easily detached from the dermis using the fingers. Viscous fluid adhered around the nose and mouth. The brain was edematous and weighed 1520 g. Skeletal muscle was discolored. The urine was a slightly red-tinged yellow. The organs showed congestion. Urine tests: urea nitrogen: 1.95 g/day; creatinine: 0.66 g/day; urine myoglobin: 1100 ng/mL. Blood level of drugs: phenobarbital: 38.2 microg/ml; promethazine: 2.22 microg/ml; chlorpromazine: 0.96 microg/ml. Immunohistochemistry identified myoglobin in the kidney. From these findings, his cause of death was considered to be vegetamin-induced neuroleptic malignant syndrome and rhabdomyolysis. Mutation of the ryanodine receptor 1 gene is associated with malignant hyperthermia. However, there was no mutation which causes amino acid substitution in the three hot-spot regions of the ryanodine receptor 1 gene. Partial deficiency of carnitine palmitoyltransferase II is the commonest cause of recurrent rhabdomyolysis in adults. The subject was found to be heterozygous for an amino acid exchange in exon 4, (1203)G-->A causing a (368)Val-->Ile amino acid substitution. It is necessary to examine other candidate gene mutations.

Abstract: Three alcoholics (62 years, 47 years, 83 years) died between 11 and 18 h after ingestion of ethylene glycol (EG). One person committed suicide. Observed symptoms of intoxication were seizures, respiratory depression, arrhythmias and hypotonia. All died in hospital after failed attempts at resuscitation, one person did so after an 11h dialysis treatment. EG was detected in blood in concentrations of between 1 and 3mg/L (toxic range: >0.3mg/L). One case presented a blood alcohol concentration (bac) of 1.14 per thousand. Further toxic substances were not found. Using special staining techniques, oxalate crystals were found in samples from the kidneys, explaining renal failure, and in the medial layer of cerebral vessels.

Abstract: We present a case report of intoxication by a potentially lethal dose of sustained-release verapamil with delayed escalation of complications. The patient was hospitalized 1.5 h after an attempted suicide with a very high dose of verapamil sustained-release (7.2 g). On admission the plasma concentrations were extremely high (3600 ng/l). Heart rate and blood pressure declined slowly with a surprising sudden escalation on the third day coupled with hemodynamic collapse and loss of consciousness. Complete recovery was achieved in spite of 2 h of extreme hypotension. We outline the clinical course, a need for massive bowel irrigation in case of sustained-release medication, the timing of a temporary pacing and the effect of centralization of circulation even on invasively measured blood pressure.

Abstract: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants are preferred to tricyclics, because, for the same efficacy, they are better tolerated. The mechanisms of action are well understood. These drugs may be used during pregnancy. We present here the case of a voluntary intoxication with SSRI in the third trimester of pregnancy.

Abstract: Excessive ingestion of magnesium may lead to hypermagnesemia even without kidney dysfunction. Several cases of development of hypermagnesemia after overdose of magnesium hydroxide have been reported. Although magnesium hydroxide is widely used as laxative, its overdose may induce diarrhea, which is followed by excessive magnesium loss. I report a case of paradoxical hypomagnesemia developed after excessive ingestion of magnesium hydroxide. A 39-year-old woman was presented to the emergency department complaining of severe watery diarrhea and carpopedal spasm after ingesting a handful of magnesium hydroxide tablets. The laboratory tests detected hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, and normokalemia. Calcium gluconate was given to the patient, but her symptom did not improve shortly. The symptom disappeared spontaneously 2 days after the watery diarrhea subsided. This case shows that overdose of magnesium hydroxide, which leads to massive diarrhea, might induce hypomagnesemia unexpectedly. This case also suggests that it should be treated, as well as typical magnesium deficiency.

Abstract: Treatment of otherwise lethal ethylene glycol poisoning depends on rapid diagnosis, aggressive supportive care, appropriate use of alcohol dehydrogenase inhibitors and, in selected patients, hemodialysis. Next to that, specific measures to prevent renal or systemic calcium-oxalate deposition are important. We report the case of a 12-year-old girl who ingested more than five times the lethal dosis of ethylene glycol in a suicide attempt. At admission her serum ethylene glycol concentration was 88 mg/dl. Under treatment by ethanol infusions to block the alcohol dehydrogenase and by hemodialysis to eliminate ethylene glycol and its toxic metabolites, this level decreased to below 15 mg/dl within 36 h. The plasma oxalate level, however, rose to a maximum of 89 micromol/l (normal <6.3 +/- 1.1) on day 3 and only normalized on day 7 after ingestion. In addition, urinary oxalate excretion was elevated (maximum 1.16 mmol/1.73 m(2)/24 h). Both lead to calcium-oxalate oversaturation and hence to the risk of local (renal) or systemic crystal deposition. Therefore, alkaline citrate was given as a preventive measure to increase urinary oxalate solubility, but nephrocalcinosis still developed. Metabolic acidosis, hypocalcaemia, and neurological symptoms had not occurred. Four weeks after discharge, both plasma and urinary oxalate levels were normal.

Abstract: Sustained-release calcium channel blocker (CCB SR) overdoses are potentially life-threatening ingestions. These patients may not become hemodynamically unstable until many hours after ingestion. On theoretical grounds, some have suggested that whole bowel irrigation (WBI) with polyethylene glycol electrolyte lavage solution may be of value in the management of these cases. We report two cases with poor outcome (including one fatality) that were complicated by the use of WBI. Both cases were treated with WBI beginning before and continuing after developing hypotension. WBI should be avoided in the setting of the hemodynamically unstable CCB SR overdose.

Abstract: Compared to other calcium channel blockers (CCBs), overdose with dihydropyridine CCBs are considered relatively benign due to their vascular selectivity. Although not a sustained-release preparation, amlodipine's prolonged duration of effect is concerning following overdose. In addition, angiotensin II receptor blocker blunting of vasoconstrictive and sympathetic compensatory responses could exacerbate calcium channel blocker toxicity. We describe severe toxicity associated with an overdose of amlodipine and valsartan.
A 75-year-old woman presented to the ED 45 minutes after a witnessed suicidal ingestion of a "handful" of amlodipine and valsartan tablets. Hypotension, which appeared two hours after ingestion, was refractory to crystalloids and colloids, calcium gluconate, epinephrine, norepinephrine, phenylephrine, and vasopressin infusions. High-dose insulin euglycemia (HIE) therapy, and treatment with glucagon and naloxone were successful in improving her hemodynamic status. In this combined overdose, right heart catheterization demonstrated both negative inotropic effects and decreased systemic vascular resistance.
Co-ingestion of amlodipine with valsartan produced profound toxicity. Early institution of HIE therapy may be beneficial to reverse these effects.

Abstract: Cardiovascular medications are ubiquitous and are frequently implicated in accidental or intentional overdose. It is common that combined use of these drugs may lead to hypotension and even shock, followed by metabolic derangements. We report a case in which an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) was used in the management of self-poisoning with verapamil, amlodipine, metoprolol, and ibuprofen. In presenting this case of combined massive drug ingestion, we outline early strategy in the Emergency Department and some alternative treatment options. Beyond pharmacological and conservative procedures, we implemented an invasive approach that included temporary pacing, mechanical ventilation, and intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation (IABP). Such intense treatment was necessary due to the critical state of the patient. In our opinion, the use of the IABP contributed to the final recovery of our adolescent patient. Combined mechanical and pharmacological treatment may protect from multi-organ insufficiency, including permanent central nervous system injury. It is hoped that reporting our experience will raise awareness of alternative treatment options for ingestions of cardiovascular medications.

Abstract: Therapeutic plasma exchange is a procedure used to remove pathologic substances from a patient's blood that has proven useful in some cases of drug overdose. Overdose by calcium channel blocker antihypertensive agents has been shown to be a cause of significant morbidity and can often times prove fatal. These agents cause systemic hypotension by inhibiting cell membrane calcium channels, which leads to a slowing of intracardiac electric conduction with consequent impairment of myocardial function and widespread vasodilation. Shock and metabolic acidosis result from the persistent hypotension. In high doses, calcium channel blocking agents cause insulin resistance. We describe the case of a previously healthy young woman who ingested a massive dose of amlodipine and was treated by therapeutic plasma exchange after non-responsiveness to conventional therapy. The case illustrates the need for utilization of therapeutic plasma exchange in the emergency management of certain cases of severe amlodipine overdose.

Abstract: Combined poisoning with calcium-channel blockers and beta-blockers is usually associated with severe heart failure. This report shows the effectiveness of emergency extracorporeal life support in treating life-threatening simultaneous propranolol and verapamil intoxication. A 15-year-old girl presented in cardiogenic shock after alcohol consumption and a propranolol and verapamil overdose; plasma concentrations: propranolol, 0.53 m/mL; verapamil, 1.06 mg/mL. She was successfully resuscitated with extracorporeal life support. Therapeutic plasma exchange was initiated. Extracorporeal support was discontinued 70 hours later. The patient made a full recovery. Simultaneous verapamil and propranolol overdoses can cause severe hemodynamic compromise and arrest of electrical and mechanical function of the heart. Emergency extracorporeal life support can successfully maintain vital organ blood flow and allows time for drug metabolism, redistribution, and removal. Therapeutic plasma exchange may reduce the time of emergency extracorporeal life support. Emergency extracorporeal life support should be considered early in cases of near-fatal intoxications with cardiodepressive drugs.

Abstract: Bezoars usually present as a mass in the stomach. One of the uncommon causes of bezoars is ingestion of plaster in a suicidal attempt. We present here two patients with acute formed gastric bezoars due to plaster ingestion. Their main complaints were abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Clinical examination revealed a slightly distended abdomen and a palpable mass in the epigastric region. Plain abdominal radiograph showed plaster casts in the stomach. They were successfully treated by insertion of a nasogastric tube and gastric irrigation using saline solution over 24 h. Post-treatment abdominal X-ray showed dissolved plaster passing through the small intestines and the colon. The treatment course was uneventful, and finally patients were discharged with good condition and referred to a psychiatric clinic for treatment of underlying psychological disorder.

Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to report a case of fluoride poisoning along with a discussion of poisoning characteristics, analytical procedures, and a review of previous reports of fatal intoxications with analytical data. A case of suicidal ingestion of 40 mL of a rust removal agent containing hydrofluoric acid and ammonium fluoride by a 33-year-old white male is presented. He had an organic personality disorder with residual schizophrenia and previous suicide attempts with therapeutic drugs and cleaning products. At admission, he presented with a Glasgow coma score of 3, third degree atrioventricular block, and asystole. Resuscitation efforts were performed during which the patient suffered two episodes of ventricular fibrillation followed by asystole. In spite of advanced resuscitation efforts and the administration of calcium chloride, he died 2.5 h after the ingestion. Analytical data in the hospital showed calcium levels of 3.1 mg/dL and metabolic acidosis. Internal findings were erosive gastritis, brain edema, and pulmonary and hepatic congestion. Quantitation of fluoride was performed using an ion-selective electrode for the anion. Disposition of fluoride in the different tissues was as follows: peripheral blood, 19.4 mg/L; urine, 670 mg/L; vitreous humor, 2.5 mg/L; liver, 40.0 mg/kg; kidney, 60.0 mg/kg; lung, 17.5 mg/kg; brain, 2.5 mg/kg; spleen, 30.0 mg/kg; bone, 0.5 mg/ kg; and gastric content, 1120 mg/L (67 mg total). Validation of the analytical method was performed using different spiked tissues, in a range of concentrations from 2.4 to 475 mg/L or mg/kg, and submitting them to dilution (1:25) to avoid the matrix effect and to bring these concentrations to the range of the aqueous calibration curve (0.19-19 mg/L). Limits of detection and quantitation were 0.02 and 0.1 mg/L, respectively. The linearity of the method, for all studies tissues, was excellent, with r(2) values of 0.999. Accuracy and precision were within 10.5% and 5.7%, respectively. Fluoride analyses using the ion selective electrode are simple, sensitive, and rapid. This report provides an extensive tissue distribution study of fluoride after a well documented case of acute poisoning. Based on the autopsy findings, patient history, toxicology results, and previously reported data the forensic pathologists ruled that the cause of death was due to a fluoride poisoning, and the manner of death was listed as suicide.

Abstract: Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder characterized by midlife onset, progressive course and a combination of motor, cognitive and psychiatric symptoms. Since dysregulation of the glutamate/calcium signalling pathway is beginning to emerge as a potential cause of neuron degeneration, antagonists of glutamate pathways such as lamotrigine, may have beneficial value for treatment of HD. We describe the use of lamotrigine in the treatment of an HD patient with motor abnormality (choreoathetoidic movements) complicated by psychiatric abnormalities (depression, severe mood swing and recurrent high risk of suicidal attempts). The patient's depression, severe mood swing and choreoathetoidic movements significantly improved with 300 mg/day of lamotrigine. Experience from our patient suggests that lamotrigine might be effective in treating HD patients with motor and mood symptoms. Further controlled studies are warranted to confirm its efficacy in patients of this type.

Abstract: Animal studies show efficacy of intravenous lipid emulsion in the treatment of severe cardiotoxicity associated with local anesthetics, clomipramine, and verapamil, possibly by trapping such lipophilic drugs in an expanded plasma lipid compartment ("lipid sink"). Recent case reports describe lipid infusion for the successful treatment of refractory cardiac arrest caused by parenteral administration of local anesthetics, but clinical evidence has been lacking for lipid's antidotal efficacy on toxicity caused by ingested medications. A 17-year-old girl developed seizure activity and cardiovascular collapse after intentional ingestion of up to 7.95 g of bupropion and 4 g of lamotrigine. Standard cardiopulmonary resuscitation for 70 minutes was unsuccessful in restoring sustained circulation. A 100-mL intravenous bolus of 20% lipid emulsion was then administered, and after 1 minute an effective sustained pulse was observed. The patient subsequently manifested significant acute lung injury but had rapid improvement in cardiovascular status and recovered, with near-normal neurologic function. Serum bupropion levels before and after lipid infusion paralleled triglyceride levels. This patient developed cardiovascular collapse because of intentional, oral overdose of bupropion and lamotrigine that was initially refractory to standard resuscitation measures. An infusion of lipid emulsion was followed rapidly by restoration of effective circulation. Toxicologic studies are consistent with the lipid sink theory of antidotal efficacy.

Abstract: A case of severe amlodipine overdose with only mild symptoms is described. Plasma concentrations of amlodipine were measured in serial samples by gas chromatography. There was no concomitant overdose. The present case is compared with previous reported cases of amlodipine overdose where patients all developed severe symptoms. We conclude that amlodipine overdose does not always cause severe symptoms.

Abstract: We report the case of attempted suicide with amlodipine, chlorthalidone and mefenamic acid and subsequent medical intensive care measures which resulted in total recovery of a 42-year-old male. After admission to the medical intensive care unit the intoxicated patient was deeply hypotensive and needed fluid replacement, dobutamine and norepinephrine. Additionally insulin and calcium gluconate were given. Since hypotension persisted and the patient developed oliguria, terlipressin was applied and finally showed an effect on blood pressure and on urinary output. A volume overload of 7 L in the first 24 h resulted in a pulmonary edema. The patient was started on non-invasive ventilation with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and frusemide was added to the therapy with good success. Quantitative determination of amlodipine in plasma samples was performed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The highest amlodipine concentrations was measured in the plasma sample collected approximately 8 h after ingestion of the drug, and was 393 microg/L. Four days later, it was possible to stop the treatment with catecholamines, at that time the amlodipine plasma concentration had declined to 132 microg/L, still tenfold higher than therapeutic (5-18 microg/L). Elimination half-life of amlodipine is approximately 55 h. After 6 days in the intensive care unit the patient was transferred to psychiatric treatment. Intensive care management and plasma levels in this intoxication case are compared to data from literature on other cases.

Abstract: Two fatal overdoses of the calcium channel blocker amlodipine are described. Postmortem samples were screened for volatiles and therapeutic and abused drugs. Amlodipine was measured by liquid chromatography-atmospheric pressure photoionization-mass spectrometry. The heart blood amlodipine concentrations for the two cases were 2.4 and 0.95 mg/L, and amlodipine was quantified in all other tissues. In the first case, venlafaxine and norvenlafaxine were also found, and the angiotensin receptor antagonist olmesartan was tentatively identified. The concentrations of amlodipine are compared with previously reported fatal and nonfatal overdoses. The medical examiners ruled in both cases that the manner of death was suicide and the causes of death were mixed drug intoxication and amlodipine intoxication.

Abstract: Major depression is a mood disorder characterized by a sense of inadequacy, despondency, decreased activity, pessimism, anhedonia and sadness where these symptoms severely disrupt and adversely affect the person's life, sometimes to such an extent that suicide is attempted or results. Antidepressant drugs are not always effective and some have been accused of causing an increased number of suicides particularly in young people. Magnesium deficiency is well known to produce neuropathologies. Only 16% of the magnesium found in whole wheat remains in refined flour, and magnesium has been removed from most drinking water supplies, setting a stage for human magnesium deficiency. Magnesium ions regulate calcium ion flow in neuronal calcium channels, helping to regulate neuronal nitric oxide production. In magnesium deficiency, neuronal requirements for magnesium may not be met, causing neuronal damage which could manifest as depression. Magnesium treatment is hypothesized to be effective in treating major depression resulting from intraneuronal magnesium deficits. These magnesium ion neuronal deficits may be induced by stress hormones, excessive dietary calcium as well as dietary deficiencies of magnesium. Case histories are presented showing rapid recovery (less than 7 days) from major depression using 125-300 mg of magnesium (as glycinate and taurinate) with each meal and at bedtime. Magnesium was found usually effective for treatment of depression in general use. Related and accompanying mental illnesses in these case histories including traumatic brain injury, headache, suicidal ideation, anxiety, irritability, insomnia, postpartum depression, cocaine, alcohol and tobacco abuse, hypersensitivity to calcium, short-term memory loss and IQ loss were also benefited. Dietary deficiencies of magnesium, coupled with excess calcium and stress may cause many cases of other related symptoms including agitation, anxiety, irritability, confusion, asthenia, sleeplessness, headache, delirium, hallucinations and hyperexcitability, with each of these having been previously documented. The possibility that magnesium deficiency is the cause of most major depression and related mental health problems including IQ loss and addiction is enormously important to public health and is recommended for immediate further study. Fortifying refined grain and drinking water with biologically available magnesium to pre-twentieth century levels is recommended.

Abstract: Plaster ingestion forming gastric bezoar is a strange way to attempt suicide and this method has not yet been reported. It may lead to a mechanical obstruction of the gut, especially the pyloric region, and could manifest with abdominal pain, epigastric distress, nausea, vomiting, and fullness.
Herein we report a case of a 37 year-old woman presenting with plaster ingestion and gastric outlet obstruction, who underwent surgery. At six months follow-up the patient was fully recovered.
Plaster has no toxic or erosive effects. Endoscopic or surgical removing of such material is recommended. Moreover, psychiatric intervention and management is imperative to prevent recurrence in such cases.

Abstract: Ethylene glycol (EG) can be found in many agents, such as antifreeze. Ingestion of EG may cause serious poisoning. Adults are typically exposed when EG is ingested as a cheap substitute for ethanol or in suicide-attempts. Children may be exposed by accidental ingestion caused by decantation of EG to unlabeled bottles. EG has in itself a low toxicity, but is in vivo broken down to four organic acids: glycoaldehyde, glycolic acid, glyoxylic acid and oxalic acid. The metabolites are cell toxins that cause central nervous system depression, and cardio-pulmonary and renal failure. Glycolic acid causes severe acidosis, and oxalate is precipitated as calcium oxalate in the kidneys and other tissues. We present five case reports of fatal EG-poisoning, and review the literature concerning clinical presentation and diagnosis, pathological findings, treatment and prevention.

Abstract: In acute poisoning with beta-blocking drugs and calcium-channel blockers patients may present with serious symptoms. We present a case of life-threatening sotalol and verapamil intoxication in a 29-year-old female suffering from depression. She was admitted to our hospital a few hours after she had taken 3.6 g verapamil and 4.8 g sotalol. On being found the patient was breathing and had a palpable pulse. On admission the patient experienced a cardiovascular collapse and CPR was started. Echocardiography confirmed cardiac standstill. After 4 h of normothermic CPR, extra corporeal heart lung assist (ECHLA) was established. Vasoactive drugs could be stopped after 2 days with ECHLA, and after 5 days the patient was extubated. The patient experienced several complications (intestinal bleeding, transient nerve paralysis, and renal failure due to rhabdomyolysis) but made a complete recovery and started working 6 months after the poisoning. She was no longer depressed.

Abstract: To report a patient with a significant amlodipine self-poisoning who failed to clinically respond to conventional treatment and was managed with metaraminol (Aramine).
A 43-year old male presenting after ingestion of 560 mg amlodipine, who failed to respond clinically to treatment with fluid resuscitation, calcium salts, glucagon and norepinephrine/epinephrine inotropic support.
Following a loading bolus of 2 mg and intravenous infusion (83 microg/min) of metaraminol (Aramine) there was improvement in his blood pressure, cardiac output and urine output.
This is the first case report of the beneficial use of metaraminol (aramine) in the management of significant amlodipine poisoning unresponsive to conventional therapy.

Abstract: Aluminium phosphide is used to control rodents and pests in grain storage facilities. It produces phosphine gas, which is a mitochondrial poison. Unfortunately, there is no known antidote for aluminium phosphide intoxication, but our recent experience with a case showed that rapid prevention of absorption by coconut oil might be helpful. In the present case, we used the same protocol in a 28-year-old man who had ingested a lethal amount (12 g) of aluminium phosphide with suicidal intent and was admitted to hospital approximately 6 hours postingestion. The patient had signs and symptoms of severe toxicity, and his clinical course included metabolic acidosis and liver dysfunction. Treatment consisted of gastric lavage with potassium permanganate solution, oral administration of charcoal and sorbitol suspension, intravenous administration of sodium bicarbonate, magnesium sulphate and calcium gluconate, and oral administration of sodium bicarbonate and coconut oil. Conservative and supportive therapy in the Intensive Care Unit was also provided. The patient survived following rapid treatment and supportive care. It is concluded that coconut oil has a positive clinical significance and can be added to the treatment protocol of acute aluminium phosphide poisoning in humans.

Abstract: A fatality involving verapamil, a calcium channel blocker agent, is presented. A 51-year old male ingested 7200 mg of sustained-release (SR) verapamil at T0 and died 40 hours later of refractory, mixed shock and multiorgan failure. The symptoms displayed during hospitalization were quite typical and involved altered consciousness, hypotension, bradycardia, atrioventricular block, metabolic acidosis and renal failure. Verapamil and its primary metabolite, norverapamil, were assayed on eight plasma and two urine samples, successively taken between the admission to the ICU (T0 + 4 hours) and time of death, using an original high-performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (HPLC/MS) procedure with verapamil-d3 as internal standard. Plasma verapamil and norverapamil levels on admission were 0.94 and 1.36 microg/mL, respectively, then verapamil remained practically unchanged throughout the hospitalization (0.85 microg/mL at T0 + 40 hours). The discussion focuses on the detrimental role of SR formulations in overdose, with special emphasis on the risk of pharma-cobezoar development already reported with SR-verapamil. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a verapamil fatality documented by repeated plasma measurements of the drug during the antemortem period.

Abstract: We report a case of severe hypokalemia and flaccid muscle paralysis following a suicide attempt associating the calcium channel blocker amlodipine, the antidepressant fluoxetine and barium carbonate. Despite rapid correction of severe, life-threatening hypokalemia, areflexic quadriplegia persisted, suggesting a direct effect of barium on muscle cells. Continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) was initiated. We determined barium concentration in the urine, plasma, and hemodiafiltrate during CVVHDF. We subsequently calculated the amounts of barium eliminated both by the CVVHDF and the kidneys. CVVHDF triples the measured barium elimination, reduced serum barium half-life by a factor of three, stabilized serum potassium levels, and rapidly improved motor strength, with complete neurological recovery within 24 h. Presentation and treatment of barium intoxication are discussed.

Abstract: The therapeutic efficacy and safety of beta-adrenoreceptor-blocking drugs has been well established in patients with angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmias, and hypertension and reducing the risk of mortality and nonfatal reinfarction on survival of acute myocardial infarction. The calcium antagonists are used for the treatment of patients with angina pectoris, long-term systemic hypertension, and the management of hypertensive emergencies and also for a multitude of other cardiovascular and noncardiovascular conditions. Because adverse cardiovascular effects can occur, however, patients being considered for combination treatment with propranolol and diltiazem must be selected carefully and observed closely. In this article, we present a suicidal case of drug overdose with propranolol and diltiazem with unusual electrocardiographic changes.

Abstract: We present here a fatal poisoning case involving verapamil, metoprolol and digoxin. A 39-year-old male was found dead in his room, and a lot of empty packets of prescribed drugs were found near the corpse. The blood concentrations of verapamil, metoprolol and digoxin were 9.2 microg/ml, 3.6 microg/ml and 3.2 ng/ml, respectively. The cause of death was given as cardiac failure, hypotension and bradycardia due to a mixed drug overdose of verapamil, metoprolol and digoxin, based on the results of the autopsy and toxicological examination. We speculate that the toxicity of verapamil is potentiated by drug interaction with metoprolol and digoxin.

Abstract: A 60-year-old man presented to an emergency department 2 h after the ingestion of 8 g of diltiazem (about 40 slow-release capsules, 200 mg/each) in a suicide attempt. The subject was treated with a gastric lavage and activated charcoal; then, a temporary transvenous pacing was also inserted. Despite emergency pharmacological treatment, the subject died about 20 h after ingestion. Postmortem diltiazem and desacetyl-diltiazem concentrations, measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, were as follows: 31.1 mg/mL diltiazem and 9.7 mg/mL desacetyl-diltiazem in blood; 33.1 mg/g diltiazem and 13.7 mg/g desacetyl-diltiazem in brain; 179.5 mg/g diltiazem and 47.5 mg/g desacetyl-diltiazem in lung; 41.8 mg/g diltiazem and 10.1 mg/g desacetyl-diltiazem in heart; 182.1 mg/g diltiazem and 47.3 mg/g desacetyl-diltiazem in liver; 49.2 mg/g diltiazem and 22.6 mg/g desacetyl-diltiazem in kidney; and 294.9 mg/mL diltiazem and 29.4 mg/mL desacetyl-diltiazem in bile. It is interesting to note that although several cases of acute diltiazem poisoning have been reported in literature, only a few were lethal. Diltiazem concentrations found in our case are notably higher than those reported in other studies, including those in which diltiazem ingestion resulted in the death of the patient. Notably, in many of these latter cases, the doses of diltiazem ingested were higher than those taken by our patient.

Abstract: A 45-y-o male with a history of schizophrenia was admitted to a local VA psychiatric unit. Five days later, endoscopy due to abdominal pain, gastrointestinal bleeding and blood hemoglobin of 5.6 g/dL revealed bullets in the stomach. On subsequent radiograph, > 50 bullets were visualized in the stomach and intestines. Poison Center recommendations included whole bowel irrigation and a blood lead level. After poor results with gastrointestinal decontamination and a repeat radiograph showing > 100 cartridges, surgical intervention was considered but not performed due to perceived risk of bullet detonation from electrocautery. The blood lead was reported as 391 mcg/dL. Calcium EDTA therapy was initiated, followed by aggressive gastrointestinal decontamination. Four days of whole bowel irrigation facilitated passage of 206 cartridges over the next 10 days. The patient was discharged on a 14-day course of 600 mg Succimer tid to treat the bone lead deposits and blood lead level of 49 mcg/dl. An outpatient visit 6 w later showed the blood lead level had dropped to 24 mcg/dl. Aggressive gastrointestinal decontamination and calcium EDTA and Succimer administration successfully treated an ingestion lead bullets and the resulting lead poisoning.

Abstract: Atrioventricular (AV) dissociation is an electrocardiographic syndrome; a descriptive term for a variety of conditions of abnormal cardiac conduction which all feature independent function of the atria and ventricles. AV dissociation can be subclassified as AV dissociation by default (an independent ventricular pacemaker responds to slowing of the dominant atrial pacemaker) versus AV dissociation by usurpation (acceleration of a latent pacemaker takes control of cardiac conduction by exceeding the intrinsic atrial rate). Inclusion of third degree AV block (complete heart block) as a manifestation of AV dissociation is controversial, yet is functionally appealing in that this disorder also features independent activity of the atria and ventricles.

Abstract: A case of combined, massive overdose of both atenolol and diltiazem in an adult male is reported. Cardiac arrest ensued which was responsive to cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Bradycardia, hypotension, and oliguria followed which were resistant to intravenous pacing and multiple pharmacologic interventions, including intravenous fluids, calcium, dopamine, dobutamine, epinephrine, prenalterol, and glucagon. Adequate mean arterial pressure and urine output were restored only after addition of phenylephrine to therapy with multiple agents and transvenous pacing. The patient survived until discharge after a hospital course complicated by nontransmural myocardial infarct on hospital day 4 and pneumonia. Laboratory testing subsequently revealed high serum levels of both atenolol and diltiazem. The atenolol level of 35 microg/mL in this patient is the highest reported associated with survival.
This case illustrates severe cardiovascular toxicity after overdose of both atenolol and diltiazem. Oliguria, which has previously been reported in severe atenolol overdose, was successfully treated without hemodialysis by the addition of phenylephrine to aggressive therapy with pacing, inotropic, and pressor support.

Abstract: Verapamil intoxications are life-threatening conditions with a far too often fatal outcome. In 2 patients, severe suicidal intoxication by 2.4 g and 9.6 g of verapamil orally resulted in life threatening hypotension and bradycardia with the need of heart-pacing and resuscitation. Plasmapheresis was started within less then 4 hours after intoxication and seemed to reduce the verapamil plasma concentration to less then 40%. A dramatic improvement of cardiovascular stability was already observed during plasmapheresis. In-vitro plasmapheresis was performed to verify the effectiveness of the extracorporeal detoxification. Verapamil was removed out of the blood by a clearance of 29.2 ml/min at blood flow of 200 ml/min. In conclusion, severe verapamil poisoning should be treated by early aggressive gut decontamination and an appropriate management of the haemodynamic complications. In case of lack of effectiveness for stabilisation, plasmapheresis can reduce verapamil related life threatening symptoms and bridge the time for the hepatic detoxification.

Abstract: This case report describes the suicide of a 52-year-old woman whose cause of death was attributed to a mixed-drug intoxication involving venlafaxine and verapamil. Venlafaxine is prescribed for the treatment of depression and should be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular disease. Verapamil is a calcium channel blocker primarily used for treatment of cardiovascular disorders. The following drug concentrations were determined in postmortem fluids: verapamil--3.5 mg/L (femoral blood), 9.4 mg/L (subclavian blood), and 1.0 mg/L (vitreous fluid); norverapamil--1.0 mg/L (femoral blood), 2.1 mg/L (subclavian blood), and 0.20 mg/L (vitreous fluid); verapamil and norverapamil could not be detected in bile or urine due to the high levels of erythromycin present; venlafaxine--6.2 mg/L (femoral blood), 8.6 mg/L (subclavian blood), 5.3 mg/L (vitreous fluid), 54.0 mg/L (bile), and 72.3 mg/L (urine); and O-desmethylvenlafaxine--5.4 mg/L (femoral blood), 8.3 mg/L (subclavian blood), positive (vitreous fluid), 29.2 mg/L (bile), and 9.5 mg/L (urine). The cause of death was determined to be a mixed-drug intoxication resulting from an overdose of verapamil and venlafaxine. The manner of death was determined to be suicide.

Abstract: Calcium channel blockers are widely used in all-aged populations. The drugs are generally safe in therapeutic dosage, but severe side effects with elevated intake are increasingly described, mainly in adult patients. We report an adolescent girl who intentionally ingested an overdose of nifedipine.

Abstract: Overdose with calcium channel blockers (CCBs) may lead to serious complications. CCBs act by blocking calcium entry into the cell, thus lowering intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i). [Ca2+]i during CCB overdose has not yet been reported. We measured [Ca2+]i in lymphocytes of a patient with acute verapamil overdose with a complex clinical picture. A 59-year-old woman was admitted after a suicidal ingestion of 7200 mg of a sustained-release verapamil preparation. She presented with hypotension, complete atrioventricular block, stupor, hypokalemia, and hyperglycemia. Acute oliguric renal failure, acute pancreatitis, and the adult respiratory distress syndrome further complicated her medical course. Treatment was supportive and she recovered completely. Intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) was measured in the patient's lymphocytes using a spectrofluorometer with the calcium-sensitive dye Fura-2-acetoxymethyl ester. Thirty nine hours after the ingestion, [Ca2+]i was low at 52 nM (compared with 80 nM in a healthy control subject). Lymphocytic [Ca2+]i did not respond to stimulation with phytohemagglutinin (PHA). Fourteen days after the verapamil overdose, after the patient had recovered completely, lymphocytic [Ca2+]i was still low at 55 nM. At this time, there was an incomplete response to PHA in the lymphocytes. Three months after the ingestion, [Ca2+]i was normal, with a normal response to PHA. Verapamil overdose may run a complex clinical course, but full recovery is to be hoped for with full supportive care. Cellular intoxication, as reflected by low lymphocytic [Ca2+]i, is prolonged and lags behind the clinical recovery by weeks.

Abstract: A 15-year-old female survived a total of 65 minutes cardiac arrest following ingestion of verapamil and selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors. We consider that the lack of neurological damage, despite evidence of significant renal and myocardial injury, may be related to the possible neuroprotective effect of a large dose of verapamil.

Abstract: To describe our experience with the use of percutaneous cardiopulmonary bypass as a therapy for cardiac arrest in an adult patient intoxicated with verapamil.
Case report.
Emergency department of a university hospital.
A patient with cardiac arrest after severe verapamil intoxication.
Percutaneous cardiopulmonary bypass and theophylline therapy.
A 41-yr-old white male had taken 4800-6400 mg of verapamil in a suicide attempt. On arrival of the ambulance physician, the patient was conscious with weak palpable pulses and was transported to a nearby hospital. The patient developed a pulseless electrical activity, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation was started. Despite all advanced life support efforts, the patient remained in cardiac arrest. Therefore, he was transferred under ongoing cardiopulmonary resuscitation to our department, where percutaneous cardiopulmonary bypass was initiated immediately (2.5 hrs after cardiac arrest). The first verapamil serum concentration obtained at admittance to our institution was 630 ng/mL. After several ineffective intravenous epinephrine applications, the administration of 0.48 g of theophylline as an intravenous bolus 6 hrs and 18 mins after cardiac arrest led to the return of spontaneous circulation. The patient remained stable and was transferred to an intensive care unit the same day. He woke up on the 12th day and was extubated on the 18th day. After transfer to a neuropsychiatric rehabilitation hospital, he recovered totally.
In patients with cardiac arrest attributable to massive verapamil overdose, percutaneous extracorporeal cardiopulmonary bypass can provide adequate tissue perfusion and sufficient cerebral oxygen supply until the drug level is reduced and restoration of spontaneous circulation can be achieved.

Abstract: A 48-year-old man drank 150 mL of an aqueous solution containing potassium dichromate 22.5 g in a suicidal attempt and was admitted 7 hours after the ingestion. Hemodialysis was promptly undertaken and chromium concentrations in serum, erythrocytes, and dialysate were determined during the treatment. Chromium elimination in urine was monitored during hemodialysis and the subsequent 400 hours. The total chromium eliminated via hemodialysis and urine was calculated as 36.7 mg or 0.16% of the ingested dose. Spontaneous urinary elimination proceeded according to an open one-compartment model. The elimination half-life was 71.37 hours +/- 17.13 hours (95% CI). Chromium elimination from serum followed an open two-compartment model, with the half-lives of 3.16 hours +/- 2.63 hours for phase 1 and 50 hours +/- 27 hours (95% CI) for phase 2. Calcium-EDTA therapy had no influence on erythrocyte, serum, or urine chromium level. It contributed, however, to a significant increase in chromium elimination rate in the dialysate. Serum zinc was very low at admission and serum zinc, copper, and magnesium were controlled during the initial 30 hours.

Abstract: We present a case of glyphosate-induced cardiogenic shock in a young man. The patient a 26-year-old man, presented with nausea and vomiting 4 hours after attempting suicide by drinking 150 mL of glyphosate surfactant. Cardiogenic shock with accelerated idio-ventricular rhythm on electrocardiography developed after admission. Intravenous injection of epinephrine, atropine, and calcium failed to improve the condition. Over the next 16 hours, the QRS complex gradually narrowed, sinus rhythm returned, and the hemodynamic status improved. Echocardiograms revealed diffuse left ventricular hypokinesis with markedly reduced ejection fraction while the patient was in shock; normal left ventricular function resumed the next day. In this case, the glyphosate surfactant poisoning-induced shock may have been due to transient suppression of the cardiac conduction system and contractility, rather than intravascular hypovolemia.

Abstract: This case series documents the clinical courses of 4 patients after verapamil overdose and 1 patient after amlodipine-atenolol overdose. All subjects had hypodynamic circulatory shock (hypotension, bradycardia, and acidosis) that was not adequately responsive to conventional treatment. After initiation of insulin-dextrose infusion, the hemodynamic status of all 5 patients stabilized and all patients survived. Plasma drug concentrations are reported for all cases and verapamil levels were extremely high in 2 patients (3710 ng/mL and 3980 ng/mL). However, because patients were not treated according to a standard protocol, each patient received variable other supportive measures and inotropic agents, and the infusion rates of insulin were variable among patients. This report provides preliminary evidence toward a larger trial of insulin-dextrose to treat hypodynamic shock from calcium channel blocker overdose.

Abstract: The purpose of this study was to provide the first description of the effects of ingestion of low-concentration hydrofluoric acid in a population reported to a regional poison control center.
A retrospective analysis of data collected by trained personnel using a standardized data collection system was performed. All charts involving hydrofluoric acid exposures for a 2-year period from a certified regional poison control center were identified by a computerized search. Each chart was abstracted by trained and blinded personnel.
There were 1,772 exposures to hydrofluoric acid; 135 involved ingestion. There were 99 cases of human hydrofluoric acid ingestion for analysis. All ingestions involved consumer products containing 6% to 8% hydrofluoric acid. Symptoms, most commonly mild gastrointestinal effects, were reported by 49 patients. Two patients with minimal effects during an observation period of 2 to 4 hours deteriorated suddenly and died. All other patients recovered completely. Of 29 cases in which calcium concentrations were recorded, 4 cases of hypocalcemia occurred. All patients who had major effects or died were adults who had ingested more than 3 ounces of hydrofluoric acid with suicidal intent. Death occurred precipitously in patients who had appeared well a few minutes earlier.
Death occurred in 2 patients, both of whom were adults who had ingested more than 3 ounces with suicidal intent. Ingestion of a household product containing hydrofluoric acid is a potentially life-threatening condition that requires close monitoring and prompt therapy. The abrupt deterioration and lack of warning signs indicate the need for better diagnostic methods.

Abstract: A 47-year-old man presented with acute renal failure following oxalate ingestion. Nausea and hematoemesis appeared four hours after attempted suicide and acute oliguric renal failure ensued the following day. The patient underwent four sessions of hemodialysis and then reverted to normal state. Histopathologic examination of renal biopsy specimen revealed the degeneration of the renal tubular epithelial cells associated with intracellular calcium oxalate crystal deposition. Most of the renal tubules were patent despite the intraluminar crystal deposition. These findings suggest that dysfunction of the renal tubular epithelial cell plays a more important role than tubular obstruction in developing acute renal failure.

Abstract: A 35-year-old man attempted suicide by subcutaneous self-administration of hydrofluoric acid (5 cc of a domestic rust removal solution containing 7% hydrofluoric acid). A burn 9 x 7 cm in diameter immediately appeared at the injection site (left forearm and fold of the elbow). In the emergency department, the burn was copiously washed with isotonic solution and treated with cutaneous and subcutaneous injections of magnesium chloride, 10% solution of calcium gluconate, and 2% xylocaine, then continuously maintained under topical treatment with calcium gluconate. Seven hours after injection, the patient was severely hypocalcemic (Ca+2 0.64 mmol/L). Ten hours after injection, in addition to the persistent hypocalcemia (Ca+2 0.81 mmol/L), hyponatremia (123 mmol/d), hypokalemia (3.4 mmol/L), and hypochloremia (95.6 mmol/L) had developed. The hypocalcemia was corrected with infusion of calcium gluconate (8.92 mEq of Ca+2 as total amount). The patient underwent surgical intervention 7 days after admission, followed by several interventions of plastic surgery.

Abstract: Electromechanical dissociation (EMD) occurred in a 20-year-old woman 48 hours after an overdose of atenolol, despite intensive treatment of the beta-blocker poisoning (gastric lavage, charcoal, glucagon, epinephrine, atropine, correction of electrolyte abnormalities, administration of fluids, cardiac pacing, and mechanical ventilation). Administration of calcium chloride during EMD repeatedly restored blood pressure. Therefore it may have a role to play in management of atenolol overdose.

Abstract: We report here on a 73-year-old woman who ingested 3.6 g (40 mg x 90 tablets) of verapamil in a suicide attempt. On arrival, the patient was awake and well oriented. Two and a half hours after ingestion, she lost consciousness, as her heart rate and blood pressure began to decrease. Cardiac monitoring showed atrioventricular dissociation. Although she suffered from extreme hypotension, an echocardiogram revealed that the wall motion of the heart was almost normal, and cardiac output measured with a Swan-Ganz catheter was well preserved. The plasma verapamil concentration in this patient was 1499 ng/ml 4 h after ingestion. Hyperglycemia and hypokalemia, laboratory data revealed, continued for 18 h after admission. The patient was successfully resuscitated with intravenous saline, dopamine, and norepinephrine. Besides reporting on this case, we also report on a treatment for severe verapamil overdose.

Abstract: Ethylene glycol poisoning is an important toxicological problem in medical practice because early diagnosis and treatment can prevent considerable morbidity and mortality. When ingested in the form of antifreeze or other automotive products, ethylene glycol results in central nervous system depression, cardiopulmonary compromise, and renal insufficiency. Metabolism of ethylene glycol to organic acids is required for metabolic derangement and organ damage. Laboratory features of ethylene glycol poisoning include increased anion gap metabolic acidosis, increased osmolal gap, calcium oxalate crystalluria, and detectable ethylene glycol in serum. This Case Conference integrates discussion of the toxicokinetic and analytical variables that affect the laboratory diagnosis of ethylene glycol intoxication.

Abstract: A 69-year-old male radio technician drank an unknown amount of a liquid and died within 5 h at a hospital. Mainly silver, potassium, and calcium, among other substances, were found in the residue of the liquid from the empty bottle by means of the spectrographic method (30.7% silver and 25.5% potassium using atomic absorption spectometry [AAS] method). The toxicological analysis of the postmortem material for silver performed by the flame AAS method (stomach, 2.43 micrograms/g; intestines, 1.12 micrograms/g; liver, 6.29 micrograms/g; kidney, 4.85 micrograms/g; spleen, 30.1 micrograms/g; heart, 10.8 micrograms/g; lung, 14.8 micrograms/g; and brain, 0.61 microgram/g) confirmed fatal silver compound poisoning. The results were verified by the standard additions technique and recovery examination. However, no increase in the potassium concentrations was observed in the postmortem material. There have been no data in available literature on the distribution of silver in tissues in people after oral administration of silver salts.

Abstract: Ethylene glycol is commonly found in automobile antifreeze and a variety of other commercial products. Ingestion of ethylene glycol, either accidentally or in a suicide attempt, is characterized by severe acidosis, calcium oxalate crystal formation and deposition, and a wide variety of end organ effects that may be fatal. We present a case of a patient who ingested a massive amount of ethylene glycol in a suicide attempt and yet survived with minimal sequelae. A comprehensive review of the literature on the pathology and pathophysiology of ethylene glycol toxicity on each organ system is provided, along with information on diagnosis and current treatment recommendations.

Abstract: To report a nonfatal intentional overdose of amlodipine.
A 42-year-old woman with a history of hypertension reported ingesting 50-100 mg amlodipine besylate and at least 40 ounces of beer in a suicide attempt. The patient's symptoms were mild; BP ranged from 79/50 to 113/76 mm Hg and HR from 92 to 129 beats/min (sinus tachycardia). Laboratory studies revealed normoglycemia, mild metabolic acidosis, mild hypocalcemia, blood ethanol concentration of 263 mmol/L, and a serum amlodipine concentration of 88 ng/mL (normal 3-11) 2.5 hours after ingestion. Therapy included activated charcoal, whole bowel irrigation, and intravenous NaCl 0.9%. After receiving 1.5 L of NaCl 0.9%, the patient developed signs of mild pulmonary edema that resolved over several hours without intervention. A serum amlodipine concentration obtained 35 hours later was 79 mg/mL. The patient was discharged on day 2 in good condition.
In this case, an amlodipine overdose was associated with sustained hypotension and sinus tachycardia, as well as transient pulmonary edema following relatively low-volume fluid replacement. A previously published report described an amlodipine overdose that was fatal due to refractory hypotension and was complicated by concomitant oxazepam overdose.
Amlodipine overdose produces prolonged hemodynamic effects and may lead to pulmonary edema. Due to a long elimination half-life and delayed onset of effects, patients with amlodipine overdose should receive aggressive decontamination therapy and may require extended clinical monitoring and supportive care if they are hemodynamically unstable.

Abstract: Ethylene glycol poisoning is a rare yet potentially fatal illness seen most commonly in association with ingestion by alcoholics or in suicide attempts. It is characterized by an elevated anion gap metabolic acidosis, osmolal gap, calcium oxalate crystals in the urine, and a well-defined clinical picture. Prompt treatment is crucial because effective intervention can prevent the neurologic, cardiac, pulmonary, and renal sequelae associated with ethylene glycol poisoning. Hemodialysis offers rapid clearance of ethylene glycol and its toxic metabolites. In this article, the case of a hemodialysis patient who suffered contamination of the dialysate solution with ethylene glycol, leading to altered mental status, coma, and severe anion gap metabolic acidosis, is reported. Despite prolonged dialysis and correction of the acidosis, the patient remained comatose and subsequently died.

Abstract: A fatal case attributed to amlodipine intoxication is presented. The deceased was a 15-year-old girl who allegedly ingested 14 10-mg Istin tablets. Amlodipine concentration in peripheral blood was determined (2.7 mg/L) and was compared with published therapeutic and toxic data for amlodipine and some other dihydropyridine calcium channel-blocking agents. Amlodipine concentrations in liver, blood, and stomach contents were also determined.

Abstract: We describe two cases of pulmonary edema, bradycardia, and hypotension associated with massive verapamil overdose. A noncardiogenic etiology of the pulmonary edema was indicated in one patient by normal thermodilution cardiac output and pulmonary artery occlusion pressure, and in the other patient by a normal echocardiogram. We hypothesize that calcium channel blocker overdose predisposes patients to develop pulmonary edema.

Abstract: To describe the elimination of diltiazem and desacetyldiltiazem in an overdose situation.
An 18-year-old woman ingested controlled delivery diltiazem 14.94 g in a suicide attempt. After arriving at the hospital unresponsive and hypotensive, her condition progressed to complete heart block, cardiogenic shock, asystole, and acute renal failure. Supportive care consisted of vasopressors, intravenous calcium, intravenous glucagon, charcoal hemoperfusion, temporary transvenous pacing, and an intraaortic balloon pump. After 12 days in the hospital, the patient recovered fully.
We report a large, documented overdose of diltiazem and detail the pharmacokinetic profiles of both diltiazem and its active metabolite, desacetyldiltiazem. Nonlinear elimination of diltiazem appears to occur at higher concentrations. Although the patient improved clinically following charcoal hemoperfusion, no dramatic effects on diltiazem elimination were apparent.
Survival following massive diltiazem overdose can be achieved with supportive care. Charcoal hemoperfusion had a limited effect on improving the clearance of diltiazem as evidenced by serial plasma concentrations.

Abstract: A case of diltiazem overdose with significant hemodynamic compromise is presented. Multiple therapeutic modalities were attempted with limited results. Control was finally achieved with a combination of norepinephrine, dobutamine, and cardiac pacing. Invasive pulmonary monitoring parameters are reported and were important in the management of this patient. The management of calcium channel blocker overdose and the various available therapeutic modalities are discussed.

Abstract: Heterotopic ossification and rhabdomyolysis are well described entities but, as far as we know, their association has never been described in the literature. We recently treated a patient who presented with this association. After a suicide attempt, this patient developed rhabdomyolysis of the left upper and lower limbs with peripheral neurological impairment. Two months later radiographs showed ectopic ossification around the left hip. Rhabdomyolysis is underdiagnosed, and is due to local disturbance of the calcium-phosphorus metabolism resulting in soft tissue calcifications. Underlying rhabdomyolysis may be a possible aetiology of heterotopic ossification. Recognition of this may help us to understand the pathophysiology and to improve the management of heterotopic ossification.

Abstract: Poisonings due to ingestion of a calcium channel or beta-adrenergic blocker have been the subject of several previous reports, but reports of poisoning due to combined ingestion of these drugs are infrequent. This is a report of suicidal ingestion of nifedipine 600 mg, metoprolol 200 mg, and etizolam 20 mg. Intravenous dopamine, norepinephrine, and calcium chloride had little effect but the administration of methylprednisolone and glucagon were associated with an increase in systolic blood pressure above 100 mm Hg.

Abstract: A 31-year-old male technician in an electroplating factory, who had been suffering from the temporal lobe epilepsy for 24 years and from hypertension for 2 years, took an unknown amount of potassium cyanide apparently over the lethal dose, in an attempt to commit suicide. He was treated successfully and survived without any neurological sequelae. The electroencephalograms and the nature of the seizures were not different before and after the poisoning. The T2-weighted magnetic resonance images at 9 and 51 days after the poisoning showed bilateral elevation of signals in the caudate nuclei and the putamina. At the 143th and 286th days. T2-weighted high-resonance areas were restricted to the lateral portion of the putamina. The T1-weighted images at the 51st day showed abnormal signal elevations in both putamina, while those of 9th, 143th and 286th days were mainly normal. Selective vulnerability of the putamen and the caudate nucleus may be due to their specific structural properties of high oxygen and glucose utilization, and enzyme distribution. Both chronological changes of striatal damage and the absence of neurological sequelae in this patient suggest the possibility that anti-epileptics and a calcium antagonist played a neuroprotective role in the acute cyanide intoxication.

Abstract: To report the presentation and controversies regarding therapy of an 18-year-old man following a life-threatening ingestion of verapamil.
An 18-year-old man ingested large quantities of dipyridamole, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, amoxicillin, and verapamil. He presented to an outlying hospital and was initially conscious. Soon thereafter, the patient had a seizure; he required intubation, developed cardiac conduction abnormalities, and became hypotensive. The patient required pharmacologic pressors and a pacemaker for transfer to our institution. At our institution, vigorous fluid resuscitation, cardiac pacing, and careful attention to acid/base and electrolyte management provided the basis of therapy. The patient recovered without deficit and was discharged from the intensive care unit five days later.
Current controversies regarding the management of verapamil overdose are reviewed. Removal of the drug by gastric lavage is a mainstay of therapy. Administration of syrup of ipecac is contraindicated. Although specific recommendations for calcium dosing in the overdose situation have not been rigorously studied, maintenance of a normal serum ionized calcium concentration is suggested. An exogenous catecholamine, rather than dopamine, may be the drug of choice for treating hypotension. Cardiopulmonary bypass provides a method for drug removal in cases of severe toxicity; however, this invasive method requires further study. Management of fluid/electrolyte, acid/base, and ventilation abnormalities is required to treat large ingestions of verapamil. Treatment guidelines for critical care clinicians are provided.

Abstract: We present a case of diltiazem overdose in which the patient ingested 4.2 grams in an apparent suicide attempt. He arrived in the emergency department two hours postingestion with a blood pressure of 60/40 torr and a heart rate of 62 beats/min in a junctional rhythm. Intervention included activated charcoal, gastric lavage, intravenous fluids, calcium (both chloride and gluconate), dopamine, and atropine with improvement in vital signs. Diltiazem levels were obtained and half-life calculated. This ingestion is one of the largest reported in the literature and is remarkable in that the patient recovered without pacing or other extraordinary measures. All eight previously published cases of diltiazem overdose, including all unpublished reports to the manufacturer, are reviewed and their management strategies examined. Successful treatment in which recovery has occurred in less than 48 hours, includes pressors, calcium, glucagon, pacing, and charcoal hemoperfusion. A strategy for emergency physicians to use when approaching this problem is suggested from the review.

Abstract: We describe a 38 year-old female who ingested 900 mg of diltiazem. She experienced hypotension, bradycardia and heart block but responded well to supportive care that included normal saline infusion and vasopressors. Calcium administration was not beneficial. Serial plasma concentrations of diltiazem, N-demethyldiltiazem and desacetyldiltiazem were quantified. By comparing the elimination half-life for diltiazem with historical controls, it is concluded that multiple dose charcoal therapy was not beneficial for our patient.

Abstract: Survival following attempted suicide in a 50-year-old man by ingestion of 12.4 g of mexiletine, 620 mg of nifedipine and 50 to 100 tablets of sublingual nitroglycerine 1:150 is reported. Initial presentation was that of mental obtundation, vomiting, tonic-clonic seizure, high-degree atrioventricular block, profound vasodilation and cardiovascular collapse. Treatment consisted of intravenous calcium gluconate and aggressive fluid management. Maintenance of cardiovascular stability required continuous infusion phenylephrine, dopamine and epinephrine. The patient made a full recovery and was medically discharged on the fourth hospital day. This case represents the largest overdose of mexiletine to date to end in patient survival.

Abstract: Vasodilators, specifically calcium-channel modulators, are currently in widespread use for the treatment of essential hypertension. Several reports of toxicity from immediate-release verapamil have appeared in the literature. We present a case of sustained-release verapamil overdose as a consequence of an attempted suicide. The treatment measures used in a verapamil toxicity are discussed, as well as a review of the current literature on verapamil overdose.

Abstract: A 34-year-old female was brought to the emergency department after taking 200 to 250 mg of nifedipine and drinking an unknown amount of ethanol in a suicide attempt. She was hypotensive, acidotic, mildly hyperglycemic, and exhibited a conduction abnormality on the ECG. The patient was treated with IV fluids, thiamine, and calcium infusion. The patient was later found to have an endocardial cushion defect with a patched ventricular septal defect and an atrial septal defect of the ostium primum type. We did not observe any untoward effects due to the combination of drugs and congenital abnormalities that could be explained on an individual basis. Nifedipine overdose associated with alcohol intoxication, to our knowledge, has not been previously reported.

Abstract: A 50-year-old man with ischaemic heart disease took 98 tablets of diltiazem 60 mg with alcohol. He developed a junctional bradycardia, hypotension and reduced cardiac function refractory to intravenous calcium gluconate. He survived with temporary cardiac pacing and infusion of dopamine. As much as half the dose was vomited back, but nonetheless the plasma diltiazem concentration reached 6090 micrograms/l before falling mono-exponentially with a half-life of 8.6 h. Sinus rhythm returned when the plasma concentration of diltiazem was around 750 micrograms/l. Standard resuscitative procedures sufficed to treat massive diltiazem overdosage.

Abstract: Records of the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME) for the State of Maryland were reviewed for all deaths related to acute ingestion of antifreeze (ethylene glycol [EG]) occurring between December 1985 and December 1987. Six cases were identified. In three cases, the manner of death was classified as undetermined, in two suicide, and in one case the intoxication was considered to have contributed to death, but was not the main cause. Clinically, the hospitalized subjects exhibited primary metabolic acidosis with hypocalcemia, hyperglycemia, and an elevated anion and osmolar gap. At autopsy, the findings related to EG ingestion were typical of a non-specific drug intoxication. Histological examinations in five cases demonstrated the presence of calcium oxalate crystals in the renal tubules; in three cases extensive renal tubular necrosis appeared related to the survival time. The toxicological analysis in three cases revealed lethal EG levels in the blood.

Abstract: A 41-year-old man ingested 6.8 g of verapamil in a suicide attempt. The patient was severely hypotensive, oliguric, and developed a variety of dysrhythmias. He was also hyperglycemic. The patient was successfully resuscitated with intravenous normal saline, calcium chloride, dopamine, and norepinephrine. A review of the manifestations of verapamil intoxication and suggestions for management are outlined.

Abstract: Ethylene glycol and glycolate kinetics were studied in two cases of ethylene glycol intoxication with maximal ethylene glycol/glycolate concentrations of 40.9/26.8 and 56.4/22.4 mmol/liter, respectively. Both patients survived, but with prolonged renal failure, upon treatment with bicarbonate, ethanol, and hemodialysis. Glycolic acid was the major cause of the metabolic acidosis in both cases; lactate levels were only slightly elevated. Kinetic calculations showed that both ethylene glycol and glycolate were distributed in total body water with plasma half-lives of 8.4 and 7.0 hours, respectively. The half-life of ethylene glycol was increased more than 10-fold by ethanol treatment alone. Calcium oxalate monohydrate crystalluria was dominant in both cases, but in one was preceded by a short period with mainly dihydrate excretion; crystalluria was not present upon admission. Repetitive urine microscopy in search of needle- or envelope-shaped crystals should be performed when ethylene glycol intoxication is suspected.

Abstract: Verapamil is a widely used calcium channel blocker. Side effects with oral use are usually mild, however, major hemodynamic complications and death can occur if the drug is given in overdose. We describe a case of cerebral infarction associated with attempted suicide with verapamil overdose, the first reported to our knowledge.

Abstract: A case is reported of a patient presenting to the psychiatric unit of our hospital with symptoms of depression and found to have an organic psychosis. On routine SMA-12 investigation (12 channel auto analyzer), elevated serum calcium was detected on admission leading to the diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT). The surgical removal of a parathyroid adenoma was followed by a rapid return of biochemical abnormalities to normal ranges. In spite of appropriate psychiatric management and fluctuations in the patient's clinical condition, the organic psychosis was unaltered and culminated in suicide 4 months after admission.

Abstract: Acute intoxication with verapamil (2400 mg) induced A-V dissociation and circulatory failure in a 38-year-old woman with no previous cardiac disease. Resumption of A-V conduction was observed after administration of orciprenalin, calcium gluconate, and dopamine, with no effect on blood pressure. Epinephrine infusion finally restored satisfactory blood pressure level and allowed a favorable outcome.

Abstract: A woman hospitalized because of attempted suicide with diazepam tablets was found to have hypercalcemia and other signs of hyperparathyroidism. Electroencephalogram indicated a brain lesion which was confirmed by a brain scan and angiogram.
