Abstract: This report describes a case of major depressive disorder with peripartum onset in a 24-year-old African-American female who was admitted to the inpatient psychiatric facility after a suicide attempt. The patient demonstrated what we will describe as heralding symptoms during the birth of her second child, but her symptoms dramatically worsened one month prior to her admission with the birth of her third child. The patient presented with anxiety and depressive symptoms, including decreased energy, disrupted sleep patterns, and emotional lability. At the time of her admission, the patient had failed treatment with bupropion, which had been prescribed by her obstetrician. During her stay, the patient was treated with fluoxetine and participated in group therapy sessions. The patient gradually exhibited improvement in her depressive symptoms during the course of her six-day stay. At the time of discharge, the patient's depression was adequately managed with her medication regimen, and she was eager to be reunited with her newborn child. This case highlights the idiosyncratic nature of major depressive disorder with peripartum onset and the need for providers to tailor the treatment to the patient's need.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex disease that is often treated with dopaminergic medications such as carbidopa-levodopa and now with innovative interventions such as deep brain stimulation (DBS). While PD frequently presents with depression and apathy, research must elucidate whether its treatment modalities have an additive or synergistic effect that can lead to an increased suicide risk. DBS has been associated with depression, behavioral changes, and suicidality while dopaminergic treatment has also been shown to cause behavioral changes such as hypersexuality and impulsivity. Considering the now frequent practice of utilizing both DBS and carbidopa-levodopa to treat PD, it is crucial to understand how to properly manage PD patients who are displaying this overlap in symptomology.
A 56-year-old Caucasian male with a 6-year diagnosis of PD who was being treated with high dose carbidopa-levodopa and left DBS of the ventral intermediate nucleus (VIM) presented after a suicide attempt. The patient was found to be severely depressed and had exhibited behavioral changes in the weeks leading up to the attempt. Imaging was performed to assess positional changes of DBS and carbidopa-levodopa dosage adjusted while under close observation in the inpatient unit. The patient was started on fluoxetine to treat the depressive symptoms and was eventually discharged with close monitoring.
With PD and DBS being associated with behavioral changes and depressive symptoms and carbidopa-levodopa therapy being linked to behavioral changes such as impulsivity, it is important that these patients be closely monitored and research analyzes how these factors may interact and lead to an increased risk of suicide. Furthermore, when symptoms appear, a clear protocol must be established on managing these patients. We therefore recommend an approach that utilizes imaging to assess any changes in DBS placement, dose management of carbidopa-levodopa, and behavior monitoring in an inpatient setting.

Abstract: A 14-year-old young adult took an overdose of 1.2 g of fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) that he had been prescribed for depression. He had a generalised tonic/clonic seizure at 6 hours postingestion.After the seizure, he developed signs consistent with serotonin syndrome: fine tremor, agitation, sweating and hyperreflexia. This was followed by severe muscle pain and rhabdomyolysis with peak creatine kinase (CK) of 33 941 at 74 hours. He was managed with intravenous fluids and analgesia and discharged after 4 days, having avoided renal injury. The use of SSRI's such as fluoxetine in teenagers has increased in recent years. While it is generally considered benign in overdose, this report illustrates the severe consequences of overdose at high quantities and discusses appropriate management in these cases. We note that in this case, there was a delayed onset of rhabdomyolysis with peak CK at 74 hours postingestion.

Abstract: Management of severe vasoplegic shock in overdose can be very challenging. We describe a case of severe refractory vasodilatory shock in poisoning where methylene blue (MB) was used with success. However, the patient subsequently developed severe Serotonin Syndrome (SS) as a result of an interaction between serotonergic drugs and MB.
A 15-year-old male developed severe vasoplegic shock 1.5 hours after overdosing on several different medications including quetiapine slow release, quetiapine immediate release, desvenlafaxine slow release, venlafaxine, amlodipine, ramipril, fluoxetine, promethazine and lithium. His vasoplegic shock was resistant to high doses of noradrenaline and vasopressin. MB was administered 6.5 hours post ingestion and within 1 hour there was an improvement in his hemodynamic status and reduction of catecholamine requirements. Twelve hours post ingestion, he developed severe Serotonin Syndrome that lasted 5 days as a result of interaction between MB, a reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAO-I), and the antidepressants taken in overdose. MB had a calculated half-life of 38 hours.
MB is a useful additional strategy for severe drug induced vasodilatory shock and may be potentially life-saving. Clinicians should be aware that it can interact with other drugs and cause life-threatening Serotonin Syndrome. Lower doses or shorter durations may be wise in patients at risk of this interaction.

Abstract: Common side effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) include tachycardia, drowsiness, tremor, nausea, and vomiting. Although SSRIs have less toxic side effects compared to more traditional antidepressants, serious and life threatening cases of SSRI overdose have been reported. We describe a 24-year-old multimorbid female who presented to the emergency department with rapid onset ascending sensorimotor paralysis, complicated by respiratory and cardiac arrest, found to have fatal levels of fluoxetine by toxicological analysis, not taken in a suicidal act.
Autopsy was performed at the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner's Office of a female with no evidence of traumatic injury. Toxicological analysis revealed lethal levels of fluoxetine, toxic levels of diphenhydramine, and multiple other coingested substances at nontoxic levels. Neuropathological examination of the brain and spinal cord revealed no evidence of Guillain-Barre paralysis.
Lethal levels of fluoxetine and multiple potential drug-to-drug interactions in our patient likely contributed to her unique signs and symptoms. This is the first case reporting neurologic signs and symptoms consisting of rapid onset ascending sensorimotor paralysis, hearing loss, respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, and death in a patient with lethal levels of fluoxetine.

Abstract: Few reports exist about the treatment of body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) in patients who are suicidal. This case report describes a 19-year-old male with BDD who had delusional-intensity beliefs about facial disfigurement that had gradually intensified over a 2-year period. However, he was initially misdiagnosed with depression partly because he was admitted immediately after a suicide attempt that was associated with depressive symptoms and social withdrawal, symptoms that subsequently proved to be secondary to his BDD. The symptoms resolved completely and his social functioning returned to normal after 8 weeks of inpatient treatment with fluoxetine and cognitive behavioral therapy. This report is a reminder that suicidal behavior and ideation can have many causes; to avoid misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment, clinicians should consider other possibilities before assuming that suicidal behavior or ideation is the direct result of depression. We discuss the many changes in the understanding and diagnostic classification of BDD since it was first reported by Enrico Morselli in 1886. 
对治疗伴自杀行为的躯体变形障碍 (bodydysmorphic disorder, BDD) 的病例报道较少。本文报道了一位患有 BDD 的19岁男性患者，两年来认为自己面部变丑，这一信念逐渐加重，几乎达妄想程度。然而，他最初被误诊为抑郁障碍，部分原因是他企图自杀，当时存在抑郁症状和社会退缩。后来经证实，这些症状是继发于 BDD 的。经过8周住院治疗，采用氟西汀和认知行为治疗相结合，患者的症状彻底改善，社会功能也恢复正常。这一病例提醒我们，自杀行为和意念有多方面原因；为了避免误诊和不恰当的治疗，临床医生只有在排除其它可能的原因后才能推断自杀行为和意念是抑郁症的直接结果。本文也讨论了自1886年 Enrico Morselli 首度报道 BDD 后，在理解 BDD 和 BDD 的诊断标准上的诸多变化。.

Abstract: Beth, whom you have cared for in your primary care practice since she was born, is a 15-year-old adolescent girl with no prior psychiatric history who developed significant symptoms of clinical depression, associated with self-injurious behavior (cutting on wrists, arms, and thighs). She denied any known precipitant for her depression.She is a ninth grade honors student in the gifted program at a local high school and is described as a talented musician, playing multiple musical instruments as well as soccer and basketball. She has good family support, was sociable, and had several close friends. She denied any history of trauma and denied ever using recreational drugs or other mood-altering substances.At this visit, she reported feeling "sad and anxious." Family history was significant for maternal depression, which persisted through her teens and twenties. Her older sister had been diagnosed with Social Anxiety Disorder. Beth reported anhedonia, fatigue and irritable mood, lack of motivation, impaired concentration, and anxiety related to failing grades.You decide to begin medication because of the severity of her symptoms, and 1 week after starting fluoxetine 10 mg, she reportedly overdosed on an unknown quantity of acetaminophen. Within a few days of switching to escitalopram (due to persistent gastrointestinal complaints while taking fluoxetine), she developed homicidal ideation. She reported feeling grandiose, empowered, invincible, elated, and "crazy," although she never demonstrated or endorsed psychotic symptoms. She became fixated upon the idea that she could kill someone and "get away with it." At the time she tried to suffocate a peer with her hands, she was described as having "a glazed over look in her eyes." Moods were now described as alternating between depressed and elated, with mood shifts occurring every few days. These symptoms did not improve after the antidepressant medication was discontinued.Subsequently, patient was admitted for acute psychiatric care, at which time she was described as depressed, but with an "expansive and irritable" mood, and with obsessive suicidal ideation. She had developed a plan to hang herself in the home. She started to believe that her mother was trying to give her "poison." She reported panic attacks and said that she wanted to be in the hospital where she could feel "safe." She claimed to have an "entity inside of her body who was a bully" and who was "taking over her body" and stated that he put her hand over her peer's mouth, as she watched.Psychological testing included the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-Adolescent, showed significant paranoia, bizarre mentation, and poor reality testing. Along with interview and observation, it was determined that patient met criteria for the DSM-IV-TR clinical diagnosis of Other Specified Bipolar Disorder, with psychotic features.Aripiprazole was initiated at a dosage of 2 mg; however, moods were still described as fluctuating between extremes every few hours. It was discontinued after reaching 5 mg due to affective blunting. Risperidone 0.5 mg twice daily helped patient to feel and act "more like herself"; however, she continued to report significant depression. The addition of lamotrigine 25 mg daily, in addition to individual Dialectical Behavior Therapy, finally led to improvement of mood and a gradual return of her normal baseline, with reportedly stable emotional, social, and academic functioning.The patient's mother remained convinced that this adolescent's mood instability was caused by underlying hormonal problems so you refer her to endocrinology. Beth developed puberty at age 8, with menses occurring on average of twice yearly. She was found to have elevated free testosterone level of 8.6 (reference range, 1.2-7.5). She was of normal weight (body mass index = 21.85 kg/m) and did not manifest acne, male pattern hair thinning, or hirsutism. Thyroid functions, 17-OH progesterone, follicle-stimulating hormone/luteinizing hormone, and estradiol were within normal limits. Prolactin elevation (46.3) was assumed to be due to Risperidone. Patient refused ovarian ultrasound.After starting oral contraceptives to establish monthly menses, patient's emotional and behavioral symptoms continue to remain stable. After Beth decided on her own to discontinue psychotropic medications, she continued for 17 months following her initial visit to remain free of neuropsychiatric symptoms.Now that her symptoms seem resolved; you wonder what the medical diagnosis for Beth was? You wonder if "hormones" may have caused or contributed to her psychiatric presentation.

Abstract: Obsessive-compulsive disorder is a chronic and disabling condition that often proves to be treatment resistant. Of the patients suffering from obsessive-compulsive disorder, 10%-27% may attempt suicide at least once in their life. We report the case of a patient who presented severe obsessive-compulsive disorder symptoms and attempted suicide ingesting 25 tablets of fluoxetine (20 mg). The patient was treated with venlafaxine and agomelatine and showed improvement of obsessive symptoms and suicidal ideation. Future studies are needed to investigate this treatment regime in large cohorts of obsessive-compulsive disorder patients with suicidal ideation.

Abstract: Trends in forensic toxicology show the introduction of rapid analytical methods for the simultaneous quantitative analysis of drugs. The authors present a fatal case involving a 32-year-old male, found dead in bed by his mother, with several blue, white and orange pills next to the body. Empty tablets were found in the trash bin and a suicide note was on the desk. He was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and had been under psychiatric treatment, having repeatedly demonstrated intent to commit suicide. A rapid method was developed to determine 55 different medicines and 32 benzodiazepines in blood by ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) with electrospray ionization source in positive and negative ion mode. Chromatographic analysis was preceded by an optimized solid-phase extraction procedure using Oasis(®) HLB (3 cc, 60 mg) extraction columns. The extracted analytes were separated by UPLC (Waters) with a reversed-phase Acquity UPLC(®) HSS T3 (2.1×100 mm id, 1.8 μm) column with acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid in water as mobile phase, at 0.5 mL/min flow rate and a chromatographic run-time of 8 min. Analytes detection was achieved with a triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer in positive and negative electrospray ionization mode with multiple reaction monitoring (MRM). Two MRM transitions were monitored for each target-compound and one for each deuterated internal standards. Toxicological results showed high blood concentrations of antipsychotics (haloperidol, olanzapine and quetiapine), antidepressants (fluoxetine and paroxetine) and anxiolytics (bromazepam and lorazepam). Risperidone and other benzodiazepines were also present in therapeutic concentrations. Neither alcohol nor illicit drugs were present in the analyzed samples. The UPLC-MS-MS method showed to be appropriate for screening, identification and quantitation of antipsychotics, antidepressants, anxiolytics and antiepileptic drugs in blood after intake of therapeutic as well as toxic doses. The autopsy and toxicological results led the pathologist to rule that death was due to a mixed-drug intoxication. The manner of death was determined to be suicide.

Abstract: Brain MRI and ¹⁸F-FDG PET/CT scans were performed in a patient who had survived a suicide attempt by fluoxetine overdose. The patient presented with the following clinical signs and symptoms, and neuroimaging findings: severe signs of serotonin toxicity, including comatose state, akinetic rigid syndrome and dysautonomia; bilateral globus pallidus changes consistent with extensive pallidal necrosis and subsequent reversible diffuse ischemic changes in white matter, with posterior predominance, involving the splenium of the corpus callosum on brain MRI; and marked hypometabolism in the frontal, parietal and temporal cortical regions as well as in both caudate nuclei on ¹⁸F-FDG PET/CT performed 37 days later. These findings suggest that acute severe serotonin toxicity can induce structural and long-standing functional changes in multiple cortical and subcortical brain regions that are associated with cognitive and extrapyramidal syndromes.

Abstract: Both moclobemide and fluoxetine are used in the treatment of depression, and have been shown to produce fewer side effects than conventional tricyclic antidepressants. A combination of moclobemide and fluoxetine has been used in refractory depression, however there is potential for severe serotonin toxicity. We describe a lethal case of serotonin toxicity in a 36 year-old woman after she ingested multiple drugs, including moclobemide 4500 mg, fluoxetine 200 mg, propranolol 300 mg and several benzodiazepines. The clinical features included coma, mydriasis, hyperthermia, tremor, hyperreflexia, rhabdomyolysis, renal failure and respiratory insufficiency. Eventually, the patient died of disseminated intravascular coagulation and circulatory collapse at 22.5 h postingestion. Toxicological analysis of the patient's blood confirmed high levels of moclobemide 150 μg/mL (therapeutic 1-3 μg/mL), fluoxetine 3750 ng/mL (therapeutic 47-469 ng/mL) and several benzodiazepines. In conclusion, a combination of moclobemide and fluoxetine should be avoided in depressed patients with high suicidal tendencies. Moreover, early recognition and aggressive intervention are the mainstays in the management of potentially life-threatening serotonin toxicity.

Abstract: Since being introduced into clinical practice 20 years ago, fluoxetine, a serotonin-reuptake inhibitor, has remained one of the most popular antidepressants prescribed in the United States. Upon reviewing the literature, the highest reported postmortem central blood fluoxetine and norfluoxetine concentrations are 22 and 6.8 mg/L, respectively, and reported liver fluoxetine and norfluoxetine concentrations are 29-128 and 17 mg/kg, respectively. A 31-year-old female with convulsive activity was found at home by her husband. Emergency services was contacted, and responders found the patient unresponsive with agonal respirations, a pulse of 20 bpm, and no measurable blood pressure. Despite all resuscitative efforts, the patient expired. Postmortem analyses revealed concentrations of 33 mg/L fluoxetine and 12 mg/L norfluoxetine in central blood and 400 mg/kg fluoxetine and 460 mg/kg norfluoxetine in liver. Vitreous fluoxetine and norfluoxetine concentrations were 5.2 and 2.2 mg/L, respectively. Utilizing a sensitive and specific analytical procedure, we report the highest recorded central blood and liver fluoxetine and norfluoxetine concentrations.

Abstract: The antidepressant milnacipran is a double serotonin/noradrenalin reuptake inhibitor. The low reported incidence of intoxication indicates excellent tolerance in comparison with tricyclic and second generation antidepressants. We report a fatal intoxication associating milnacipran, at blood levels (femoral=21.5 mg/l, cardiac=20 mg/l) 40-fold higher than the usual treatment concentration, and six other molecules (fluoxetine, norfluoxetine, sertraline, cyamemazine, nordazepam and oxazepam) at therapeutic levels. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported fatal intoxication involving milnacipran.

Abstract: This is the first longitudinal report on possible psychosis resulting from the juvenile onset of hypothyroidism. A 10-year follow-up in the case of a 13-year-old boy published in this journal in 1993 is presented. The patient presented with a diagnostic dilemma. Although psychosis resulting from hypothyroidism was the most parsimonious explanation of his symptoms (new-onset auditory hallucinations, severe obsessions, and severe hypothyroidism), a primary psychiatric disorder (obsessive-compulsive disorder [OCD] or psychotic depression) aggravated by hypothyroidism could not be excluded. The aim of this study was to illustrate that the diagnosis and clinical interrelationships can be clarified by longitudinal data. FOLLOW-UP DATA: The patient's symptoms responded optimally to a combination of fluvoxamine, risperidone, and levothyroxine (LT4, 300 microg daily). He was free from severe symptoms until age 21, when he discontinued all psychotropic medications while continuing with LT4. Over 2 months later, he was hospitalized for thoughts of hurting himself or others. In the hospital, his LT4 was discontinued and propranolol was started. He was discharged on multiple psychotropic medications, and was rehospitalized 6 days later for suicide risk. When LT4 (200 microg daily) was added to his psychotropic regimen, he partially responded and was discharged. The optimal response to treatment occurred only after he was placed on a combination of fluoxetine, risperidone, and LT4 (300 microg daily). The patient remained stable for up to 12 months of follow-up.
This chronology suggests that the optimal treatment in this patient probably required three components: a Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor, (SSRI) risperidone, and LT4 (300 g daily). Each component was apparently necessary but not sufficient individually for the optimal response. The relapse after the discontinuation of fluvoxamine and risperidone (but not LT4) suggests the presence of a primary psychiatric disorder (OCD with depression). The failure to improve without an adequate dosage of LT4 suggests that hypothyroidism was probably an aggravating factor. This case illustrates the diagnostic difficulty in distinguishing between obsessions, depressive ruminations, and delusions in children and the need to consider hypothyroidism in the differential diagnosis of the sudden worsening of OCD, or in cases of new-onset psychosis in children and adolescents.

Abstract: Cholestatic liver injury can be caused by a variety of drugs and is difficult to treat. We report two patients, a 22 year old male and a 55 year old female, with drug induced cholestasis caused by anabolic-androgenic steroids (silabolin and nandrolone) and by fluoxetine, respectively. Both patients presented with massive jaundice and severe pruritus resulting in sleep deprivation and suicide ideation. Laboratory examination revealed signs of cholestasis. Medical treatment was ineffective; therefore, extracorporeal albumin dialysis using the molecular adsorbent recirculating system (MARS) was started. Three treatments with a mean duration of 16 hours were performed in each patient. The procedure was well tolerated by the patients and resulted in a sustained relief of pruritus as well as in a decline of plasma bilirubin and serum 3alpha-hydroxy bile acid levels. The mean plasma bilirubin concentration decreased from 25.27 mg/dl to 10.7 mg/dl; the mean serum 3alpha-hydroxy bile acid concentration decreased from 299 micromol/L to 88 micromol/L. After 2 months, the pruritus had nearly vanished in both patients, and there was a further decline of bilirubin levels after discharge from hospital. In conclusion, extracorporeal albumin dialysis appears to be a therapeutic option in severe drug induced cholestasis refractory to medical treatment.

Abstract: We report the case of a 22-year-old woman presenting major depressive episode with severe akathisia after an increase in fluoxetine. The patient developed severe restlessness and de novo suicidal ideation approximately 1 week after the dosage of fluoxetine was doubled, 1 year on from when the drug was first introduced. This case illustrates the importance of being alert to movement disorders in patients treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. The clinical implications are discussed. A management strategy based on the evidence in the existing literature is suggested.

Abstract: We report a case of severe hypokalemia and flaccid muscle paralysis following a suicide attempt associating the calcium channel blocker amlodipine, the antidepressant fluoxetine and barium carbonate. Despite rapid correction of severe, life-threatening hypokalemia, areflexic quadriplegia persisted, suggesting a direct effect of barium on muscle cells. Continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) was initiated. We determined barium concentration in the urine, plasma, and hemodiafiltrate during CVVHDF. We subsequently calculated the amounts of barium eliminated both by the CVVHDF and the kidneys. CVVHDF triples the measured barium elimination, reduced serum barium half-life by a factor of three, stabilized serum potassium levels, and rapidly improved motor strength, with complete neurological recovery within 24 h. Presentation and treatment of barium intoxication are discussed.

Abstract: We report a case of a 39-year-old male with bipolar affective disorder who was admitted to hospital with an intentional acute lithium intoxication resulting in renal insufficiency. The patient had previously been treated with lithium, risperidone, fluoxetine and lorazepam, and successfully titrated to lithium levels of 0.7 mmol/l. After overdosing, the lithium level was 5.89 mmol/l and haemodialysis was initiated. A full pharmacokinetic time profile of lithium was obtained. After successful haemodialysis treatment, lithium levels recovered below toxic levels of 1.5 mmol/l in 53 hr. Without intervention non-toxic levels were not expected to have been reached within 6 days, based on computer simulation of predialysis levels. The patient was discharged 6 days after admission without residual symptoms. It was concluded that the lithium intoxication resulted from a combination of lithium overdose and subsequent renal insufficiency due to the overdose. A possible fluoxetine-risperidone interaction was not considered clinically apparent.

Abstract: Compromised organ donors are generally not accepted for heart transplantation (HT) despite the increasing number of critically ill patients on the waiting lists. By extending the donor criteria to include certain cases of intoxication, the organ shortage may be reduced.
The case of a successful orthotopic HT with an allograft from a donor poisoned by antidepressant overdose is presented.
Early graft function was satisfactory with anteroseptal dyskinesis and an ejection fraction of 75% on echocardiography. The cardiac allograft recipient suffered some postoperative complications including gastrointestinal problems. The following period was up to now uneventful. Discharge from the intensive care unit was after 4 days. In-hospital stay was prolonged at 26 days.
Because of limited myocardial toxicity, donor hearts from certain victims of antidepressant intoxication may be safely used for HT. Existing cardiac organ donor criteria must be reevaluated to maximise the available organ pool.

Abstract: With the clinical availability of fluoxetine in the United States, we were interested in documenting improvements in the clinical care of dysthymic patients beyond what was reported from our clinic 2 decades earlier during the "tricyclic (TCA) era."
In open treatment of 42 consecutive DSM-III-R primary dysthymic patients who were personally followed up in our mood clinic since 1988, response was defined as sustained remission, i.e., no longer meeting criteria for dysthymia and achieving DSM-III-R Axis V Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) score > 70 throughout much of the mean follow-up of 5 years.
Compared to patients with nondysthymic episodic major depressive disorder (N = 42), dysthymic patients had a significantly earlier mean age at onset (12.6 vs. 34 years), were more likely to have never been married, had a greater frequency of superimposed major depressive episodes (except for the 14% [N = 6] with "pure" dysthymia), and had more psychiatric and fewer medical comorbidities; furthermore, patients with dysthymia had significantly greater familial loading of both unipolar and bipolar disorders. Continued treatment with TCA-type antidepressants or fluoxetine (including various augmenting strategies) led to an overall robust and sustained response rate of 76% (N = 32) among dysthymic patients; in tandem, major depressive episodes and suicidality were prevented in all responders. Females treated with fluoxetine had the highest response rate (85% [N = 17]); some were able to walk out of dependent abusive relationships for the first time in their lives. However, dramatic responses with "hyperthymic" switches in temperament occurred in only 12% of dysthymic patients; nearly all were males with bipolar family history. The more prototypic positive change among dysthymic responders consisted of coping with daily hassles without being overwhelmed. Qualitatively, the highest level of adaptive functioning was observed among fluoxetine-treated dysthymics (50% of responders [N = 12] achieved DSM-III-R GAF score of 81-90). Of TCA-treated patients, 39% had intolerable side effects, necessitating switch-over to fluoxetine. Agitation occurred in 11% of fluoxetine-treated patients (N = 4) and was associated with nonresponse and/or dropout; otherwise, this selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor was well tolerated, thereby contributing to long-term compliance. More provocatively, patients with dysthymia who had required extensive psychotherapeutic attention prior to state-of-the-art pharmacotherapy no longer required such therapy.
These data extend and enrich what has been learned from controlled trials among dysthymic patients. With sustained pharmacotherapy and specialized clinical care in a private mood clinic, 3 of 4 patients immersed in gloom for much of their lives achieved for the first time good to superior levels of functioning that were maintained for an average of 5 years. Although the art of clinical management of dysthymia should be fully grounded in understanding the interpersonal context of depression, we submit that SSRIs such as fluoxetine appear broadly efficacious in areas previously deemed to be the domain of formal psychotherapy.

Abstract: Paroxetine (Paxil) is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, one of a new class of antidepressants used in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder, and depression. Paroxetine potentiates serotonergic activity through the selective inhibition of serotonin reuptake in the central nervous system. There are few reported overdoses in the literature, and of these, three were fatal. Three coroner's cases in which paroxetine was directly associated with the cause of death are reported. In case #1, paroxetine was the only drug detected in significant concentrations. The heart blood paroxetine concentration was 4.0 mg/L. Case #2 was a known suicide in which the decedent herself admitted taking pills and alcohol. The hospital blood sample drawn at admission was analyzed and contained a 0.25% ethanol level and no paroxetine. Death occurred 10 h later. The postmortem heart blood contained ethanol at 0.06%, paroxetine at 3.7 mg/L, fluoxetine at 0.86 mg/L, and norfluoxetine at 0.65 mg/L. In case #3, death was attributed to an apparent adverse drug interaction between paroxetine and imipramine/desipramine. The postmortem heart blood contained paroxetine at 1.4 mg/L, imipramine at 3.0 mg/L, and desipramine at 9.6 mg/L.

Abstract: This report describes a patient with an acute intentional fluoxetine exposure who developed unique cardiovascular and neurovascular toxicity. The patient presented with lethargy and cardiac conduction delays (QRS 110 msec, QTc 458 msec) and developed a delayed seizure. On admission, therapy with intravenous sodium bicarbonate promptly narrowed the QRS to 90 msec. A comprehensive toxicology screen demonstrated only a serum fluoxetine concentration of 901 ng/mL (therapeutic range, 37-301), a serum norfluoxetine concentration of 451 ng/mL (29-329) and a serum acetaminophen concentration of 174 mg/L. Tricyclic antidepresants were specifically noted to be absent. A self-limiting generalized seizure was witnessed 16 hours after ingestion. At this time the bicarbonate infusion had been ceased and the QRS interval was not prolonged. The patient improved over time and no other apparent causes for the observed clinical effects could be discovered. Emergency physicians need to be aware of the uncommon occurrence of fluoxetine-induced cardiotoxicity and the potential benefit of sodium bicarbonate therapy.

Abstract: Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and major depression are common ailments that can cause significant dysfunction throughout the life cycle. These two disorders may occur comorbidly. This case series describes 7 pediatric patients (aged 10-16 years) and 4 adults (aged 38-44 years) whose ADHD and comorbid major depression were treated in a naturalistic open clinical fashion. For all 11 patients, symptoms of major depression appeared to respond well to either fluoxetine or sertraline monotherapy. Using starting doses of fluoxetine 10 mg or sertraline 25 mg daily, we did not observe any adverse behavioral activation or clinical deterioration. However, no improvement in ADHD symptoms was observed in any patient during fluoxetine or sertraline monotherapy. Adjunctive treatment with a psychostimulant seemed necessary for chronic ADHD symptoms to be effectively addressed. The psychostimulants did not appear to provide observable antidepressant effects. With the exception of one adult who had a 20 mm Hg increase in diastolic pressure on methylphenidate monotherapy at 22.5 mg daily, the administration and coadministration of these agents were not associated with significant changes in blood pressure or heart rate. No patient developed suicidality, increased aggressiveness, mania, or other problematic side effects. This combination therapy was well tolerated and appeared to be effective in ameliorating both ADHD and depressive symptoms. These cases support previous suggestions that adjunctive treatment with psychostimulants might be a safe and effective intervention for children treated with fluoxetine or sertraline who have persistent ADHD symptoms and suggests that such combined treatment may be suitable for adults as well.

Abstract: Venlafaxine (V) is a second-generation antidepressant approved for use in the United States in 1993. It is a derivative of phenethylamine and is structurally unrelated to first- and other second-generation antidepressants. Nevertheless, its mechanism of action is similar to other antidepressants; it inhibits the reuptake of presynaptic norepinephrine and serotonin. Its major routes of elimination involve O and N demethylation. O-Desmethylvenlafaxine (ODV) is biologically active. Therapeutic concentrations of V and ODV are approximately 0.2 and 0.4 mg/L, respectively. Three cases of drug intoxication involving V are presented. V and ODV were identified by gas chromatography-nitrogen-phosphorus detection after alkaline extraction of the biological specimen. On an HP-5 column, V and ODV elute after bupropion and fluoxetine, but prior to the first-generation antidepressants, sertraline, amoxapine, and trazodone. V and ODV were confirmed by full scan electron impact gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The heart-blood V and ODV concentrations (mg/L) in the three cases were 6.6 and 31; 84 and 15; and 44 and 50, respectively. In Case 1, acetaminophen and diphenhydramine were found in the heart blood at 140 and 2.6 mg/L respectively. In Case 2, amitriptyline, nortriptyline, and chlordiazepoxide were found in the blood at 2.8, 0.5 and 3.3 mg/L, respectively. In each case, the manner of death was suicide.

Abstract: We report the case of a 15-year-old girl with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who developed a severe steroid-induced depression, which was rapidly responsive to ECT. This report adds to the growing body of literature supporting ECT as a safe and effective treatment of affective and psychotic disorders in children.

Abstract: Previous case reports of seizures following fluoxetine overdose have not adequately ruled out ingestion of other substances and have lacked documentation of increased serum drug levels. We present a case of seizure following fluoxetine overdose in a previously well patient with a clear history of sole ingestion. We ruled out the presence of other substances with comprehensive drug screening and documented increased serum levels of fluoxetine and its active metabolite.

Abstract: Propoxyphene overdose is known to cause widening of the QRS complex on ECG. We report a case of a 54-year-old female who ingested approximately 100 propoxyphene hydrochloride tablets in a suicide attempt. She developed a wide complex dysrhythmia which responded to sodium bicarbonate therapy. Propoxyphene-induced wide complex dysrhythmia responsive to sodium bicarbonate therapy has not been previously reported in the literature.

Abstract: Suicidal suffocation by forced oxygen depletion (environmental hypoxia) with carbon dioxide (CO2) and with propane is discussed in two cases. No toxicologic proof was available with the former and circumstantial evidence weighed heavily. The latter case demonstrated inhaled propane by an on-scene transthoracic aspirate; all other toxicology specimens, including brain, liver, blood, kidney, fat, and vitreous, did not contain hydrocarbons. This second fatality was complicated by multi-agent overdose, including diphenhydramine, fluoxetine (Prozac), and nordiazepam. The designation of these deaths as due to oxygen depletion involved careful scrutiny of the autopsy, toxicologic, and scene findings. Complete analysis of all factors surrounding these rarely encountered suffocation deaths is stressed.

Abstract: This case study is of a young man with childhood onset of severe obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). The patient had no clinical improvement during therapeutic trials of clomipramine, fluoxetine, and fluvoxamine, including buspirone augmentation. The patient consumed 50 tablets of fluoxetine in a suicide attempt and experienced a total remission of his OCD symptoms for the first time in his life. This remission lasted approximately 1 month and raises interesting questions about the mechanism of action of the serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Subsequently, the patient was able to achieve a 75% improvement in symptomatology when treated with a combination of fluoxetine and clonazepam. This open report suggests that clonazepam may be an effective augmentation agent to a serotonin reuptake inhibitor in the treatment of OCD.

Abstract: A 19-year-old man who attempted suicide by ingesting approximately 600 mg fluoxetine (Prozac) and 140 mg loxapine (Loxitane) had two episodes of atrial flutter shortly thereafter. Admission serum fluoxetine, norfluoxetine, and loxapine levels were 1,053 ng/mL, 702 ng/mL, and 40 ng/mL, respectively. This case of atrial flutter in association with an overdose of either of these drugs demonstrates the potential for cardiotoxicity with these agents in the overdose setting. Theoretical mechanisms of cardiotoxicity are presented.

Abstract: Enantiomers of thioridazine (TRZ) were determined in postmortem tissues obtained from a patient on chronic TRZ therapy by sequential achiral and chiral high pressure liquid chromatography. Tissue concentrations of (+)-TRZ found in liver, brain, bile and blood were: 6.46, 0.40, 0.48 and 0.07 mg/l or mg/kg, respectively. Concentrations of (-)-TRZ in liver, brain, bile and blood were: 12.2, 0.81, 1.07 and 0.20 mg/l or mg/kg, respectively. These data demonstrate the stereoselective disposition of TRZ in human tissues.

Abstract: We report on a 32-year old woman with bulimia nervosa treated with fluoxetine for depression. Fluoxetine is the only drug currently recommended for the treatment of bulimia. The patient became severely disturbed with tension, irritability, self-damage by cutting and violent, intense, suicidal and paranoid ideation qualitatively different to previous symptoms in the course of her illness. Clinical impression was of a striking association between fluoxetine and these symptoms. We suggest caution when using fluoxetine in bulimic patients with depression who have additional impulsive behaviours such as self-cutting, alcohol and/or drug abuse and shop-lifting.

Abstract: Several studies have indicated that patients with panic attacks have a higher rate of suicide attempts as well as deaths from suicide. Additionally, several investigators have presented case reports of individuals manifesting suicidal and violent behaviors directly and temporally associated with panic attacks. We report on four additional cases and suggest that these findings may explain, in part, the increased rate of suicidal behavior among patients with panic attacks found by some investigators. Furthermore, these case reports offer preliminary evidence that the relationship between violent behavior and the panic state may be clinically significant and deserving of further elucidation.

Abstract: Considerable controversy exists regarding the relationship between fluoxetine and the emergence of suicidal ideation. Three cases are presented of patients who were reexposed to fluoxetine after having previously made a serious suicide attempt during fluoxetine treatment. All three patients developed severe akathisia during retreatment with fluoxetine and stated that the development of the akathisia made them feel suicidal and that it had precipitated their prior suicide attempts. The akathisia and suicidal thinking abated upon the discontinuation of the fluoxetine or the addition of propranolol. The emergence of suicidal ideation during treatment with fluoxetine may be secondary to the development of akathisia. Gradual increments of fluoxetine dose and the prompt recognition and treatment of akathisia may reduce further the rare occurrence of suicidal ideation during fluoxetine treatment.

Abstract: Borderline personality disorder is characterized by many of the symptoms associated with serotonin dysregulation, including affective lability, suicidal behaviors, and impulsive aggression. These provide an ideal clinical model for studying the treatment of these serious symptom presentations. The recent development of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors such as fluoxetine makes it possible to study the role of serotonin in the etiology of affective and behavioral dyscontrol in borderline personality disorder. In this preliminary medication trial, 5 borderline personality disorder patients with severe symptoms resistant to phenelzine and neuroleptics were treated openly with fluoxetine 20 to 40 mg for 8 weeks, with weekly ratings of symptoms. The findings from this work suggested efficacy for fluoxetine in treating the depressive and impulsive symptoms of refractory patients with borderline personality disorder.

Abstract: Self-injurious ideation or behavior appeared de novo or intensified during fluoxetine treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder in six patients, age 10 to 17 years old, who were among 42 young patients receiving fluoxetine for obsessive-compulsive disorder at a university clinical research center. These symptoms required the hospitalization of four patients. Before receiving fluoxetine, four patients had major risk factors for self-destructive behavior including depression or prior suicidal ideation or self-injury. Three hypotheses concerning the apparent association between fluoxetine and these self-injurious phenomena are discussed: (1) coincidence; (2) disorganization of vulnerable individuals secondary to drug-induced activation; and (3) a specific serotonergic-mediated effect on the regulation of aggression.

Abstract: Several fatalities due to fluoxetine combined with other drugs such as ethyl alcohol have been reported. We now report an apparent suicide in which fluoxetine was the only causative agent. Because this drug is widely described as having a wide safety margin, it is important to note concentrations in blood associated with overdose fatalities. The findings by GC/NPD and GC/MS in blood were as follows: fluoxetine 6,000 ng and demethylated metabolite 5,000 ng/mL. Parent compound and metabolite were 13,000 ng/mL each in bile. Details of the analytical method and data from 2,100 National Medical Services cases are also presented.

Abstract: Six depressed patients free of recent serious suicidal ideation developed intense, violent suicidal preoccupation after 2-7 weeks of fluoxetine treatment. This state persisted for as little as 3 days to as long as 3 months after discontinuation of fluoxetine. None of these patients had ever experienced a similar state during treatment with any other psychotropic drug.

Abstract: The response to and management of an acute ingestion of a large quantity of fluoxetine hydrochloride in a 13-year-old boy with Tourette's syndrome and obsessive compulsive disorder is described. The patient's symptomatic course following the ingestion included a grand mal seizure, depressed ST segments on EKG, nausea, dizziness, and headache. In general, the fluoxetine was well tolerated: all of the symptoms and signs remitted spontaneously.

Abstract: The serotonin reuptake inhibitor zimelidine may cause flu-like symptoms and Guillain-Barre syndrome. Guillain-Barre syndrome has not been reported with the use of the structurally related serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine. Flu-like symptoms are described in the manufacturer's literature on fluoxetine but are absent from published studies. We describe a patient who developed flu-like symptoms, urticaria and angioedema 2 days after fluoxetine overdose. There were no neurologic sequelae. This case confirms that fluoxetine may be associated with flu-like symptoms and suggests that, because these symptoms occurred after overdose, they may be dose related. The additional findings in this patient suggestive of allergy, an unusual feature of drug overdose, are discussed.
