Abstract: An 85-year-old women with transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis presented with generalized weakness, elevated liver function test levels, and creatinine kinase consistent with rhabdomyolysis 1 week after starting tafamidis. She was already taking atorvastatin and amiodarone, raising the possibility of a drug-drug interaction inhibiting the breakdown and excretion of atorvastatin, causing drug-induced rhabdomyolysis. (

Abstract: In patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction, recurrent ventricular tachycardia (VT) non-responsive to antiarrhythmic therapies may cause further deterioration of cardiac function and haemodynamic instability. The use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in the setting of haemodynamically unstable VT may allow rhythm stabilization and can be effective in providing haemodynamic stability during VT ablation procedures.
We describe the clinical course of a patient with ischaemic cardiomyopathy and recurrent VTs in the early post-myocardial infarction (MI) period. Nineteen days after MI, the patient started to experience recurrent attacks of VT, which became more frequent and non-responsive to medical treatment including amiodarone and lidocaine. The patient developed cardiogenic shock and a decision was made to institute ECMO. The patient was supported with ECMO for 32 days because of heart failure, refractory VT, and recurrent infections. An electrophysiological study was performed 4 days after ECMO initiation, which revealed a large scar area in the left ventricle. Radiofrequency energy was applied 69 times, rendering the VT non-inducible. Subsequently, VT attacks disappeared and the patient was weaned from ECMO after 32 days. The patient received a left ventricular assist device 5 days post-ECMO weaning and was then transplanted.
There is still no evidence or guidelines regarding patients with refractory VT; however, ECMO support has been successfully used during VT ablation procedures. In this case report, VT ablation had a crucial role in treating the culprit arrhythmia while the implementation of ECMO allowed a complex ablation procedure to be completed safely.

Abstract: Dual atrioventricular nodal nonreentrant tachycardia (DAVNNT) is a rare form of supraventricular tachycardia. In some patients, the presence of a dual pathway physiology results in two paths in the atrioventricular (AV) node with different conduction velocities. An atrial impulse arriving at the AV node may unfold and travel along these two pathways simultaneously, causing two ventricular activations. Thus, the ventricular rate will be twice the atrial rate. DAVNNT is less common than AVNRT, but its frequency may be underestimated. The ECG is crucial to suspect the diagnosis. At first glance it looks like an irregular tachycardia, but a more careful look shows a rhythmic pattern. A sinus P wave followed by two QRS complexes (narrow or wide) should raise suspicion of this arrhythmia. It is often unnoticed by the patient, and ventricular dysfunction due to tachycardiomyopathy is not uncommon. The response of DAVNNT to medication, including beta-blockers, flecainide, and amiodarone is very poor or absent, so the treatment of choice is slow pathway ablation. We report a Case of cardiomyopathy caused by this entity.

Abstract: A 65-year-old man presented with shortness of breath, gradually worsening for the previous 2 weeks, associated with dry cough, sore throat, and diarrhea. He denied fever, chills, chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting. He did not have any sick contacts or travel history outside of Michigan. His medical history included hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, morbid obesity, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and tobacco use. He was taking amiodarone, carvedilol, furosemide, pregabalin, and insulin. The patient appeared to be in mild respiratory distress. He was afebrile and had saturation at 93% on 3 L of oxygen, heart rate of 105 beats/min, BP of 145/99 mm Hg, and respiratory rate of 18 breaths/min. On auscultation, there were crackles on bilateral lung bases and chronic bilateral leg swelling with hyperpigmented changes. His WBC count was 6.0 K/cumm (3.5 to 10.6 K/cumm) with absolute lymphocyte count 0.7 K/cumm (1.0 to 3.8 K/cumm); serum creatinine was 2.81 mg/dL (0.7 to 1.3 mg/dL). He had elevated inflammatory markers (serum ferritin, C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, D-dimer, and creatinine phosphokinase). Chest radiography showed bilateral pulmonary opacities that were suggestive of multifocal pneumonia (Fig 1). Nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 was positive. Therapy was started with ceftriaxone, doxycycline, hydroxychloroquine, and methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg IV for 3 days. By day 3 of hospitalization, he required endotracheal intubation, vasopressor support, and continuous renal replacement. Blood cultures were negative; respiratory cultures revealed only normal oral flora, so antibiotic therapy was discontinued. On day 10, WBC count increased to 28 K/cumm, and chest radiography showed persistent bilateral opacities with left lower lobe consolidation. Repeat respiratory cultures grew Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Table 1). Antibiotic therapy with IV meropenem was started. His condition steadily improved; eventually by day 20, he was off vasopressors and was extubated. However, on day 23, he experienced significant hemoptysis that required reintubation and vasopressor support.

Abstract: Acute antiarrhythmics poisoning represents a challenge in the Emergency Department (ED). These patients often develop malignant arrhythmias in need of exceptional therapeutic measures in the ICU. We report a 47-year-old patient admitted to the ED 5 h after the ingestion of a large dose of amiodarone and flecainide in a suicide attempt. During their ED stay, the patient developed signs of cardiotoxicity evidenced by electrocardiogram and ventricular arrhythmias. The toxicological results showed a level of 4.8 mg/L amiodarone and 2.98 mg/L flecainide. He was successfully treated in the ED using a large dose of sodium bicarbonate and lipid emulsion therapy. After hospital admission, he remained stable, with no need for exceptional therapeutic measures such as mechanical circulatory support, cardiac pacing or ECMO. We emphasize the importance of an early start of pharmacological therapies in the ED, which might improve the outcome in antiarrhythmic acute poisoning.

Abstract: Differential diagnosis of interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) during the COVID-19 pandemic is difficult, due to similarities in clinical and radiological presentation between COVID-19 and other ILDs on the one hand, and frequent false-negative swab results on the other. We describe a rare form of interstitial and organizing pneumonia resembling COVID-19, emphasizing some key aspects to focus on to get the right diagnosis and treat the patient properly.
A 76-year-old man presented with short breath and dry cough in the midst of the COVID-19 outbreak. He showed bilateral crackles and interstitial-alveolar opacities on X-ray, corresponding on computed tomography (CT) to extensive consolidations with air bronchograms, surrounded by ground glass opacities (GGO). Although his throat-and-nasopharyngeal swab tested negative, the picture was overall compatible with COVID-19. On the other hand, he showed subacute, rather than hyperacute, clinical onset; few and stable parenchymal consolidations, rather than patchy and rapidly evolving GGO; pleural and pericardial thickening, pleural effusion, and lymph node enlargement, usually absent in COVID-19; and peripheral eosinophilia, rather than lymphopenia, suggestive of hypersensitivity. In the past year, he had been taking amiodarone for a history of ventricular ectopic beats. CT scans, in fact, highlighted hyperattenuation areas suggestive of amiodarone pulmonary accumulation and toxicity. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) investigation confirmed the absence of coronavirus genome in the lower respiratory tract; conversely, high numbers of foamy macrophages, eosinophils, and cytotoxic T lymphocytes with low CD4/CD8 T-cell ratio were detected, confirming the hypothesis of amiodarone-induced cryptogenic organizing pneumonia. Timely discontinuation of amiodarone and initiation of steroid therapy led to resolution of respiratory symptoms, systemic inflammation, and radiographic opacities.
A comprehensive analysis of medical and pharmacological history, clinical onset, radiologic details, and peripheral and BALF cellularity, is required for a correct differential diagnosis and management of ILDs in the COVID-19 era.

Abstract: A 29-year-old male paramedic on duty in a hospital-based emergency medical service system presented to the emergency room with complaints of chronic midback pain. In 2019, when the patient was on duty and complained of back pain for over 3 days, his supervisor instructed him to go to the emergency room. The patient collapsed and went into cardiac arrest; he received a total of 16 doses of 1 mg epinephrine (10 mL of a 1:10,000 solution), 2 doses of amiodarone, 1 dose of sodium bicarbonate, and an infusion of beta blocker agents, which were administered throughout the resuscitation that lasted for 63 minutes. The patient was discharged 27 days later with a patient cerebral performance category score of 1 and no neurologic deficit. Prolongation of resuscitation attempts can result in good outcomes for selected patients.

Abstract: Arrhythmias are seldom observed in the newborn period and rarely lead to serious consequences. Because they may be a continuation of fetal arrhythmias, newborn arrhythmias are different from those occurring at later ages. Here we describe a case of a newborn presented with tachycardia at birth. A female baby of 1950 grams born by emergency cesarean section for fetal distress at 36 weeks of gestation. Fetal tachycardia of 251 bpm was detected prenatally. Electrocardiography showed supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). Hematological and biochemical tests done were within normal limits. Echocardiography revealed normal anatomy with severe tachycardia, dilated chambers with moderate to severe TR with moderately reduced ventricle function. For persisting SVT intravenous adenosine was administered with no significant decrease in heart rate, then continuous intravenous amiodarone infusion was started resulting in a transient decrease in heart rate, however again increased, hence baby was started on intravenous digoxin which responded well. Repeated echocardiography showed normal cardiac chambers and function. Baby was discharged on maintenance oral digoxin and was gradually weaned and stopped after 12 months of age. Neonatal arrhythmias is not an uncommon condition in newborns, however it should be early recognized and evaluated for a better outcome of the baby. Although the frequency of arrhythmias in the newborn period is not high, SVT are the most frequently observed arrhythmias in this period.

Abstract: Ventricular tachycardia (VT) is often misdiagnosed as supraventricular tachycardia with aberrancy. Twelve-lead electrocardiogram remains a key diagnostic tool to differentiate them while providing insights to aid localization of VT. The use of Valsalva manoeuvre (VM) in terminating VT is not conventionally recommended due to lack of robust evidence of its effectiveness and poor understanding of its mechanism in terminating VT.
A 74-year-old man with history of ischaemic heart disease was admitted with broad complex tachycardia. VT-1 was diagnosed following failed tachycardia termination by adenosine. Haemodynamic compromise necessitated synchronized cardioversion with successful reversion. However, a different VT-2 occurred after cardioversion. VM led to successful termination of VT-2. Subsequently, recurrent episodes of VT-2 occurred with consistent termination by VM. Transthoracic echocardiogram, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, and a coronary angiogram were performed. Findings suggested that these are likely scar-related VT. VT-1 originated from an anteroseptal scar, whilst VT-2, responsive to VM, likely originated from the Purkinje fibres. Patient remained eurhythmic after Day 1 following amiodarone and beta-blocker initiation. An implantable cardioverter-defibrillator was implanted prior to discharge.
VM is one of the vagal manoeuvres which are commonly used as initial management of supraventricular tachycardia. Its role in management of VT is obscure. Anecdotal case series recorded its successful use for managing particular VT. Exact mechanism remains elusive although postulated to involve change in cardiac size during strain and release of acetylcholine.

Abstract: Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) have increased survival for heart failure patients. Individuals with LVADs are a growing patient population with frequent complications and Emergency Department (ED) visits. A 50-year-old female presented to the ED due to a low flow alarm on her LVAD. Upon arrival in the ED she was noted to be in ventricular fibrillation. She was defibrillated with restoration to normal sinus rhythm and was started on amiodarone. An implantable cardiac defibrillator was placed during hospital admission. Amiodarone was continued as an outpatient. Patients with continuous flow LVADs can be in dysrhythmias including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation and remain relatively asymptomatic. We present a rare case of a patient with an LVAD and ventricular fibrillation who was completely asymptomatic in the ED.

Abstract: The deterioration of hepatorenal function due to worsening congestion is relatively common in acute heart failure and carries an independent adverse prognosis. In some patients, the risk of proarrhythmia is increased due to impaired drug metabolism. We described a patient with acute heart failure, polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT), and ventricular fibrillation episodes while receiving loading doses of amiodarone for atrial fibrillation. The occurrence of arrhythmia at the background therapy with a relatively safe antiarrhythmic drug in the settings of moderate cardiac, renal, and borderline liver functional impairment demonstrates that careful evaluation of liver and renal function is mandatory for the prevention of proarrhythmia.

Abstract: SCN5A mutations may present with different clinical phenotypes such as Brugada syndrome, long QT3 syndrome, sick sinus syndrome, atrial fibrillation, dilated cardiomyopathy, and the least known multifocal ectopic Purkinje-related premature contractions syndrome.
We report a case of a 29-year-old woman with palpitations due to multifocal premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) and a family history of sudden death. The previous electrophysiological study had shown that PVCs arose from Purkinje fibres but catheter ablation was unsuccessful. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging demonstrated non-ischaemic areas of subendocardial fibrosis at multiple left ventricular (LV) segments with concomitant dilatation and mild systolic impairment. Amiodarone suppressed the ectopy but caused hyperthyroidism. Due to recent pregnancy, she received no antiarrhythmics which resulted in PVC burden increase and further deterioration of the ejection fraction (EF). After gestation, amiodarone was reinitiated and switched to flecainide after implantation of a subcutaneous defibrillator as a safety net. At follow-up, LV function had almost normalized. Genetic analysis confirmed an SCN5A mutation.
Multifocal ectopic Purkinje-related premature contractions syndrome is associated with SCN5A mutation which in our case (R222Q) is the most common described. Flecainide can be an appropriate treatment option when ablation is ineffective. Defibrillator-even a subcutaneous type-could be implanted in cases of LV dysfunction or scar. PVCs suppression by flecainide and restoration of EF implies an arrhythmia-induced mechanism of LV impairment.

Abstract: Amiodarone is a common medication used widely in clinical practice. It is a triiodinated antiarrhythmic associated with a variety of adverse effects both pulmonary and extrapulmonary, the most serious being amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity (AIPT) or amiodarone lung. This can present with a variety of clinical syndromes ranging from subacute symptoms to an indolent and a progressive course thus mimicking an alternative diagnosis. We report a case of amiodarone lung in a female who presented with an acute fulminant progressive pneumonitis despite being on very low dose (100 mg once daily) that proved fatal. Diagnosis was made on postmortem examination due to a diagnostic conundrum. Despite the steady decrease of AIPT with reduced dose, it is vital for the treating clinicians to monitor regularly for adverse effects and review the need for long-term use to prevent complications.

Abstract: Ventricular tachycardia (VT) is a major contributor to sudden cardiac death, and pharmacologic treatment options beyond antiarrhythmics are limited. Emerging data suggest sympathetic blocking agents such as propofol are a potential management option for VT refractory to first line antiarrhythmics. Previous literature has described fixed-dose propofol boluses and continuous infusions to convert ventricular arrhythmias; however, to our knowledge, there are no reports of a weight-based dosing strategy for VT. We present the case of a patient with amiodarone-refractory VT who received a 1 mg/kg propofol bolus in preparation for cardioversion and subsequently converted to normal sinus rhythm. The patient stabilized following these interventions, transferred to a tertiary care facility, and was discharged home with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator.

Abstract: We report a novel cardiomyopathy associated to Usher syndrome and related to combined mutation of MYO7A and Calreticulin genes. A 37-year-old man with deafness and vision impairment because of retinitis pigmentosa since childhood and a MYO7A gene mutation suggesting Usher syndrome, developed a dilated cardiomyopathy with ventricular tachyarrhythmias and recurrent syncope. At magnetic resonance cardiomyopathy was characterized by left ventricular dilatation with hypo-contractility and mitral prolapse with valve regurgitation. At left ventricular endomyocardial biopsy, it was documented cardiomyocyte disconnection because of cytoskeletal disorganization of cell-to-cell contacts, including intercalated discs, and mitochondrial damage and dysfunction with significant reduction of adenosine triphosphate production in patient cultured fibroblasts. At an extensive analysis by next-generation-sequencing of 4183 genes potentially related to the cardiomyopathy a pathogenic mutation of calreticulin was found. The cardiomyopathy appeared to be functionally and electrically stabilized by a combination therapy including carvedilol and amiodarone at a follow-up of 18 months.

Abstract: Thrombocytopenia is a rare immune-mediated hematologic complication of amiodarone. We describe a case of delayed-onset amiodarone-induced thrombocytopenia in a 72-year-old male and highlight the process of working it up. A timely diagnosis of drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia is crucial in order to minimize unnecessary testing, avoid treatments with potential harm, and prevent life-threatening hemorrhagic complications.

Abstract: BACKGROUND Amiodarone is an anti-arrthymic drug used to treat and prevent several types of dysrhythmias. This drug is known for multiple-organ toxicity. Lung toxicity occurs in about 1% to 5% of cases. A wide variety of lung manifestations have been described, from mild to severe forms. Pulmonary toxicity can be acute, sub-acute, or chronic. Amiodarone-induced lung toxicity is a diagnosis of exclusion. The main treatment is discontinuation of the drug. Lung disease may progress initially due to the prolonged half-life and the accumulation of amiodarone in adipose tissue. Regarding the prognosis, lung toxicity can be reversible, but in some cases, it is irreversible and is sometimes fatal. The risks associated with its use must always be considered. Amiodarone should only be used for short periods. CASE REPORT The authors present a case of a 71-year-old female patient, taking amiodarone 200 mg/day for 18 months. The patient presented with amiodarone-induced lung toxicity. After drug withdrawal, without corticosteroid therapy, we observed clinical, functional, and radiological improvement. CONCLUSIONS This case shows that not all cases of amiodarone-induced lung toxicity require corticosteroid therapy, and highlights that is important to consider this diagnosis in patients on amiodarone therapy with respiratory symptoms.

Abstract: A 10-year-old male American Shorthair cat was presented after a witnessed syncopal event. A Holter monitor demonstrated a long QT interval and revealed a rhythm characteristic of torsades de pointes (TdP) coincident with a bout of syncope. On subsequent Holter monitor recordings, sotalol did not prolong the QT interval further and did not reduce the severity of the underlying ventricular tachyarrhythmias, but no TdP was identified. When another syncopal event occurred, sotalol was discontinued, and oral amiodarone and magnesium were started. This resulted in improvement in the ventricular tachyarrhythmia. No syncopal events occurred in the ensuing 3 months, but the cat died of an unrelated disease shortly after. This is the first report of naturally occurring torsades de pointes in a domestic cat.

Abstract: Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) is a childhood vasculitis disorder that involves the skin, joints, gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and kidneys. It is related to immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibody deposition in small blood vessels. HSP is a self-limiting disorder, but its morbidity is primarily associated with renal involvement. GI pathologies like intussusception, gastritis, duodenitis, ileitis, or ulcer have been reported to be associated with this disease. However, cardiac and neurological complications are rarely reported. We present the case of a 16-year-old, previously healthy male who was diagnosed with HSP after presenting with a non-blanching purpuric rash in the lower extremities. The patient also had joint and abdominal pain, and swelling in the extremities. There was renal dysfunction at presentation with blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 67 mg/dL and serum creatinine of 1.9 mg/dL. The serum albumin was low at 2 g/dL, and the patient had nephrotic range proteinuria. Urine microscopy showed red blood cell casts. A renal biopsy was performed, which showed IgA deposition in glomeruli. He was started on intravenous (IV) pulse methylprednisolone and was later prescribed oral steroids. Four weeks after the treatment initiation, he presented with syncope and acute anemia (hemoglobin of 3.5 g/dL). The fecal occult blood was positive. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was not suggestive of gastritis, duodenitis, or ulcer. The pill-cam capsule endoscopy revealed GI bleeding from the terminal ileum near Meckel's diverticulum. He subsequently required blood transfusions, and the bleeding eventually improved with symptomatic management. Six weeks after treatment initiation, he presented with dizziness and palpitations. The EKG showed the presence of atrial fibrillation, and he had an episode of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia on telemetry. Arrhythmia was diagnosed secondary to HSP cardiac vasculitis, and we initiated treatment with metoprolol and amiodarone. Seven weeks after the initial treatment, he had neurological clinical findings of proximal muscle weakness, tremors, and upper and lower extremity clonus. A second renal biopsy was then performed due to the presence of persistently elevated serum creatinine, which showed 75% of glomeruli with cellular crescents. He was treated with IV cyclophosphamide. Subsequently, the renal function improved. There were no other GI, cardiac, or neurological complications after six months of follow-up. The presentation of HSP can be more severe in adolescents, and they need to be closely monitored for GI, cardiac, renal, and neurological complications after the disease occurrence. Bleeding from Meckel's diverticulum or an episode of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia with HSP has not been previously reported to our knowledge. Arrhythmia is an exceptionally unusual occurrence in HSP, and it is usually treated with anti-arrhythmic drugs and intensification of the immunosuppressive regimen.

Abstract: Amiodarone is a common antiarrhythmic drug that is utilised in clinical practice and is associated with pulmonary toxicity. The most common form of pulmonary complication is interstitial pneumonitis which is treated with discontinuation of amiodarone and initiation of corticosteroids. Amiodarone-induced pulmonary eosinophilia is a rare complication of amiodarone therapy, with blood and pulmonary eosinophilia the predominant features. During the COVID-19 era, the incidence of delay in treatment of pulmonary pathology is also delayed due to the effort of excluding COVID-19 infection. Here we report a case of a 64-year-old man who developed eosinophilic pneumonia after initiation of amiodarone therapy, and the investigations required to exclude other forms of pulmonary toxicity. We also reviewed the effect of COVID-19 testing in the management of patients presenting with respiratory distress.

Abstract: According to the ARISTOTLE trial, apixaban was superior to warfarin because it was associated with fewer strokes, systemic embolism, and bleeding. Hemopericardium was one of the major bleeding events reported in this trial. However, the percentage of patients that developed hemopericardium was not stated in the trial results. We present a case of hemopericardium in an 80-year-old man admitted for dyspnea, cough, and lower extremity edema. He was recently diagnosed with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and started on apixaban for stroke prevention. Prior to admission, he was taking metoprolol succinate and amiodarone for atrial fibrillation. His symptoms resolved after undergoing successful pericardiocentesis. Although hemopericardium is a rare side effect associated with the use of non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs), we suspect that a drug-drug interaction between apixaban and amiodarone (via the cytochrome p450 system and p-glycoprotein efflux pumps), the patient's advanced age, and borderline creatinine are possible risk factors.

Abstract: An elderly Japanese woman developed acute decompensated heart failure caused by persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) and left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Approximately 6 days after starting intravenous administration of amiodarone (600 mg/day) for maintaining sinus rhythm after cardioversion of AF, electrocardiograms revealed a prolonged QT interval associated with torsade de pointes (TdP). The amiodarone-induced TdP disappeared after intravenous administration of landiolol plus magnesium and potassium, without discontinuation of amiodarone or overdrive cardiac pacing, although the prolonged QT interval persisted. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report that landiolol could be effective for amiodarone-induced TdP.

Abstract: Defibrillation is effective and the most common treatment for ventricular fibrillation (VF) and pulseless ventricular tachycardia in patients with cardiac arrest.
Recently we experienced 3 cases refractory ventricular fibrillation (RVF) which was successfully terminated with double sequence defibrillation (DSD) in our emergency department, so we'd like to report and discuss it.
Cardiac arrest.
A single defibrillation 200J was performed twice for patients with ventricular fibrillation in the initial rhythm of the emergency room. At the same time, intubation and intravenous access were achieved and epinephrine and amiodarone were administered. The 400J DSD was performed on RVF patients with sustained VFs, despite several trials of 150-200J defibrillation and adherence to advanced cardiac life support.
All three RVF patients recovered spontaneous circulation after DSD.
The three cases we have shown are small, but DSD improves the chance of spontaneous circulation. Therefore it is suggested that attempts of DSD to patients with RVF, especially in the prehospital stages as a way to improve the return of spontaneous circulation.

Abstract: Thyroid hormones have an integral role in cardiac homeostasis, and hypothyroidism may be associated with impaired myocardial contractility, altered endothelial function, and blunted response to catecholamines. Herein, the case of a patient with undiagnosed severe hypothyroidism, who developed an acute myocardial infarction and cardiac arrest during sedation for bronchoscopy, is described. He required prolonged resuscitation, which included coronary catheterization and placement of an intra-aortic balloon pump. The resuscitation was noteworthy for blunted physiologic responses to large doses of epinephrine; in particular, persistent bradycardia without evidence of conduction abnormalities. On admission to the intensive care unit, he was hypothermic (31.4°C), bradycardic, and hypotensive. Laboratory investigations revealed profound hypothyroidism, and thyroid hormone replacement was initiated. Within hours of initiation of thyroid hormone replacement, the need for vasopressor support was reduced. He had a complete recovery and was discharged home neurologically intact. The authors of the present report believe that this favorable neurologic outcome could be attributed to efficient resuscitation, prompt coronary revascularization, and profound hypothermia likely related to a hypothyroidism-associated hypometabolic state.

Abstract: Sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) in the early postoperative period following intracardiac repair for tetralogy of Fallot is rare. In stable VT, amiodarone forms the mainstay of management. However, where amiodarone and other antiarrhythmic drugs are contraindicated, suppressive overdrive atrial pacing can be used as a safe and efficient alternative to maintain cardiac output. We present a case of 1-year 5-month-old child who developed VT with low cardiac output syndrome with deranged hepatic function, who was managed efficiently using suppressive atrial pacing to ameliorate the effects of sustained VT.

Abstract: Polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (PVT) post coronary artery bypass (CABG) surgery is associated with acute myocardial ischemia, hemodynamic instability, and metabolic derangements. When acute ischemia is suspected, a comprehensive investigation for reversible causes is justified to improve patient outcomes. We present a curious case of incessant, refractory PVT in a patient with an unknown etiology requiring percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) post CABG. The patient was a 73-year-old female with multiple comorbidities who presented to the hospital with anginal chest pain for one day. Initial electrocardiogram (EKG) showed sinus tachycardia with ST-segment depressions in the inferior-lateral leads. Initial cardiac troponin I was elevated at 28.280 ng/mL. Dual antiplatelet therapy and heparin were started. Urgent coronary angiography revealed significant triple-vessel disease, and she subsequently underwent three-vessel CABG. Her postoperative course was complicated by PVT refractory to all antiarrhythmic therapy and ventricular fibrillatory (VF) arrest with the recovery of spontaneous circulation after defibrillation and amiodarone bolus. Despite normal electrolytes and discontinuation of all QT-prolonging agents, PVT persisted. Urgent coronary angiography revealed a patent venous graft to a previously underappreciated severely stenotic distal segment of the left anterior descending artery (LAD). She underwent PCI of the culprit lesion with the termination of PVT. Although acute graft failure is regularly the culprit for acute myocardial infarction perioperatively, emergent coronary angiography post coronary bypass surgery revealed patent grafts and a previously underestimated severe coronary lesion contributing to ongoing ischemia. Post CABG percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) yielded a complete resolution of her arrhythmia.

Abstract: Amiodarone therapy is widely prescribed in patients with atrial fibrillation. The higher prevalence of this arrhythmic heart disease, and the specific age-related issues of homeostasis in the elderly population, makes this group particularly exposed to its adverse effects. Among the many described side-effects, neurological impairments are the less documented and studied. Because amiodarone can be responsible for severe complications, as described in the case below, a close monitoring is necessary throughout its prescription. Awareness should be brought on the amiodarone-induced neurological side-effects as they could be overlooked.

Abstract: Left ventricular thrombosis and cerebral infarction caused by recurrent episodes of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) are uncommon in infants. We present the case of a 23-month-old girl whose echocardiography revealed a left ventricular thrombus, which resolved after sinus rhythm was restored. The girl had experienced repeated systemic convulsions and high muscular tension of the left limb accompanied by movement disorder. Soon afterward, cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed scattered lacunar cerebral infarctions in the right lateral ventricle. The symptoms, signs, and laboratory examination satisfied the diagnosis of left ventricular thrombosis and cerebral infarction caused by recurrent episodes of PSVT. The girl was given antiarrhythmic drugs, including propranolol, esmolol, and amiodarone, intracranial pressure decreasing treatment (mannitol), heart and brain cell nutritional therapy, anticoagulant therapy, and her condition gradually improved. This case report highlights the importance of pediatric PSVT patients' clinical management and that more emphasis should be placed on early recognition and prevention of severe complications. Pediatricians should be trained early recognition of the nonspecific clinical manifestations of PSVT, make effectively and quickly diagnosis by electrocardiogram, evaluation of cardiac function and thrombosis by echocardiography, and termination PSVT as rapidly as possible. Thromboprophylaxis therapy might be considered for recurrent episodes of PSVT.

Abstract: Amiodarone is an antiarrhythmic drug that has been recognized to induce hepatotoxicity. We report a case of acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) in a patient who was receiving amiodarone for more than 2 years. The patient developed cirrhosis and suppurative microabscesses of the liver and died of progressive liver failure.
A 69-year-old woman with risk factors for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) was treated with oral amiodarone at a daily dose of 400 mg for more than 2 years, until she developed epigastralgia and vomiting. Initial laboratory findings included leukocytosis and elevated liver enzymes. Images of abdominal computed tomography scan revealed diffusely increased hepatic attenuation density (in contrast to decreased density in NAFLD), hepatomegaly, periportal edema, and ascites. Liver biopsy targeting the hotspot identified through positron emission tomography confirmed the diagnosis of amiodarone-associated chronic steatohepatitis and superimposed microabscesses. The patient died of progressive ACLF despite intensive supportive care.
Accumulation of amiodarone can result in chronic liver disease and pose an additional risk of ACLF following infection.

Abstract: Bilateral optic disc swelling is an important clinical sign for potentially life-threatening and sight-threatening conditions, with the most common being raised intracranial pressure and pseudopapillitis. Perhexiline-related and amiodarone-related optic disc swellings are diagnoses of exclusion. This report describes the diagnosis of a man with perhexiline-induced and amiodarone-induced optic neuropathy after extensive investigation consisting of full ophthalmic examination, biochemical screen, temporal artery biopsy, CT, MRI, positron emission tomography and lumbar puncture. There was partial to complete resolution of optic neuropathy following cessation of the causative medication. We postulate that the underlying mechanism of perhexiline toxicity could be mitochondrial dysfunction related. Our case demonstrates that patients treated with perhexiline and amiodarone should be monitored closely for ocular side effects.

Abstract: The authors present a case of a 55-year-old gentleman with a medical history of atrial fibrillation on amiodarone who presented with weight loss, palpitations and exertional dyspnoea. Thyroid function tests revealed thyrotoxicosis with a free thyroxine (T4) of 117 pmol/L and a thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) of <0.008 mIU/L. Interleukin-6 level was low. The negative TSH-receptor antibody status, the presence of a small thyroid gland with heterogeneous echotexture and decreased internal vascularity on ultrasound together with the relatively quick drop in free T4 and free tri-iodothyronine (T3) levels once prednisolone therapy was added to carbimazole suggested that this was typical of amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) type 2. Subsequently, carbimazole was discontinued and treatment with prednisolone was continued. This case highlights that AIT management may be challenging and it is of paramount importance to establish the type of AIT present as this will guide management and is key to improving prognosis.

Abstract: A 71-year-old man with a recent diagnosis of pneumonia developed paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and was admitted to the cardiology service. Amiodarone was administered intravenously to restore sinus rhythm. Significant prolongation of the QT interval (QTc = 640ms) was noted and an exceedingly prolonged (over 3 minutes), self-terminating, episode of ventricular flutter/fibrillation occurred during bedside monitoring. The event was terminated without first converting to a more organized ventricular rhythm and without any adverse neurological sequelae. Apart from the long duration of ventricular fibrillation and its spontaneous termination, our case highlights the importance of the continuous heart rhythm monitoring in patients with extreme QT interval prolongation.

Abstract: Atypical presentations of supraventricular arrhythmias constitute a diagnostic challenge which are not frequently reported in literature. Swallowing-induced supraventricular arrhythmia (SI-SVA), which was first described in 1926, is an intriguing presentation of supraventricular tachycardia and occurs during a wet or solid swallow. A 67-year-old man presented to our outpatient clinic complaining from recurrent episodes of sensation of palpitations and short duration pressure on his chest while swallowing since the last 2 weeks. Ambulatory rhythm Holter monitoring was suggestive of atrial fibrillation (AF) or atrial tachycardia attacks during swallowing. In addition, electrocardiography performed during solid food swallowing, showed short duration of AF consistent with the patient's symptoms. The patient was successfully treated with amiodarone. The main cause of SI-SVA is not known. Cross-talk of nerves during the impulse propagation might be the underlying cause of this phenomenon.

Abstract: Permanent junctional reciprocating tachycardia (PJRT) is a rare form of atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia that is commonly resistant to most antiarrhythmic medication therapy and over an extended duration can result in tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy. The prenatal presentation of PJRT is typically similar to that of other types of fetal supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), making it difficult to distinguish from other forms of SVT in utero by fetal echocardiography. Surface electrocardiography after delivery is typically required to make a definitive diagnosis of PJRT. We report a case of fetal SVT at 19 weeks' gestation refractory to maternal transplacental treatment with digoxin, amiodarone, flecainide, sotalol, metoprolol, intraumbilical amiodarone, and fetal intramuscular digoxin over the course of 12 weeks. Repeat cesarean delivery was performed at 30 2/7 weeks' gestation for tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy with hydrops fetalis. Postnatal electrocardiogram and continuous rhythm monitoring confirmed the diagnosis of PJRT. Combined neonatal treatment with amiodarone, digoxin, and propranolol was successful in reestablishment of sinus rhythm, with radiofrequency ablation planned if medical therapy eventually fails or once early childhood is reached. To our knowledge, this is the first described case of fetal PJRT refractory to multiple standard in utero antiarrhythmic modalities and highlights the importance of inclusion in the differential diagnosis.

Abstract: Marijuana has become the most widely used illicit drug in the United States. Approximately 43.5 million Americans aged 12 or above have reported the use of marijuana in the last year. The use of cannabinoids and its relationship with cardiac effects are not well known. Many types of arrhythmias have been noted with the use of cannabis products with atrial fibrillation being the most common arrhythmia associated with the use of cannabis. We present a case of a 36-year-old male who presented with pounding chest pain, dyspnea, and diaphoresis following marijuana use. He was found to be in ventricular tachycardia which responded to amiodarone. Workup done was negative for any structural disease, and cardiac catheterization was negative for coronary artery disease. He was ultimately discharged on metoprolol. In this report, we focus on how marijuana can be associated with many arrhythmias including ventricular tachycardia with focus on mechanisms by which it can occur. We believe a detailed social history with screening for cannabis use can identify more cases of arrhythmias that can be potentially associated with marijuana use.

Abstract: Hyperthyroidism affects approximately 1.2% of the population and its routine treatment includes antithyroid drugs (ATDs), radioiodine and surgery. Management of patients with resistance or contraindications to ATDs who require thyroidectomy may be challenging. We present the experience of our department in preparing thyrotoxic patients for life-saving thyroidectomy by using therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) with albumin: one patient with Graves' disease and previous history of agranulocytosis and cholestatic jaundice after ATDs and two patients with amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis. Five to six TPEs were applied to each patient resulting in a decrease of fT3 by 57% to 83%, fT4 by 21% to 60% and decrease/normalization of total thyroid hormones. All patients underwent surgery successfully. In case of drug-resistant thyrotoxicosis or contraindications to ATDs, TPE can be a valuable tool in preparing patients for surgery. Albumin used as a replacement fluid appears to be effective in ameliorating clinical and laboratory symptoms of thyrotoxicosis.

Abstract: There are two types of amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT). Type 1 AIT is increased synthesis of thyroid hormone, whereas type 2 AIT is excess release of thyroid hormone due to a destructive thyroiditis. However, cases leading to amiodarone-induced thyroid storm are rare.
A 75-year-old man with a history of chronic heart failure, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, and atrial fibrillation was treated with amiodarone from age 72. He was presented to the emergency department with edema of the legs and dyspnea on exertion for 3 weeks. He was diagnosed with thyroid storm associated with type 2 AIT on the basis of no pre-existing thyroid disease and long-term amiodarone administration without appropriate medical attention and thyroid function tests.
This case report suggests that amiodarone can cause not only AIT but also thyroid storm. Regular medical appointment and thyroid function tests can avoid this critical illness.

Abstract: A 63-year-old woman on flecainide, furosemide, and triamterene-hydrochlorothiazide presented with weakness and diarrhoea. She had profound hyponatraemia, hypokalaemia and a pre-renal acute kidney injury (AKI). Her ECG showed a regular wide complex tachycardia concerning for monomorphic ventricular tachycardia. She was haemodynamically stable and treated with aggressive electrolyte repletion and amiodarone. Flecainide toxicity can present as a variety of arrhythmias and early recognition is crucial. This case focuses on flecainide toxicity from multiple concomitant insults: diuretic use, diarrhoea, hypokalaemia, hyponatraemia and pre-renal AKI. We emphasise the importance of close outpatient monitoring of electrolytes in a patient on diuretics and flecainide to prevent life-threatening arrhythmias. We discourage use of multiple diuretics in patients taking flecainide.

Abstract: BACKGROUND Cardiac amyloidosis is an infiltrative cardiomyopathy caused by the extracellular deposition of insoluble precursor protein amyloid fibrils. These depositions of protein amyloid fibrils are found on the atria and ventricles and can cause a wide array of arrhythmias; however, sustained ventricular arrhythmias are quite uncommon. CASE REPORT A 71-year-old man with a history of hypertension developed a sudden onset of shortness of breath, profuse diaphoresis, lightheadedness, and presyncope. Upon emergency medical services' arrival, an initial electrocardiogram revealed wide complex tachycardia with a heart rate of 220 to 230 beats per min. He was subsequently given, in succession, magnesium, adenosine, and amiodarone with no change in heart rate or rhythm. Due to ongoing symptoms of diaphoresis and the development of dyspnea, he underwent direct current cardioversion and was converted from ventricular tachycardia to atrial fibrillation at controlled rates. A transthoracic echocardiogram and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging showed features suspicious for cardiac amyloidosis. A subsequent 99m technetium pyrophosphate single-photon emission computerized tomography scan revealed a grade 3 visual uptake and a heart-to-contralateral lung ratio of 1.92, consistent with transthyretin amyloidosis. The patient was treated with tafamidis and an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator for secondary prevention of ventricular arrhythmia. CONCLUSIONS This case highlights the need to consider cardiac amyloidosis in the differential diagnoses of patients with persistent ventricular arrhythmia and no prior history of heart disease.

Abstract: A young male with long-standing type 1 diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and known ventricular hypertrophy presented with dyspnea and abdominal pain and was diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. On day nine of hospital admission, patient developed ventricular tachycardia with electrocardiogram (ECG) changes and elevation in troponin level consistent with myocarditis and development of cardiogenic shock. Bedside limited echo demonstrated signs of tamponade and patient underwent surgical pericardial window procedure. He was also noted to develop marked prolongation of corrected QT interval (QTc) while on amiodarone.

Abstract: Medication-induced cutaneous hyperpigmentation has variable clinical presentations and is dependent on the specific drug involved. Most commonly, an attentive patient observes such changes early in the course; when missed by the patient, such changes are usually noted by an observant clinician. Clinical diagnosis can be challenging if the patient is on multiple medications because other causes must be excluded. This condition occurs via multiple mechanisms. Frequently, the pigmentary change is reversible with discontinuation of the drug. Causative medications include nonsteroidal; anti-inflammatory agents, antimalarials, antibiotics, psychotropics, amiodarone, and chemotherapeutic agents. The; antimicrobials responsible for hyperpigmentation are antimalarials, tetracyclines, tigecycline, dapsone, rifampicin, and antiretrovirals such as zidovudine. Sunlight exposure can worsen the pigmentation seen with some of the above antimicrobials (e.g., dapsone). Here, we describe an older adult white woman presenting with acute cutaneous; hyperpigmentation of the bilateral lower extremities while on levofloxacin therapy. Hyperpigmentation resolved after cessation of the agent. Our case highlights this unique acute presentation after only a few days of oral levofloxacin.

Abstract: One of the less frequent underlying mechanisms of ventricular tachycardia (VT) is triggered activity. Triggered activity refers to an extrasystole due to a premature depolarization that occurs when the amplitude of an early or delayed afterdepolarization brings the cardiac membrane to its threshold potential. Hydrochlorothiazide and hydroxyzine can prolong repolarization and QT interval and are associated with early afterdepolarizations. Cyclic AMP-mediated, delayed afterdepolarizations can occur as a result of catecholaminergic surge. Delayed afterdepolarization is classically associated with outflow tract (OT) tachycardia, a type of VT that is uniquely defined by its termination with adenosine. We present a case of triggered OT tachycardia for which intravenous amiodarone through its antiadrenergic effect may have been effective. Infusions of magnesium and a cardioselective, β-receptor antagonist that does not prolong repolarization may have been more appropriate given the concurrent, acquired prolonged QT syndrome. After initial stabilization, considering the underlying VT mechanism may prompt the clinician to select the most appropriate, further treatment.

Abstract: Wide complex tachycardias are rare in the pediatric population and may be due to ventricular tachycardia, aberrant conduction or antidromic tachycardia each with multiple underlying etiologies. We present a 14 yo female in extremis with syncope at rest witnessed by her mother, found in ventricular tachycardia by EMS who challenged with IVF hydration and amiodarone. Consecutive adequate fluid challenges and antiarrhythmics in the emergency department failed requiring synchronized cardioversion for stabilization. Subsequent viral panels, imaging, genetic testing and cardiac biopsy confirmed a diagnosis of arrhythmogenic right (and left) ventricular dysplasia.

Abstract: BACKGROUND The energy delivered by a defibrillator is expressed in joules (J). However, current is what actually defibrillates the heart and is related to the voltage-to-impedance ratio. With the same energy, the lower the transthoracic impedance, the higher the current delivered. In obese patients, pushing the chest wall toward the heart during electric shock can result in an improved outcome. CASE REPORT We report the cases of 3 obese patients with previously failed cardioversion/defibrillation who had an eventual shock success. (1) A 17-year-old girl failed multiple defibrillation efforts for her recurrent ventricular fibrillation. After ECMO, with the physician pushing down the chest wall, a 200-J defibrillation converted her VF. (2) A 63-year-old man with recurrent atrial fibrillation (AF) had an unsuccessful 150-J shock followed by a successful 200-J cardioversion. His AF recurred. After amiodarone bolus, a 200-J shock converted it to sinus. Another recurrent AF failed 150-J cardioversion. With chest pushing down, a 150-J cardioversion was successful. (3) A 65-year-old man underwent elective cardioversion for AF. A 200-J shock was unsuccessful. A 200-J shock with pressure on the chest successfully converted it. CONCLUSIONS We performed successful electrical cardioversion/defibrillation with this "pushing down the chest while shocking" method. Many clinicians are still unaware of this method, especially in obese patients. With the increasing prevalence of obesity, it is urgent to perform a randomized study to confirm the efficacy and safety of this method, and integrate it into advanced cardiac life support protocols.

Abstract: Amiodarone is the drug most commonly used to manage arrhythmias. Long-term amiodarone administration causes hepatotoxicity due to iodine accumulation in the liver. Here, we present three cases of amiodarone-induced hepatotoxicity in patients on long-term oral amiodarone therapy who underwent dual-energy computed tomography (DECT).
We report the clinical and iodine density in the liver using DECT in three patients with amiodarone-induced hepatotoxicity. Liver enzymes were increased in these three patients, and abdominal DECT without contrast medium showed highly increased attenuation in the liver. Furthermore, the iodine concentration in the liver was increased. The first patient with amiodarone-induced reversible hepatotoxicity, showed a reversible course of liver function and a decrease in CT values after discontinuation of amiodarone. The second patient on long-term oral amiodarone had increased iodine concentration in the liver and liver damage, the patient eventually developed rapidly progressive pneumonia and died of multiple organ failure. The third patient, showed an increased iodine concentration in the liver and elevated liver enzymes. However, the patient refused radiofrequency ablation for atrial fibrillation and continued oral amiodarone to control atrial fibrillation, and routine liver function tests were required every 3-6 mo in this patient.
DECT is a potentially noninvasive diagnostic tool for quantifying iodine concentration in the liver and monitoring adverse reactions due to amiodarone.

Abstract: Amiodarone is widely used as an antiarrhythmic agent for the treatment of both supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias in various inpatient as well as outpatient settings. Classified as a class III antiarrhythmic agent, it acts mainly by inhibition of potassium channels in the cardiac muscle. Adverse effects are quite common and usually involve pulmonary, gastrointestinal, endocrine, dermatologic, or neuromuscular systems. Although hematologic side effects including thrombocytopenia have also been reported, amiodarone-induced neutropenia is quite rare. We present a case of amiodarone-induced neutropenia in a 66-year-old Caucasian gentleman. He presented to our hospital with cardiac arrest due to ventricular-fibrillation and had received amiodarone as a part of his therapy. His hospital course was complicated by neutropenia which was found to have a clear temporal relation with amiodarone. His initial white blood cell count was 6400/mm3 with an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of 4800/mm3. His ANC started to downtrend and reached a nadir of 400/mm3 at day six of therapy. This improved significantly after stopping amiodarone, without any change in other medications. Given the rapid improvement of his neutropenia with the discontinuation of amiodarone, further workup with a bone marrow biopsy was not performed. Severe selective neutropenia, also known as agranulocytosis, is a life-threatening condition due to increased risk of severe infections. Antiarrhythmic agents such as tocainamide, procainamide, and flecainide are generally known to cause agranulocytosis. The mechanism of agranulocytosis or neutropenia is thought to be mediated by either immune-mediated destruction or direct and indirect toxicity to myeloid precursors. Although amiodarone has been in use for over 20 years in the management of tachyarrhythmias, agranulocytosis as a direct side effect of amiodarone therapy has been rarely reported. It is important to keep in mind this rare but potentially life-threatening adverse effect of amiodarone when initiating therapy.

Abstract: Amiodarone is an antiarrhythmic medication with many side effects. Neuromyopathy is a rare adverse effect. We present an 87-year-old woman with bilateral leg pain and weakness in the context of amiodarone. She was admitted to the Acute Geriatric Unit in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. On examination, hip flexor and extensor strength were 2/5 bilaterally while knee flexor and extensor strength were 4/5 and 3/5, respectively. Creatine kinase and C-reactive protein levels were normal. MRI of the lumbar spine showed mild central canal stenosis. Electromyography and nerve conduction testing showed a severe axonal length-dependent polyneuropathy of the left lower extremity. There was evidence of myopathic changes to the left iliopsoas muscle. Overall, a neuromyopathic process affecting the lower extremities was supported. After discontinuation of amiodarone, mobility and function significantly improved. Although a rare complication of amiodarone, neuromyopathy should be considered in patients with compatible symptomatology.

Abstract: Erysipelas is a common skin infection of the upper dermis. Its most common complications are local; these include abscess formation, skin necrosis, etc. In the present article, we introduce a case of a 75-year-old patient with erysipelas of the face complicated with acute exudative pericarditis. The patient came to Kaunas Clinical Hospital complaining of extreme fatigue and fever, oedema of the left side of the face, and erythema typical for erysipelas. The patient also felt sternum and epigastric pain, especially during breathing, and dyspnoea. Heart work was rhythmic 100 bpm; blood pressure was 142/70 mmHg. Pericardial friction rub was heard over the left sternal border. There were no alterations in other systems. In the electrocardiogram, concave ST segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF was identified. In addition, during hospitalisation, the patient experienced atrial fibrillation paroxysm, which was treated with amiodarone intravenously. The blood test showed C-reactive protein: 286 mg/L; white blood cells: 20 × 10

Abstract: Brugada electrocardiographic pattern, or Brugada phenocopy (BrP), can be found in conditions other than Brugada syndrome. We present the case of a 34-year-old woman who was found convulsing at home followed by ventricular tachycardia (VT) cardiac arrest upon arrival to the emergency department. Electrical direct cardioversion led to a return of spontaneous circulation, and she was started on intravenous amiodarone. The patient had four additional episodes of pulseless VT that returned to sinus rhythm with electrical cardioversion. A subsequent electrocardiogram taken in sinus rhythm revealed a right bundle branch block pattern with a coved ST segment elevation and inverted T waves in leads V1 and V2, suggestive of BrP type 1. Further inquiry revealed that an empty bottle of nortriptyline was found at her home. Nortriptyline intoxication was subsequently confirmed by a serum level of 1581 ng/mL. Treatments with intravenous sodium bicarbonate resolved the BrP, and she fully recovered with supportive care. Intoxication with drugs that inhibit cardiac sodium channels, such as nortriptyline, can trigger a BrP in otherwise normal individuals. Nortriptyline and other tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are used to treat chronic pain, depression, and other conditions but have dose-related side effects and can lead to fatal overdose. Intoxication by these TCAs should be on the differential when a BrP is observed.

Abstract: Diagnosis of amiodarone lung toxicity on computerized tomography (CT) can be challenging especially in the presence of mass-like consolidation. Additional causes of mass-like consolidation including malignancy and pneumonia should be excluded, sometimes requiring tissue sampling.
Here we present a case of amiodarone lung toxicity, with diagnosis suspected based on patient's history of chronic cardiac disease, amiodarone treatment, and imaging characteristics. Evaluation with dual energy CT demonstrated high iodine content in the mass-like consolidation further supporting the diagnosis. Biopsy of the mass-like consolidation confirmed amiodarone toxicity.
Dual energy CT has potential utility in differentiating mass-like consolidation from other etiologies such as malignancy or pneumonia.

Abstract: BACKGROUND Amiodarone, an anti-arrhythmic medication, has been associated with the development of multiple organ toxicities. Most of these toxicities develop insidiously. However, in rare cases, these toxicities manifest with more acute symptoms. We present an unusual case of amiodarone toxicity which manifested with multiorgan failure and systemic inflammatory response syndrome that mimicked sepsis. CASE REPORT A 73-year-old man who was being treated with chronic oral amiodarone for atrial fibrillation presented with flu-like symptoms and fever, pulmonary infiltrate, acute kidney injury, and thrombocytopenia. The patient did not improve with antibiotics and fluid resuscitation. The results of an extensive infectious and non-infectious workup were negative. His symptoms worsened during hospitalization, which correlated with the loading of intravenous amiodarone given for his acute worsening of atrial fibrillation. Amiodarone-induced drug toxicity was contemplated by the treating medical team. Amiodarone was stopped, and the patient was treated with steroids, which improved his symptoms and organ dysfunctions. Subsequent bronchoscopy with lung biopsy showed foamy macrophages with organizing pneumonia and fibrinoid changes. CONCLUSIONS This case highlights an atypical and rare presentation of a complication of chronic amiodarone use that presented with acute onset of fever, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, and multiorgan failure masquerading as sepsis. The patient's symptoms and organ dysfunctions improved with the discontinuation of amiodarone and institution of steroids.

Abstract: We report a 77-year-old human on renal dialysis for end-stage renal disease with heart failure and atrial fibrillation (AF) complicated by a high ventricular frequency. The underlying disease was thought as tachycardia-induced-cardiomyopathy. Intravenous infusion of amiodarone was initiated, and direct current cardioversion succeeded in converting AF to sinus rhythm. Then, excessive increases in the QT and Tpeak-Tend (Tp-e) intervals were seen and hypokalemia induced by hemodialysis led to the development of numerous episodes of torsades de pointes (TdP). Magnesium repletion was effective in preventing TdP, while Tp-e intervals returned to the previous values 2 days after the discontinuation of amiodarone.

Abstract: BACKGROUND Myxedema coma is an uncommon severe thyroid disorder that is fatal in 25-60% of cases. Although the differential diagnosis for altered mental status is extensive, including many more common causes such as infection, medication changes, electrolyte abnormalities, and exacerbation of chronic illnesses, profound hypothyroidism is an uncommon cause that can be overlooked. CASE REPORT We describe the case of a 71-year-old man on long-term amiodarone treatment for atrial fibrillation who presented with altered mental status initially ascribed to uremia, hyponatremia, and pneumonia. When his mental status did not resolve, thyroid tests showed his thyroid-stimulating hormone level was 89 μIU/mL, along with clinical criteria for myxedema coma. CONCLUSIONS We suggest that thyroid function tests should be considered in encephalopathic older adults on amiodarone.

Abstract: A 66-year-old woman with no relevant medical history presented at the emergency department with new-onset atrial fibrillation. We initiated intravenous amiodarone therapy. At 20 hours, the patient experienced severe neurologic symptoms, hyponatremia, and syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone. We discontinued amiodarone, infused saline solution, and restricted the patient's fluid intake. She recovered in 3 days. This case illustrates that amiodarone-induced syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone with hyponatremia can occur far earlier than expected during acute amiodarone therapy.

Abstract: Dronedarone, a drug similar in chemical properties to amiodarone, was designed to have similar pharmacodynamic properties as amiodarone with fewer side effects. Although there have been cases of chronic liver enzyme elevation with dronedarone, only a few cases have been reported in literature where it has led to rapid onset of liver failure. We present the case of an 86-year-old male who developed acute liver failure concomitantly with acute kidney failure after he was started on dronedarone therapy.

Abstract: Implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICD) have become indispensable in managing life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. On average, 50%-70% of the patients receive a device-based therapy within the first two years post implantation. A few patients experience the electrical storm (ES). ES is a syndrome of recurrent ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation occurring two or more times in a 24-hour period, calling for the need of electrical cardioversion or defibrillation to stabilize the patient. We present the case of a patient with severe cardiomyopathy who presented with resistant ES after failing to respond initially to conventional medications like amiodarone and lidocaine. Propofol infusion was not an option due to his severe cardiomyopathy and hypotensive shock state. Aggressive treatment with intravenous medications stabilized his ES and he was eventually transferred to an outside facility for ventricular tachycardia ablation.

Abstract: Atrial fibrillation and heart failure are common coexisting conditions requiring hospitalisation for heart failure and death. Pulmonary vein isolation is a well-established option for symptomatic atrial fibrillation and for atrial fibrillation concomitant with heart failure with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. Recently, pulmonary vein isolation using cryoballoon showed non-inferiority to radiofrequency ablation with respect to the treatment of patients with drug-refractory paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. However, the effectiveness of acute-phase rhythm control by semi-urgent pulmonary vein isolation using cryoballoon in patients with haemodynamically unstable atrial fibrillation storm accompanied with low cardiac output syndrome is unclear. Herein, we present a case in which semi-urgent pulmonary vein isolation using cryoballoon was effective for acute-phase rhythm control against drug-resistant and haemodynamically unstable repetitive atrial fibrillation tachycardia accompanied with low cardiac output syndrome.
A 57-year-old man was hospitalised for New York Heart Association functional class 4 heart failure with atrial fibrillation tachycardia and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction of 20% accompanied with low cardiac output syndrome-induced liver damage. The haemodynamics collapsed during atrial fibrillation tachycardia, which had become resistant to intravenous amiodarone and repeated electrical cardioversions. In addition to atrial fibrillation, atrial tachycardia and common-type atrial flutter appeared on day 3. Multiple organ failure progressed gradually due to haemodynamically unstable atrial fibrillation tachycardia storm accompanied with low cardiac output syndrome. On day 4, to focus on treatment of heart failure and multiple organ failure, semi-urgent rescue pulmonary vein isolation using cryoballoon to atrial fibrillation and cavotricuspid isthmus ablation to common-type atrial flutter were performed for acute-phase rhythm control. Soon after the ablation procedure, atrial fibrillation and common-type atrial flutter were lessened, and sinus rhythm was restored. A stable haemodynamics was successfully achieved with the improvement of hepatorenal function. The patient was discharged on day 77 without complications.
This case demonstrates that acute-phase rhythm control by semi-urgent pulmonary vein isolation using cryoballoon could be a treatment option in patients with haemodynamically unstable atrial fibrillation tachycardia storm accompanied with low cardiac output syndrome, which is refractory to cardioversion and drug therapy.

Abstract: Dabigatran is a direct thrombin inhibitor that is widely used to prevent the formation of thrombus formation. Amiodarone can increase the plasma concentration of dabigatran. CES1 (carboxylesterase 1) and ABCB1 (ATP-binding cassette subfamily B member 1) genetic polymorphisms associate with the pharmacokinetics of dabigatran.
A 62-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital due to chest tightness, fatigue, and discomfort despite long-term anticoagulation with dabigatran 110 mg twice daily for 6 months, with concomitant use of amiodarone.
Left atrial appendage thrombus formation with a history of atrial fibrillation.
The clinician changed dabigatran to warfarin. To explore the causes of insufficient anticoagulation using dabigatran in this patient, we examined the ABCB1 and CES1 genes. Results showed that she carried ABCB1 variant alleles with 3 heterozygote single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs: rs4148738, rs1045642, rs2032582) and CES1 variant alleles with 2 heterozygote SNPs (rs2244613, rs4580160).
The left atrial appendage thrombus disappeared.
Multiple mutations in the ABCB1 and CES1 genes may influence the pharmacokinetics of dabigatran and could have contributed to the thrombus formation in the left atrial appendage.

Abstract: Quinidine is one of the oldest antiarrhythmics known. Over the years, its use has decreased along with its side effects. Our case describes a 69-year-old woman with recurrent resistant ventricular tachycardia on Quinidine and Amiodarone who presented with acute liver toxicity. Drug-induced liver toxicity was at the top of our differential diagnosis list. Taking multiple factors into consideration, a decision was made to discontinue Quinidine, the patient's symptoms and lab abnormalities resolved within 1 week, yielding the diagnosis of Quinidine hypersensitivity.

Abstract: There is an urgent need for effective treatments for coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Amiodarone, like hydroxychloroquine, exerts antiviral actions by interfering with endocytosis and viral replication. Here, to our knowledge, we report the first case of a patient affected by respiratory failure related to COVID-19 who recovered after only supportive measures and a short amiodarone course. (

Abstract: Amiodarone and dronedarone have recognized ophthalmological adverse effects including optic neuropathy. The recognition of optic neuropathy as a complication of amiodarone and dronedarone treatment may enable withdrawing the drug and accordingly preventing permanent vision loss.
This study aimed to describe a case of optic neuropathy after substitution of amiodarone with dronedarone for treatment of atrial fibrillation.
An 81-year-old man treated with dronedarone for atrial fibrillation after amiodarone had caused tremor developed sequential permanent vision loss in both eyes.
The importance of timely recognition of optic neuropathy as a complication of amiodarone and dronedarone treatment may enable discontinuing the drug, thus preventing permanent vision loss.

Abstract: Amiodarone is a class III antiarrhythmic drug, used by cardiologists to treat arrhythmia including atrial fibrillation (A fib) and ventricular fibrillation. However, amiodarone is associated with endocrine dysfunction including both hypo- and hyperthyroidism. In the literature, two types of amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) were described: AIT-1 and AIT-2. Mixed AIT also called AIT type 3 (AIT-3) has been described in the literature when the cases do not have a typical presentation. In order to differentiate different types of AIT, various clinical, biochemical, and radiological tools have been proposed. The use of

Abstract: Amiodarone is associated with a wide variety of side effects, but unusual presentations can make it difficult to diagnose and treat. This case report describes amiodarone causing nodular changes in the lung, as opposed to diffuse interstitial disease. After cessation of the medication, there was marked radiographic improvement in the nodules.

Abstract: Amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) is a complication of amiodarone therapy that can be difficult to diagnose and manage, especially in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). We describe a 47-year-old female patient with DCM who experienced the sudden onset of type II AIT with symptoms mimicking low cardiac output syndrome, namely, general malaise and nausea. Early type II AIT was diagnosed, and effectively treated with prednisolone. <

Abstract: Cardiac lipomas are rare benign heart tumors. Their clinical manifestations primarily depend on their dimension and location. We describe a case of a 14-year-old boy complaining of palpitations. ECG showed non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT). Echocardiography and cardiac MRI showed a large apical mass suggestive of a cardiac lipoma. The patient underwent open-heart surgery which detected a pericardial mass, partially attached to the myocardium, and crossed by the distal segment of LAD. This critical anatomical relationship prevents its complete resection. The biopsy confirmed mature fat tissue. Postoperatively, Propranolol was started for NSVT episodes. After 8 months, he presented with VT recurrence. A subcutaneous ICD (S-ICD) was implanted. Two months later, he was admitted for an electrical storm with six appropriate shocks. Since then, amiodarone was added. Lipomas are not always benign and their surgery might be very difficult and unhelpful. A multidisciplinary team is crucial for their diagnosis and management.

Abstract: One of the drugs that are widely used in the treatment of atrial fibrillation is amiodarone. Despite considerable prolongation of the corrected QT interval and a substantial degree of bradycardia, amiodarone exhibits a remarkably low frequency of pro-arrhythmic events and <1.0% incidence of torsades de pointes, mostly after long-term usage. We present a case of an 80-year-old female with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation accompanied by acute heart failure treated by short-term parenteral amiodarone therapy and development of torsades de pointes.

Abstract: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia. Dronedarone is a new antiarrhythmic used for rhythm and rate control in AF and is associated with reduced mortality in non-permanent AF. It has also been associated with increased mortality in those with heart failure and/or permanent AF. This case report presents the case of hypotensive shock after initiating treatment with dronedarone in a 73-year-old female patient. Shortly after her first dose of dronedarone, she developed hypotension that did not respond to intravenous fluids and was admitted to the intensive care unit for vasopressor administration. Dronedarone was the most likely cause of the hypotension as the patient's blood pressure normalized in 24 hours, which concurs with the half-life of dronedarone. Amiodarone and dronedarone are similar in composition; however, the absence of iodine moieties in dronedarone contributes to its improved side-effect profile. Furthermore, amiodarone has been linked to hypotensive shock likely due to a co-solvent used in some intravenous preparations; however, dronedarone-induced hypotension is less common.

Abstract: Amiodarone, prescribed for cardiac conditions, including dysrhythmia, is associated with bradycardia. However, few reports have demonstrated that bradycardia is observed when amiodarone is used in combination with sofosbuvir, a direct-acting antiviral drug for chronic hepatitis C. We herein report the case of a male patient in his 70s with chronic atrial fibrillation and prostatic hyperplasia and was also taking amiodarone, who experienced severe bradycardia and syncope a day after taking sofosbuvir and ribavirin for chronic hepatitis C. After discontinuing amiodarone, ribavirin, and sofosbuvir, bradycardia did not recur. Therefore, we must consider drug interactions between amiodarone and sofosbuvir in patients with severe bradycardia.

Abstract: We present a unique case study report of a male individual with a history of mild nonischaemic cardiomyopathy, with no ventricular ectopy, that at the age of 76 years sustained multiple concussions (i.e., mild traumatic brain injury) within a week of each other. Concussion symptoms included cognitive difficulties, "not feeling well," lethargy, fatigue, and signs of depression. He was later medically diagnosed with postconcussion syndrome. The patient, WJT, was referred for cardiac and neurological assessment. Structural neuroimaging of the brain (MRI) was unremarkable, but electrocardiography (ECG) assessments using a 24-hour Holter monitor revealed significant incidence of ventricular ectopy (9.4%; 9,350/99,836 beats) over a period of 5-6 months after injury and then a further increase in ventricular ectopy to 18% (15,968/88,189 beats) during the subsequent 3 months. The patient was then prescribed Amiodarone 200 mg, and his ventricular ectopy and concussion symptoms completely resolved simultaneously within days. To the authors' knowledge, our study is the first to show a direct link between observable and documented cardiac dysregulation and concussion symptomology. Our study has important implications for both cardiac patients and the patients that sustain a concussion, and if medically managed with appropriate pharmacological intervention, it can reverse ventricular ectopy and concussion symptomology. More research is warranted to investigate the mechanisms for this dramatic and remarkable change in cardiac and cerebral functions and to further explore the brain-heart interaction and the intricate autonomic interaction that exists between the extrinsic and intracardiac nervous systems.

Abstract: A 70-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital complaining of shortness of breath. She was diagnosed with acute decompensated heart failure due to left ventricular dysfunction. Her symptoms began to improve with standard therapy for heart failure with diuretics, noninvasive pressure ventilation, and inotropes, but paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) occurred. After treatment with amiodarone, the number of PVCs decreased, and the left ventricular wall motion gradually improved. However, on day 28, ventricular fibrillation and cardiopulmonary arrest occurred suddenly, and she could not be resuscitated. She was diagnosed with giant cell myocarditis via an autopsy. The autopsy revealed diffuse inflammatory cells that comprised giant cells and eosinophils as well as cellular degeneration and necrosis. <

Abstract: A double-chambered right ventricle is an uncommon form of congenital heart disease that is characterized by the division of the right ventricle into a proximal high-pressure chamber and a distal low-pressure chamber. A 70-year-old male presented to the emergency room from his outpatient doctor's office with unstable wide complex ventricular tachycardia with right axis deviation. His ventricular tachycardia was terminated using external cardioversion and intravenous amiodarone. He was subsequently found to have new-onset heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction and a right ventricular tract outflow obstruction on transthoracic echocardiography. A diagnosis of the double-chambered right ventricle was made. The patient was offered surgery to fix the anomalous tissue but he refused. He did agree to subcutaneous implantable cardioverter-defibrillator placement and was then discharged home.

Abstract: Tamoxifen causing an increase in the anticoagulation effect of warfarin is suggested to be clinically significant, but cases so far have been largely undocumented. Current recommendations advise clinicians to proceed with caution during concomitant therapy. In the presence of other medications known to interact with warfarin, such as antibiotics, proton pump inhibitors, amiodarone, and azole antifungals, international normalized ratio (INR) elevations can possibly be exacerbated even further. We hereby present a case report and a review of significant literature on the use of tamoxifen and warfarin concurrently.

Abstract: Total thyroidectomy can be challenging in high-risk patients. Local cervical anesthesia with sedation is an alternative to general anesthesia.
A 33-year old male patient with cyanotic congenital heart disease due to unrepaired tricuspid atresia type Ic and associated pulmonary arterial hypertension presented with tachycardic atrial fibrillation and amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis resulting in recurrent hemodynamic instability. Because of difficulties controlling the thyrotoxic state, the indication for total thyroidectomy was established. Total thyroidectomy was subsequently performed using local anesthesia combined using a hypnosis-analgesia technique instead of intravenous sedation. The intervention and the post-operative course were uneventful.
A well-established therapist-patient relationship is crucial for a successful induction of hypnosis. Patient motivation and expectations are equally important for a successful implementation of this approach.
We conclude that hypnosis combined with local anesthesia provides an effective alternative in selected patients with very high anesthesiological risk.

Abstract: To describe the case of a man who developed amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) after a total thyroidectomy for metastatic follicular thyroid cancer because of the effect of the drug on metastasis. To the best of our knowledge this is the first reported case of this condition.
We completed a retrospective review of medical records and laboratory results including thyroid function tests as well as imaging reports including plain radiographs, positron emission tomographs, computed tomographs, and histology reports.
A 78-year-old man had undergone a total thyroidectomy for follicular thyroid cancer. He had meta-static disease in his chest and vertebrae, and after the operation he was started on suppressive levothyroxine treatment prior to ablative radioactive iodine treatment. Prior to thyroidectomy, his thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentration was 3.21 mU/L (reference range is 0.35 to 3.50 mU/L). On suppressive thyroxine replacement, his TSH concentration was 0.02 mU/L, his free thyroxine was 13 pmol/L (reference range is 8 to 12 pmol/L), and free triiodothyronine was 5.8 pmol/L (reference range is 3.8 to 6.0 pmol/L). He subsequently had a myocardial infarction and required antiarrhythmic treatment with amiodarone. Eleven days later he developed the clinical and biochemical features of thyrotoxicosis (TSH <0.01 mU/L, free thyroxine of 41 pmol/L, and free triiodothyronine of 14.7 pmol/L). His thyroxine dose was reduced and then discontinued 3 days later. AIT was the principal differential diagnosis, but before being able to determine the nature of the condition he died 18 days after his myocardial infarction.
AIT can still occur after total thyroidectomy if metastatic tissue is present.

Abstract: Cardiac arrest in an event of acute myocardial infarction most commonly results in life-threatening ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation (VF). Patients who remain in VF despite optimal epinephrine, amiodarone, and three or more attempts at 200 joules of biphasic current defibrillation are known to be in an electrical storm. Here, we describe a case of defibrillation refractory VF responding to intravenous esmolol resulting in a successful return of spontaneous circulation.

Abstract: Amiodarone is a class III antiarrhythmic agent that inhibits adrenergic stimulation by blocking alpha and beta receptors. It prolongs action potential and refractory period in myocardial tissue. Its remarkably long half-life is associated with a myriad of adverse events. Here, we present an 85-year-old male patient who was started on amiodarone for atrial flutter. After three oral doses, he developed fulminant hepatic failure and acute renal failure, which resolved after stopping amiodarone. While fulminant hepatic failure is rare, it has been seen in less than 2% of patients. Alternative theories behind susceptibility to amiodarone-induced hepatic injury and acute kidney injury are discussed here.

Abstract: This is the case of a 92-year-old female who was hospitalized one month prior to admission for symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, requiring intravenous amiodarone. Following her previous admission, she was placed on one month of amiodarone 200 mg twice daily, with a one week transition to 200 mg daily. The patient subsequently developed progressive shortness of breath and dry cough over a period of several weeks. Initial imaging showed diffuse bilateral coarse patchy interstitial infiltration on chest X-ray and bibasilar pleural effusions and scattered bilateral opacities on CTA chest. In an elderly patient presenting with dyspnea and dry cough, as well as interstitial opacities on imaging, amiodarone pulmonary toxicity should be considered despite short-term low-dose use.

Abstract: To describe the successful management of ventricular fibrillation (VF) and ventricular tachycardia (VT) using cardiopulmonary resuscitation, including defibrillation, followed by continuous rate infusion of IV amiodarone, in a cat with cardiac arrest secondary to tachyarrhythmia.
A 12-year-old previously healthy neutered male Scottish Fold cat presented following an acute episode of collapse. Initial physical examination revealed severe tachycardia and cardiovascular collapse. Within a few minutes after arrival, the cat experienced cardiopulmonary arrest. Electrocardiographic assessment was suggestive of VF, and CPR was initiated, including 2 rounds of defibrillation (2 joule/kg each), resulting in return of spontaneous circulation with sustained VT. After procainamide and lidocaine failed to result in conversion to normal sinus rhythm (NSR), continuous IV amiodarone therapy was initiated, and NSR was achieved. Echocardiography demonstrated severe systolic dysfunction, and tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy (TICM) secondary to chronic VT was suspected; however, dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) or end-stage hypertrophic cardiomyopathy could not be ruled out. The patient was discharged the following day with oral amiodarone and pimobendan. During a recheck examination performed 7 months later the cat was in NSR, with no direct evidence of long-term amiodarone adverse effects. The cat died acutely at home 8 months after discharge.
This report is the first to describe the successful use of IV amiodarone in a cat to manage sustained VT following CPR.

Abstract: Prolongation of the QT interval by antiarrhythmic drugs is the primary cause of torsade de pointes. Although there are previous reports of drug-induced torsade de pointes in patients undergoing hemodialysis, torsade de pointes caused by a sudden decrease of potassium levels in patients initiating hemodialysis has not been well described. A 70-year-old woman with recurrent bilateral gluteal abscesses visited the hospital for antibiotic treatment. Twenty-eight days after admission, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rhythm was newly detected and was controlled with intravenous amiodarone treatment. After developing pulmonary edema that did not improve with diuretic treatment, she underwent emergency hemodialysis. During hemodialysis, serum potassium and magnesium levels decreased to 3.1 and 1.7 mg/dL, respectively. The electrocardiogram showed torsade de pointes. Amiodarone treatment was stopped, and magnesium sulfate was infused. A higher concentration of potassium dialysate was used in continuous renal replacement therapy. Torsade de pointes episodes halted, and QT interval prolongation normalized. We describe a case with a rare complication of torsade de pointes upon initiating hemodialysis in a patient with QT prolongation. When initiating hemodialysis, serum potassium levels as well as electrocardiograms should be monitored in patients with a prolonged QT interval.

Abstract: Atrial flutter (AFL) is an uncommon arrhythmia in the pediatric population. It is defined as fast ordered atrial depolarization (about 250-500 beats/min). It occurs mainly in children with congenital heart defects; however, it may also manifest in fetuses and infants with an anatomically healthy heart. In neonates, AFL is most often revealed within the first 2 days after birth.
In this case report, we present 3 neonates without complex congenital heart defects with AFL, along with the description of the course, diagnostic and therapeutic processes depending on the clinical condition of a child, and response to treatment.
Symptoms in this group of patients are nonspecific, that is, tachypnea, unwillingness to eat, and fatigue while feeding. The diagnostic process included thorough electro- and echocardiographic assessments. Each child was treated individually due to a different cause of arrhythmia and comorbidities.
Invasive (electrical cardioversion) and pharmacological methods were used in treatment to achieve conversion to sinus rhythm.
One patient required electrical cardioversion, one was treated with amiodarone and digoxin, and one infant received amiodarone. All children achieved conversion to sinus rhythm.
During the follow-up, each child maintained sinus rhythm, which shows that in the neonatal group, it is a unique, but well-controlled, arrhythmia once conversion to sinus rhythm is achieved.

Abstract: Mucormycosis is a rare fungal infection occurring in the immunocompromised host. It is difficult to diagnose, and its cardiac involvement is extremely rare. Here, we report a 64-year-old Japanese man with a 5-year history of hemodialysis with disseminated mucormycosis causing fulminant myocarditis and pulmonary necrosis under glucocorticoid use. Two months before, he had received an implantable cardioverter defibrillator and started to take amiodarone for recurrent ventricular arrhythmias due to hypertensive cardiomyopathy. He developed amiodarone-induced interstitial pneumonia and then received glucocorticoid therapy. Although the interstitial pneumonia partially improved, a lung cavitary lesion developed in the upper right lobe. Antibiotics had no effect, and serologic tests, blood and sputum cultures and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were all negative for infectious pathogens. Eventually, he died of fulminant myocarditis. Autopsy revealed disseminated mucormycosis with vascular invasion and fungal thrombi, hemorrhage and infarction in lung (cavity lesion), heart (severe myocarditis), brain, thyroid and subcutaneous tissue around the implantable cardioverter defibrillator. The lung cavitary lesion was the only clinical finding suggestive of mucormycosis before autopsy. When an immunocompromised patient shows a progressive lung cavity lesion, the possibility of mucormycosis should be considered so that a broad-spectrum antifungal agent can be empirically administered in a timely fashion.

Abstract: Antiarrhythmic drugs are often the last resort for recurrent ventricular tachycardia refractory to catheter ablation in implantable cardioverter-defibrillator carriers. Amiodarone, alone or combined with mexiletine, is usually but not always highly effective, and its use is usually limited by systemic adverse effects. We present the case of a 62 years old man with recurrent ICD shocks due to a VT refractory to an endo-epicardial hybrid ablation. Starting of dronedarone plus mexiletine combination showed an excellent result.

Abstract: We report the case of an 88-year old woman referred for evaluation of increased INR. Surprisingly supratherapeutic levels of rivaroxaban was detected. Upon scrutiny of the patient's medical history, a drug-drug interaction between amiodarone and rivaroxaban persisting 3 weeks after cessation of amiodaron remains the prime suspect causing the clinical picture. Both INR and rivaroxaban levels returned to normal within 3 days of cessation of rivaroxaban. The case highlights that rivaroxaban, although highly variably, does affect INR. Furthermore, it highlights that the potential for DDIs involving amiodarone may persists for weeks or months after discontinuation. Amiodarone is predicted to increase rivaroxaban exposure, through inhibition of rivaroxaban elimination via CYP3A4 and P-gp. Elderly patients and patients with declining renal function are especially at risk of increased rivaroxaban exposure when a DDI with amiodarone occurs.

Abstract: Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) are currently used as destination therapy or bridge to heart transplantation in patients with advanced chronic heart failure (CHF). It has been proved to reduce mortality and symptoms in these patients. Patients with advanced CHF are known to have increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias (ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation (VF)) despite the presence of LVAD. We report the case of patients with ongoing VF during LVAD treatment while being awake and aware. We discuss the challenges introduced along with the increasing use of LVAD treatment. The decision whether a patient with LVAD automatically should have an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator is challenging. Randomised trials are warranted to shed light on these challenging decisions.

Abstract: Right atrial aneurysm (RAA) is a rare congenital heart disease (CHD) that usually shows no symptom and is discovered occasionally. This paper introduces the clinical and imaging data obtained in 2 RAA patients and presents a related literature review with the aim of increasing understanding of this disease.
One case showed chest distress, while the other showed symptoms on physical examination and positive signs.
Both of these 2 cases were diagnosed with RAA based on ultrasonography, computed tomography angiography (CTA), and enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations.
One patient was orally administered warfarin anticoagulant therapy, while the other was given amiodarone to control arrhythmia as well as warfarin anticoagulant therapy.
The clinical symptoms of both cases were not aggravated.
RAA is a rare cardiac anomaly that can induce severe complications, and it is mainly diagnosed based on imaging examinations. Conservative treatment and regular imaging monitoring are recommended for asymptomatic patients with no high-risk factors, while surgical treatment should be performed in symptomatic patients with high-risk factors.

Abstract: Myocarditis is an uncommon but potentially life-threatening disease. Clinical manifestations could range from subclinical disease to sudden death, due to fulminant heart failure and/or malignant ventricular arrhythmias. The most common cause of myocarditis is viral infection, including Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Nevertheless, EBV rarely presents with cardiac involvement in immunocompetent hosts. We report a case of acute EBV-related myocarditis in a young female, complicated with malignant ventricular arrhythmias and cardiac arrest. After 20 days of hospitalization and treatment, the patient was fit for discharge on pharmacological therapy (tapering steroids, beta-blockers, amiodarone, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and diuretics). Clinical course is described, cardiac magnetic resonance images are shown. This case underlines how myocarditis is a disease that should not be underestimated: it could present with life-threatening complications such as malignant arrhythmias and/or severe systolic dysfunction. <

Abstract: Amiodarone is a lipophilic structure with a half-life of 25-100 days. Long-term oral amiodarone is associated with photosensitivity, thyroid dysfunction, and pulmonary and hepatic toxicity. Intravenous amiodarone can lead to sweating, heating sensation, nausea, phlebitis at the injection site, and rarely acute hepatitis. This is a compelling case of a 60-year-old male who developed acute liver injury 24-36 h after starting amiodarone. All the possible causes of acute liver injury were ruled out, and his liver enzymes improved after discontinuing amiodarone.

Abstract: The subcutaneous implantable cardioverter defibrillator (S-ICD) is an alternative to the transvenous implantable cardioverter defibrillator for the prevention of sudden cardiac death. Here, we report a rare case of refractoriness to an S-ICD after frequent therapies for ventricular fibrillation (VF) storms.
A 24-year-old man underwent a bout of syncope with vomiting and incontinence at home. He was brought to the emergency room and was witnessed to spontaneously go into VF successfully converted by external defibrillation. Previously, he was diagnosed with a type I Brugada electrocardiogram pattern by a pilsicainide administration test in another hospital. Although he had a family history of sudden cardiac death in 3 relatives, including his brother, he was followed closely without any therapies because he had never had an episode of syncope. He was implanted with an S-ICD without any trouble. Seven months later, frequent S-ICD shocks for VF storms occurred. His VF was controlled by using intravenous amiodarone, which was converted to an oral preparation. However, his VF recurred after another 2 months. The analysis of his S-ICD data revealed that 4 consecutive shock deliveries could not terminate his VF and the final shock delivered could fortunately terminate it because of a high defibrillation threshold test (DFT) due to an increasing shock impedance (64 to 90 Ω). First, we performed an epicardial Brugada syndrome ablation and subsequently replaced and repositioned the S-ICD lead from a left to a right parasternal site. After the re-implantation of the S-ICD, the DFT test improved to within normal range. According to the pathological analysis, infiltration of inflammatory cells and extensive fibrosis were confirmed in the subcutaneous tissue around the shock lead and S-ICD body.
Frequent S-ICD shocks for VF storms might cause various pathological changes around the device and lead to a high DFT.

Abstract: Vaping-associated lung injury has rapidly become a nationwide epidemic and a threat to public health. In this case series, we describe unique clinical features of severe vaping-associated lung injury, defined as respiratory failure due to vaping that requires mechanical ventilation.
Clinical observation of four patients.
Case series.
Data and images were extract from medical records after approval was obtained from the institutional review board.
Four patients were admitted to the ICU with severe manifestation of vaping-associated lung injury. Although every case required mechanical ventilatory support (venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in one patient), all patients survived and were discharged without supplemental oxygen. Systemic corticosteroids were administered in three patients and N-acetyl cysteine in one. A postdischarge pulmonary function test in one patient was normal except for mildly decreased diffusing capacity.
Based on our experience, prognosis of severe vaping-associated lung injury appears favorable with aggressive supportive care, although there is evidence from existing literature that mortality rate might rise with increasing disease severity. Underlying mechanism of lung injury might be similar between vaping-associated lung injury and amiodarone pneumonitis. Foamy or lipid-laden macrophages, seen in both conditions, might be a marker of cytotoxicity from substances contained in e-cigarettes, such as vitamin E acetate. Systemic corticosteroids, and possibly N-acetyl cysteine, could be considered as therapeutic adjuncts in vaping-associated lung injury. Serial pulmonary function tests should be obtained in these patients to monitor for potential long-term complications. The primary limitations of this case series are its small sample and lack of longitudinal follow-up data.

Abstract: Drug-induced lupus erythematosus has features distinct from primary systemic lupus erythematosus. It can occur with a wide variety of agents that result in the generation of anti-histone or other types of antibodies. Systemic manifestations of drug-induced systemic lupus erythematosus may include renal dysfunction due to circulating immune complexes or due to other immune reactions to the culprit medication(s). Acute interstitial nephritis occurs due to DNA-drug or protein-drug complexes that trigger an allergic immune response. We report a patient who developed acute kidney injury, rash, and drug-induced systemic lupus diagnosed by serologies after starting chlorthalidone and amiodarone. A renal biopsy showed acute interstitial nephritis and not lupus-induced glomerulonephritis. It is important to note that systemic lupus erythematosus and acute interstitial nephritis can occur together, and this report highlights the role of the kidney biopsy in ascertaining the pathological diagnosis and outlining therapy in drug-induced lupus erythematosus.

Abstract: Hepatotoxicity caused by chronic oral amiodarone is well documented with around 15-20% incidence rate. However, acute liver failure due to intravenous (IV) amiodarone is rare clinical presentation with 3% incidence rate. Incidence of concomitant renal failure is even rarer. There is no full explanation for the underlying mechanism. Herein, we are presenting a rare case of concomitant acute hepatic failure and acute-on-chronic renal injury induced by use of IV amiodarone. A 67-year-old man with past medical history of coronary artery disease s/p coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), history of alcoholism, and chronic kidney disease stage 3 presented with chest pain for 1 week. In the emergency department (ED), he was found to have atrial flutter. Due to unresponsiveness to IV β-blocker and diltiazem, the patient was loaded with IV amiodarone and continued IV amiodarone drip. His liver function tests (LFTs) and renal functions at the time of administration of IV amiodarone were aspartate transaminase (AST) 176 (10 - 42 IU/L) and alanine transaminase (ALT) 208 (10 - 60 IU/L), international normalized ratio (INR) 1.39 (reference value 2 - 3), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 37 (5 - 25 mg/dL), and creatinine 1.85. Sixteen hours later patient developed acute hepatic failure with AST 4,250 (reference value 10 - 42 IU/L), ALT 2,422 (10 - 60 IU/L), INR 2.28, and acute renal failure with creatinine of 3.2 mg/dL (0.44 - 1.0 mg/dL), and BUN of 44 mg/d (5 - 25 mg/dL). Patient was intubated due to acute hepatic encephalopathy and sent to intensive care unit (ICU). IV amiodarone was stopped immediately. All workup for other causes of acute hepatic failure came back negative. He was started on IV N-acetylcysteine and required hemodialysis for acute-on-chronic renal failure. LFTs peaked 72 h after discontinuation of amiodarone. Kidney functions started to improve 5 days after discontinuation of amiodarone and patient came off hemodialysis. Acute hepatic failure as result of IV amiodarone is a rare presentation; however, it has a high mortality. Risk factors include low ejection fraction, hepatic congestion and pre-existing hepatic dysfunction. No obvious underlying mechanism to this presentation has been fully explained. Acute renal failure can be associated with this presentation which is even rarer. Stopping IV amiodarone, administering N-acetylcysteine and good supportive care can lead to favorable outcome.

Abstract: Lacosamide (LCM) is a well-tolerated and increasingly used second-generation AED, and side effects such as atrial fibrillation are rare and poorly characterized. Supported by a literature review, we share our experience of the management of the first reported case of cardioembolic cerebral infarcts in the context of de novo atrial fibrillation, which appeared following a 200-mg intravenous infusion of LCM for the treatment of non-convulsive status epilepticus. Case report and literature review using search items including "atrial fibrillation OR atrial flutter AND LCM" in the thesaurus of Medline. We found three cases of atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter secondary to LCM, one following a 200-mg intravenous infusion. In one patient, previous risk factors for atrial fibrillation were reported and another was started on warfarin; all required suspension of LCM for cessation of atrial fibrillation. Previous risk factors for atrial fibrillation in our patient were older age, male gender, obesity, hypertension, valvular disease, first-degree atrioventricular block and left anterior fascicle block. Atrial fibrillation appeared at the end of the infusion and ceased after a loading dose of amiodarone and suspension of LCM. Apixaban was initiated indefinitely five days later, and MRI showed four acute silent infarctions. The appearance of atrial fibrillation has severe therapeutic and clinical implications and the use of LCM might be reconsidered within a context of increased predisposition to developing atrial fibrillation. If atrial fibrillation appears, the drug should be discontinued and anticoagulation should be considered according to embolic risk. Further investigation is needed in order to better categorize the risk profile of lacosamide regarding atrial fibrillation.

Abstract: Chronic Chagas heart disease has different clinical manifestations including arrhythmias, heart failure, and stroke. Chest pain is one of the most common symptoms and when associated with changes in the electrocardiogram, such as T-wave changes, electrically inactive areas, and segmental wall motion abnormalities, may lead to a misdiagnosis of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Here, we describe two patients with Chagas heart disease and syncope due to sustained ventricular tachycardia who were misdiagnosed with ACS, and discuss the role of novel imaging modalities in the differential diagnosis and risk stratification.

Abstract: The residual renal function (RRF) in a peritoneal dialysis (PD) patient is clinically important because it contributes to dialytic adequacy, quality of life and mortality. We present the case of a patient in PD with a marked decrease in RRF. Even after the increase of dialysis, the patient maintained asthenia and anorexia, was prostrate and showed no improvement analytically. The study revealed hypothyroidism, iatrogenic due to the use of amiodarone. After suspension of the drug and replacement with levothyroxine, there was a normalization of thyroid function and recovery of RRF to baseline values. A thyroid dysfunction is associated with several changes in renal function, in most cases reversible after obtaining euthyroid state. The association between thyroid dysfunction and loss of RRF continues to be under-recognized. We should consider monitoring thyroid function annually as routine in this group of patients.

Abstract: BACKGROUND Amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis can be refractory to medical treatment seldom requiring surgical intervention. Herewith, we present the first case to date of amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis in a congenital heart disease post-Senning procedure requiring emergent surgical management. CASE REPORT A 19-year-old-male patient with a history of a complex congenital heart disease developed severe pulmonary baffle stenosis and atrial fibrillation that was medically treated with amiodarone, upon which he developed. Amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis that was refractory to medical treatment. The patient was taken to the operating room for surgical treatment of his refractory disease. An intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography was employed ensuring adequate monitoring of his systemic vascular resistance and pulmonary arterial pressures. CONCLUSIONS Because of the high risk of cardiac complications induced by thyroid-induced thyrotoxicosis, patients with complex congenital heart disease require careful intraoperative monitoring in anticipation of tragic events. This is a report of a single case of successful operation on a patient in the thyrotoxic state.

Abstract: Özsoylu S, Akyıldız BN, Dursun A, Pamukçu Ö. Could you say that was an atrial flutter or not? Turk J Pediatr 2019; 61: 608-610. Muscle-tremor artefact is a potential cause of misdiagnosis of atrial arrhythmias on electrocardiography (ECG) monitoring. Such errors may lead to inappropriate and potentially dangerous therapies in some patients. We present a case of a patient with uncontrolled seizures whose bedside electrocardiogram monitor analysis appeared to demonstrate atrial flutter with 4:1 conduction through the AV node. The ECG monitor and ECG rhythm strip additionally showed a regular ventricular rate of 94 bpm with an underlying regular `saw-tooth` baseline. We applied cardioversion to convert to sinus rhythm. Amiodarone was loaded and added to the patients therapy who had atrial flutter after cardioversion. Echocardiogram was performed by a pediatric cardiologist and they noted that the atrial rate and ventricular rate were equal. After this, we began to suspect this situation might be a pseudoflutter due to his muscle contractions. We applied rocuronium to the patient to understand whether this was a pseudo-flutter or not. We saw that the ECG returned to normal sinus rhythm. Physicians especially working in intensive care units should be aware of artifact to avoid unnecessary therapeutic procedures. As Hippocrates said centuries ago `First, do no harm.`.

Abstract: This case involves a 55-year-old male patient with systolic heart failure and refractory atrial fibrillation due to thyrotoxicosis, who was electrically cardioverted but then developed torsade de pointes and ventricular fibrillation. Rate control was unsuccessful with digoxin, cardizem, labetalol, esmolol and amiodorone. Patient was externally cardioverted after which ECGs showed prolonged QT with frequent premature ventricular contractions. ECGs also showed 'R-on-T' phenomenon leading to torsades and ventricular fibrillation. Atrial overdrive pacing was used to terminate the dangerous arrhythmia and the patient returned to sinus rhythm. Interestingly, he was found to have new onset thyrotoxicosis and started on methimazole.

Abstract: Bidirectional ventricular tachycardia (BVT) is a rare arrhythmia characterized by QRS complexes with an axis in the frontal plane alternating polarity in the precordial leads and right bundle branch block (RBBB) morphology. To the best of our knowledge, there is no previous report in dilated cardiomyopathy or in the context of a probable peripartum cardiomyopathy.
A 26-year-old, 9-month female patient, with no significant past medical history (the patient denies medication intake, herbs like aconite, trouble during delivery, any heart issues or family history of sudden death or cardiomyopathies) who presents to the emergency room due to 11 days of dyspnea, exacerbated by daily activities, orthopnea, and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. She presented with ventricular bigeminy and systolic dysfunction with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <20%. The patient later developed a stable ventricular tachycardia (VT) treated with amiodarone, which resulted in hemodynamic instability and BVT rhythm with VT paroxysms. Without the possibility of ablation, the use of high dose beta blockers and an implantable cardioverter defibrillator resulted in the same rhythm with a lower heart rate, better NYHA functional class, and less episodes of VTs.
BVT is a rare type of tachycardia that can be present in dilated cardiomyopathy. In the absence of ablation capabilities, decreasing the heart rate with beta-blockers may reduce the rate of paroxysmal VTs.

Abstract: Herbal products have been used for therapeutic purposes for a long time. However, many herbs can be toxic and even life-threatening. If refractory ventricular tachycardia (VT) is caused by herbal products and shows no response to conventional therapy, intravenous lipid emulsion (ILE) therapy can be considered. We report a case of herbal intoxication leading to refractory VT, which was successfully treated with ILE therapy. A 36-year-old woman with aplastic anemia presented with mental changes. She had taken an unknown herbal decoction three days before visiting the hospital. Soon after coming to the hospital, she went into cardiac arrest. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed, and return of spontaneous circulation with VT was achieved. Synchronized cardioversion was then performed and amiodarone was administered. However, VT with pulse continued, so ILE therapy was attempted, which led to the resolution of VT.

Abstract: A 76-year-old woman with permanent atrial fibrillation and a mechanical aortic valve came to our attention. Echocardiography showed a 50-55% ejection fraction (EF) with good prosthesis performance. For symptomatic bradyarrhythmia, she received a VVI pacemaker (Proponent MRI L2010 model; Boston Scientific.). During follow-up, frequent symptomatic (presyncopal) episodes of nonsustained episodes of ventricular tachycardia (VT) were detected. Amiodarone proved unsuccessful; she was then offered an upgrade to an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) and a subcutaneous ICD (S-ICD) was chosen by the patient. A few weeks later, two sustained VT were detected and effectively treated with 80-J shock delivery. In both cases, device interrogation revealed a VT rate around 163 bpm (370 ms cycle length), below the lowest device detection cutoff. The report is a case-based review.

Abstract: Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis (TPP) is a potentially fatal complication of hyperthyroidism, characterized by recurrent muscle paralysis and hypokalemia. We present a case of a 32-year-old apparently healthy male patient, who presented with acute paraparesis associated with hypokalemia (K: 1.6 mmol/L), complicated by ventricular tachycardia (VT). Advanced cardiac life support was initiated with an amiodarone infusion, and eventually QRS complex narrowed and wide complex tachycardia resolved. Intravenous potassium chloride (KCl) 40 mEq over 2-3 h and oral KCL 40 mEq were administered to treat the electrolyte imbalance. Patient paralysis was quickly reversed; motor function was regained with movement of the lower extremities. This case highlights the importance of early recognition and prompt treatment of TPP as a differential diagnosis for muscle weakness, especially in the setting of severe hypokalemia. It is important to pay attention to the possibility of the development of lethal VT associated with hypokalemia in the setting of hyperthyroidism and thyrotoxic paralysis.

Abstract: Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP), also known as extrinsic allergic alveolitis, is a granulomatous, non-IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reaction of the alveoli and distal bronchioles presenting as an acute, subacute or chronic condition. It is most commonly associated with exposure to extrinsic allergens (eg, avian dust, mould and tobacco) and medications including antiarrhythmics (eg, amiodarone), cytotoxics (eg, methotrexate) and antiepileptics (eg, carbamazepine). Individuals diagnosed with this condition can present with severe hypoxia and respiratory failure. The fundamental principle of management is to remove the causative allergen. Evidence implicating selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors as a causative agent is limited, and this case report describes a rare clinical presentation of HP associated with sertraline, how it was diagnosed and subsequently treated. It is anticipated that raising awareness of this interaction will assist multidisciplinary teams, managing patients diagnosed with HP, to be more cognisant of sertraline as being an aetiological factor for this condition.

Abstract: Infective endocarditis (IE) is defined as an infection of the endocardial surface of the heart, which may include one or more heart valves, the mural endocardium.
A 53-years-old man with a history of alcohol abuse was admitted in hospital for fever, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation cardioverted by Amiodarone and pulmonary infection.
A case of recurrent severe endocarditis, with neurological complications both ischemic and hemorrhagic and heart failure caused by Streptococcus agalactiae in healthy man we reported.
Surgery was performed 2 weeks after admission.
The onset of intracranial hemorrhage delayed second cardiac surgery and the patient died because of end-stage heart failure.
Infective endocarditis caused by S. agalactiae is very rare, particularly in patients without underlying structural heart disease. This study showed that IE due to S. Agalactiae is a disease with high mortality when associated with neurological complication, heart failure but especially when it is recurrent and hits valve prosthesis.

Abstract: Amiodarone is an anti-arrhythmic drug widely used, but its administration can be associated with several adverse side-effects. Among these, amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity (APT) occurs in 4-17% of cases and, if not early diagnosed and treated, may evolve towards pulmonary fibrosis and respiratory failure. A 76 years-old-man went to the hospital for accidental trauma. The patient did not report respiratory symptoms but was suffering from atrial fibrillation treated with amiodarone 200 mg/day from three years (cumulative dose >150 gr). HRCT showed ground-glass opacities and nodules in both lungs. The patient underwent fibreoptic bronchoscopy with BAL. Cytologic examination of BALF sediment put in evidence foamy macrophages. The electronic microscopy revealed into the alveolar macrophages "… the presence of multilamellar intracytoplasmic bodies and lysosomes, loads of lipid material". LFTs showed a restrictive syndrome and an impairment of DLCO. Amiodarone discontinuation and steroid administration led to the regression of radiological lesions and the recovery of lung function. Patients taking amiodarone can experience APT. They should perform a basal chest x-ray with LFTs before starting therapy. Monitoring could reveal early the pulmonary toxicity, and patients can respond favourably to the treatment.

Abstract: Permanent His bundle pacing (HBP) activates the ventricles through the normal conduction system and has become a useful technique for patients with a high ventricular pacing rate. Presently described is a case of drug-refractory atrial fibrillation (AF) with a high ventricular rate that was treated with atrioventricular (AV) node ablation and permanent HBP. A 62-year-old woman with persistent AF and a drug-refractory high ventricular response was referred for exercise intolerance and palpitation. She had a history of failed catheter ablation attempts and amiodarone toxicity. Permanent HBP and AV node ablation was planned to achieve rate control with a stepwise approach. Initially, implantation of a permanent pacemaker was performed. The His lead and right ventricular back-up leads were implanted successfully, in the manner described previously. The His lead was connected to the atrial channel of the pacemaker battery and programmed to AAI pacing mode. The AV node was ablated successfully 3 weeks later without any threshold changes in the His lead. No His lead threshold changes were observed during or after AV node ablation and the patient was subsequently asymptomatic with twice daily apixaban 5 mg. Permanent HBP after AV node ablation can be a beneficial treatment option to prevent pacing-induced ventricular dyssynchrony and heart failure in patients who are not eligible for cardiac resynchronization therapy.

Abstract: This article reviews the pathogenesis, clinical features, and management of toxic myopathy related to common medications, critical illness, and illicit substances.
Muscle symptoms are common among statin users and are usually reversible after discontinuation of the statin; rarely, however, statins trigger an immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy that persists and requires immunomodulatory therapy. Autoantibodies targeting 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase can distinguish the toxic and immune-mediated forms. Immune checkpoint inhibitors, increasingly used in the treatment of advanced cancer, have recently been associated with the development of inflammatory myositis. A reversible mitochondrial myopathy has long been associated with zidovudine, but recent reports elucidate the risk of myopathy with newer antivirals, such as telbivudine and raltegravir.
The medications most commonly associated with myopathy include statins, amiodarone, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, colchicine, certain antivirals, and corticosteroids, and myopathy can occur with chronic alcoholism. Certain clinical, electrodiagnostic, and histologic features can aid in early recognition. Stopping the use of the offending agent reverses symptoms in most cases, but specific and timely treatment may be required in cases related to agents that trigger immune-mediated muscle injury.

Abstract: Amiodarone is a common antiarrhythmic medication used in daily practice with excellent efficiency. While it has many benefits, there are several common adverse reactions, such as abnormal thyroid function and cornea verticillata, associated with its use. A much less common adverse reaction is the so-called "Blue man syndrome," occurring in 1-3% of patients. Blue man syndrome is thought to stem from the deposition of lysosomal membrane-bound dense bodies, similar to lipofuscin, in the dermis of patients on chronic amiodarone therapy. We present the case of a 77-year-old male who presented to us post-cardiac arrest secondary to hyperkalemia of 7.0. Although it was noted in the patient's chart that he had an "allergy" to amiodarone (it was noted in his chart it only turned his leg black), it was used in the emergency department because of the failure of other antiarrhythmics to treat his arrhythmia and all other medical options were exhausted. It was decided that the benefits of using amiodarone far outweighed the risks of it. Ultimately it was found that the patient did not have a true allergy to amiodarone, but suffered from a known benign adverse effect of the drug resulting in a greyish-blue tinge to his bilateral lower extremities. His-presentation differs from the normal presentation of blue man syndrome which appears more commonly on sun-exposed areas of the body such as the face and arms. While this is a benign adverse effect of amiodarone, it can be very distressing to patients and must be addressed.

Abstract: Myxedema coma is a rare complication of hypothyroidism. Clinical examination may reveal hypotension, bradycardia, and hypothermia. Laboratory tests may show hyponatremia, lipid disorders, and elevations of creatine kinase, liver, and cardiac enzymes. We describe four cases diagnosed in our hospital during the period 1999-2017. The patients were related to amiodarone treatment, noncompliance with hormone replacement therapy, or a new diagnosis of hypothyroidism. Intravenous hormone replacement therapy was effective in three of the cases and one died. The outcome of this disease may be fatal as seen in one of our cases.

Abstract: Dronedarone is a class III antiarrhythmic agent and a potent blocker of multiple intracardiac ion channels with many electrophysical properties common with amiodarone. Oral dronedarone, 400 mg twice daily, is approved for the maintenance of normal sinus rhythm in patients with a history of atrial fibrillation (AF) or atrial flutter. It is primarily used for the maintenance of sinus rhythm in patients with paroxysmal or persistent AF or atrial flutter. Dronedarone is a relatively new therapeutic agent which is a non-iodinated congener of amiodarone and hypothesized to have far lesser side effects. Photosensitivity is an uncommon side effect of dronedarone and not much has been described in the literature. Here we describe a patient with such complication.

Abstract: Stellate Ganglion Block (SGB) provides a blockade of sympathetic signals from the sympathetic chain and appears to be a promising method of controlling refractory ventricular arrhythmias, but there are scanty data in the literature.
Herein, we describe a 59-year-old male patient with a history of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy and suffering from frequent VT episodes, who received ICD implantation and regular amiodarone medication control.
Monomorphic VT refractory to standard medication control and focal extensive catheter ablation.
Left Stellate Ganglion Block (LSGB) was performed under ultrasound-assisted injection at the C6 level using a 10 ml solution of 0.4% lidocaine and 0.5% bupivacaine.
In our case, refractory VT subsided and sinus rhythm was retained immediately after LSGB. There were no VT episodes for at least 3 hours during the inter-hospital transfer, which did not involve any specific complications.
LSGB may provide effective VT control and play an important role in rescue and bridge therapy before catheter ablation.

Abstract: Thyroid storm is a severe manifestation of thyrotoxicosis and can present with multiorgan failure. First line treatment of thyroid storm is directed towards decreasing thyroid hormone production and peripheral conversion of T4 to T3, and treating adrenergic symptoms. When medical therapy fails, plasmapheresis is an alternative treatment option. Here we present a patient with thyroid storm and multiorgan failure who was treated with plasmapheresis.
A 50-year-old male with a history of hyperthyroidism, hypertension, and congestive heart failure presented to another hospital with fever and altered mentation. He was found to have pneumonia on imaging and was started on antibiotics. He developed shock complicated by atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate which was treated with amiodarone. He was transferred to our hospital for further management. On arrival, TSH was <0.01 mIU/L, free T4 was >7 ng/dL and total T3 was 358 ng/dL. The endocrinology team determined he was in thyroid storm. His medical treatment of thyroid storm was aggressively titrated to maximal therapy. His hospital course was complicated by transaminitis, respiratory failure requiring intubation, shock requiring vasopressor support, kidney failure requiring continuous renal replacement therapy, and heart failure. Despite maximal anti-thyroid therapy, he had not improved clinically and T4 and T3 remained markedly elevated. A 4-day course of plasmapheresis was initiated resulting in marked lowering of T4 and T3 and clinical stability.
While current guidelines for plasmapheresis for thyroid storm recommend individualized decision making, no further clarification is provided on who would be a good candidate for the procedure. We present a patient with thyroid storm and multiorgan failure who was treated with plasmapheresis after failing maximal medical therapy. Given the significant improvement seen with plasmapheresis, endocrinologists should consider this mode of treatment earlier in the course of thyroid storm when patients are not improving with medical therapy alone.

Abstract: Radiofrequency cathether ablation (RFCA) of Atrial Fibrillation (AFib) and typical atrial flutter (AF) is traditionally performed via femoral vein approach and all devices are designed to be delivered via inferior access. In rare cases of congenital or iatrogenic obstruction of inferior vena cava (IVC), RFCA of arrhythmias is performed via transhepatic approach.
87 year old male patient with history of IVC filter placement for recurrent deep venous thrombosis and AFib on amiodarone developed symptoms with worsening Afib burden resulting in deterioration of left ventricular ejection fraction.Due to highly symptomatic pharmacological uncontrolled AFib, RFCA was decided in order to achieve long term success in restoring normal sinus rhythm. Transesophageal echocardiography on the day of procedure excluded clot or thrombus. Right femoral vein cannulation was performed, but advancing the guidewire through the IVC was extremely difficult. Peripheral venography revealed complete occlusion of the venous system with no flow through the IVC filter.We present you a case report of pulmonary vein isolation succesfully performed via the left subclavian vein.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report of the following: (a) successful transseptal puncture in a patient with persistent AFib and complete iatrogenic obstruction of the IVC using a Baylis wire through superior access without any complications, (b) PVI and typical AF ablation via superior approach using a bidirectional contact sensing ablation catheter; monitoring of the contact force in this case being extremely practical and (c) use of Vascade sheath for closure of the left axillary vein.

Abstract: A 4-year-old boy presented with intractable atrial tachycardia and heart failure. Antiarrhythmic drugs, such as digoxin, beta-blockers, and amiodarone were ineffective. Although we attempted multiple radiofrequency catheter ablations, the atrial tachycardia arising from left atrial appendage frequently recurred. Finally, we decided to perform atrial appendectomy using the thoracoscopic approach. Immediately after the appendectomy, the atrial tachycardia was terminated and restored to sinus rhythm. Left ventricular ejection fraction increased from 33 to 60% within 1 week. He had no arrhythmia during the subsequent 9-month follow-up period. Minimally invasive thoracoscopic surgery can be applied even in a small child who has focal atrial tachycardia originating from an atrial appendage.

Abstract: Sotalol is a class III anti-arrhythmic agent with beta receptor blocking properties. Intravenous (IV) sotalol may be useful to treat refractory atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. A report on the efficacy and safety of IV sotalol in an infant on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), who developed refractory ventricular arrhythmias following surgery for congenital heart disease. A 10-day old infant with severe pulmonary valve stenosis underwent surgical pulmonary valvectomy and enlargement of the main pulmonary artery. Post-operatively, the patient developed hemodynamically significant accelerated idioventricular rhythm which was not responsive to a combination of amiodarone, lidocaine, and procainamide leading to 2 cardiac arrest events and placement on ECMO. The amiodarone infusion was uptitrated to 20 mcg/kg/min, but episodes of the hemodynamically compromising arrhythmia continued. Amiodarone was discontinued and IV sotalol was initiated at 42 mg/m

Abstract: Amiodarone is an antiarrhythmic agent that is used commonly in clinical practice. It is associated with many side effects, the most common being pulmonary manifestations. Interstitial pneumonitis is one of the most common complications, however rarely amiodarone can cause diffuse alveolar haemorrhage (DAH) too. We describe the case of a 73-year-old woman who presented with shortness of breath and haemoptysis 4 days after starting amiodarone. She was diagnosed with amiodarone-induced DAH based on imaging and bronchoalveolar lavage. She was treated with intravenous and then oral steroids, and amiodarone was discontinued. The patient made a significant clinical and radiological recovery. She was discharged 10 days after her presentation. This case highlights a rare but potentially life-threatening complication of a commonly used medication.

Abstract: A 60-year-old patient presented with recalcitrant electrical storm (ES). Mild sedation and initial antiarrhythmic combination of esmolol and amiodarone did not affect the intensity of ES, which resulted in battery exhaustion. Oral propranolol in addition to intravenous amiodarone might be preferred in hemodynamically stable patients before interventional therapies. (

Abstract: Lipofuscin deposition is a characteristic manifestation of aging. There is very limited literature in humans and in animals describing these deposits in native kidneys. Overall, it is thought to be non-pathogenic and successful transplants from a donor with lipofuscin deposits have been reported. We present the case of a patient who underwent a kidney transplant and a for-cause biopsy post-transplantation incidentally revealed lipofuscin deposition.
A 48-year old gentleman with a past medical history of diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and ischemic and then hemorrhagic cardiovascular accident underwent a successful kidney transplant. His donor was an expanded criteria donor with no major past medical history. Post-transplant course was complicated by delayed graft function requiring one dialysis treatment for hyperkalemia. After that he had an uneventful course and achieved a baseline creatinine of 1.2 mg/dL, with no proteinuria. On a routine 19-month follow-up he was noted to have proteinuria and an antibody against the major-histocompatibility-complex class I-related chain A. A graft biopsy revealed acute antibody-mediated rejection and impressive lipofuscin deposition. He was subsequently treated with an antibody-mediated rejection protocol that included high dose steroids, Rituximab, plasmapheresis, and intravenous immunoglobulin, but responded poorly to this regimen. A 6-month follow up biopsy continued to show lipofuscin deposition, with similar microvascular injury scores and 12-months later his creatinine remained stable but his proteinuria worsened. Patient was struggling with recurrent infectious episodes requiring hospitalizations and thus no further diagnostic or therapeutic treatments were pursued.
Lipofuscin deposition has been reported in solid organ transplants but the significance and cause are not well understood. Several physiologic and some pathologic causes to these deposits have been reported including age, diabetes, medications and a genetic syndrome. We propose that immunologic causes such as rejection in the presence of other risk factors could potentiate the oxidative stress leading to excessive lipofuscin deposition in kidney transplants. In the case of our patient, we conclude that these deposits were likely recipient-derived, and postulate that the cumulative burden of inflammation from rejection, and underlying medical conditions led to increased lipofuscin deposition. We speculate them to be an innocent bystander.

Abstract: Amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity (APT) is one of the most feared and underappreciated adverse effects of this commonly prescribed antiarrhythmic. APT has a variable presentation, among the rarest of these is amiodarone-induced diffuse alveolar hemorrhage with hemoptysis. Though previous cases confirmed with biopsy averaged a dose of 570 mg PO daily, APT can occur at any dose. Previous literature has suggested the importance of cumulative exposure to amiodarone rather than the patient's actual dose. The presented case describes amiodarone-induced hemoptysis occurring at a dose of 200 mg PO daily for five years. Additionally described is the treatment regimen which managed a patient with metabolic syndrome and elevated A1c while addressing the recommended treatment of extended high-dose steroids for APT with complicated respiratory status. To the best of the authors' knowledge, only two biopsied cases have been described at a dose this low. Furthermore, this case describes a more typical timeline for APT than those two cases.

Abstract: Stellate ganglion blockade has been previously suggested as a treatment option for intractable ventricular arrhythmia; however, its use in emergency department management of pulseless arrest with shockable rhythm has not been described. We report the case of a 65-year-old man brought in by ambulance who complained of chest pain and received an out-of-hospital ECG suggestive of anterior-wall ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. Shortly after arrival, the patient became unresponsive, with no palpable pulse, and was found to be in ventricular fibrillation. The patient's ventricular fibrillation persisted despite repeated attempts at standard and double sequential defibrillation, multiple rounds of epinephrine, and amiodarone, magnesium, and bicarbonate. After these interventions were exhausted, a stellate ganglion blockade was conducted after an ultrasonographically guided paratracheal approach. Return of spontaneous circulation was noted after the next defibrillation and pulse check, achieved after a total of 42 minutes of active cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The patient ultimately had both sufficient neurologic activity and hemodynamic recovery for emergency percutaneous coronary intervention of the culprit left anterior descending artery. This positive outcome is multifactorial but suggests sympathetic blockade as a possible adjunctive therapy in the setting of sustained pulseless ventricular storm.

Abstract: Ergül Y, Öztürk E, Özgür S. Successful radiofrequency ablation of accessory pathway associated with left atrial appendage aneurysm in a low birthweight premature patient. Turk J Pediatr 2019; 61: 142-146. Tachyarrhythmias are common cardiac arrhythmias in newborns and infants. We present a premature case with a 2.4-kg birth weight, with non-immune hydrops due to supraventricular tachycardia. Despite the combination of amiodarone, esmolol and flecainide, tachyarrhythmia could not be controlled and radiofrequency ablation was applied due to left ventricular dysfunction. After the procedure the rhythm returned to normal sinus and left ventricular functions improved rapidly. The follow-up of the case continues without any problems. In this presentation, successful ablation of the accessory pathway associated with structural heart disease have been covered in the youngest and smallest patient to date.

Abstract: A patient with underlying Hashimoto's thyroiditis developed amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis type 1 that was successfully treated using methimazole in combination with potassium iodide. A 35-year-old woman admitted for perinatal care of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome was given amiodarone for 7 days for paroxysmal ventricular contraction following pulseless ventricular tachycardia 1 day after delivery. She developed thyrotoxicosis one month after the discontinuation of amiodarone therapy and was negative for thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor antibody. An increased peak velocity of the superior thyroid artery suggested amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis type 1.

Abstract: A patient with underlying Hashimoto's thyroiditis developed amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis type 1 that was successfully treated using methimazole in combination with potassium iodide. A 35-year-old woman admitted for perinatal care of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome was given amiodarone for 7 days for paroxysmal ventricular contraction following pulseless ventricular tachycardia 1 day after delivery. She developed thyrotoxicosis one month after the discontinuation of amiodarone therapy and was negative for thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor antibody. An increased peak velocity of the superior thyroid artery suggested amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis type 1. Her thyroid function recovered after combination therapy with methimazole and potassium iodide.

Abstract: Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is considered the standard of care for treatment of inoperable early stage non-small cell carcinoma of the lung. SBRT delivers a very high dose of ionizing radiation to a relatively small region encompassing the tumor and spares a significant portion of the remaining lung from high doses. However, the conformal high dose comes at the expense of treating a larger volume of normal lung to lower doses. In general, this has been deemed to be acceptable with an overall lower risk of radiation pneumonitis. However, in the face of predisposing factors, the higher doses delivered by this technique may lead to an increase in radiation pneumonitis. We report on two patients being treated with SBRT in which severe radiation pneumonitis developed in spite of our radiation dosimetry being significantly below the acceptable limit for lung toxicity. Both patients developed a "fulminant" form of radiation pneumonitis with radiographic abnormalities well beyond the treated volume. In one patient, the disease proved fatal. Both patients were on amiodarone at the time SBRT was administered. Given the rarity of fulminant radiation pneumonitis, especially with the relatively small fields treated by SBRT, we suspect that amiodarone enhanced the pulmonary toxicity.

Abstract: A 67-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis received a therapeutic dose (150 mg daily) of flecainide for three weeks. She was admitted to the Emergency Department for malaise and dizziness, and the electrocardiogram revealed ventricular tachycardia treated by amiodarone. Hemodynamic condition remained stable, and the toxicity of flecainide was initially not suspected until she developed within 8 hours a cardiogenic shock requiring vasopressors. The patient then received sodium bicarbonate (300 mmol) and dobutamine but experienced cardiac arrest two hours later. The administration of intravenous fat emulsion (IFE) was associated with return of spontaneous circulation, but there was a relapse of cardiovascular shock at the end of IFE infusion. The patient was placed on extracorporeal cardiac life support (ECLS), continuous hemofiltration, and hemoadsorption using the CytoSorb® cartridge. Serial determinations of serum flecainide concentration were obtained during the course of hemoadsorption, with a terminal half-life of 3.7 h during the first four hours and a global plasma clearance of 40.3 ml/min over the first 22 hours. The weaning of ECLS was possible on day 7. Intravenous fat emulsion infusion was followed by a significant increase in serum flecainide concentration. In addition, while conventional techniques of extrarenal epuration usually appear as poorly effective for flecainide removal, a mean plasma clearance of 40.3 ml/min was observed using the hemoadsorption technique based on CytoSorb® cartridge. However, the impact on the clinical course was probably extremely modest in comparison with ECLS.

Abstract: A 79-year-old man, who had significant cardiovascular morbidities, presented with out-of-hospital respiratory arrest. He regained breathing after brief cardiopulmonary resuscitation by his paramedic son. After meticulous investigations, acute cardiovascular events and metabolic causes were ruled out while features of obstructive sleep apnoea were elicited. The findings on in-laboratory polysomnography were compatible with severe obstructive sleep apnoea, with unusually prolonged apnoea duration of up to 2.7 min which most likely accounts for the presentation as 'respiratory arrest'. Thyroid function test for investigation of his weight gain confirmed hypothyroidism. His symptoms improved gradually after positive airway pressure therapy with bi-level support and thyroxine replacement. On further evaluation, his hypothyroidism is believed to be a complication of long-term amiodarone exposure. The case highlights that the combination of obstructive sleep apnoea and hypothyroidism can lead to catastrophic manifestation and the unusually long apnoea could be a feature prompting further workup for possible hypothyroidism.

Abstract: Linear immunoglobulin A (IgA) bullous dermatosis, also known as linear IgA disease, is a rare disorder with an incidence of about 0.5 to 2.3 cases per million individuals per year. In most of the cases, the cause is unknown; however, 50% of the cases are drug-induced. The disease has bimodal age predilection and occurs in children up to the age of 10 years and in adults usually after the age of 60 years. Common drugs that have been known to cause this disease include vancomycin, lithium, amiodarone, captopril, and some of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents. We report a case of linear IgA disease secondary to vancomycin.

Abstract: The oral anticoagulant warfarin is a vitamin K antagonist and is considered the first line anticoagulant in valvular atrial fibrillation. However prothrombin time should be closely monitored, drug interactions checked and compliance regarding diet ensured when the patient is on warfarin therapy. Anaemia should be looked for, evaluated for the cause and corrected since it is an independent predictor of bleeding and thrombotic episodes during warfarin therapy for atrial fibrillation We present an interesting case of anaemia which developed during warfarin therapy for atrial fibrillation. The patient was on amiodarone and was consuming leafy vegetables resulting in frequent raise in prothrombin time during which time she developed bleeding into the right femoral pseudoaneurysm which had developed following catheterisation for thrombectomy. Surgical correction of pseudoaneurysm was done, comedication was changed and diet compliance ensured which resulted in the subsequent maintenance of prothrombin time in the therapeutic range and steady haemoglobin levels.

Abstract: Kawasaki disease is an acute vasculitis of unknown etiology that usually occurs in children less than five years old. Coronary artery aneurysm due to arteritis is the most common cardiac complication. Chronic aneurysms are associated with an increased risk of developing luminal thrombosis and ischemic myocardial injury. We present a case of an 18-year-old male with a history of Kawasaki disease complicated by chronic giant aneurysms of the right and left coronary arteries. Serial echocardiographic studies and treadmill electrocardiogram stress tests as recent as 1.5 years before death revealed excellent cardiac function by clinical criteria. The decedent sustained a witnessed collapse after ingesting 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and ethanol. He was pronounced dead in the emergency department after unsuccessful resuscitative efforts. Autopsy revealed large aneurysms of the three main epicardial coronary arteries with extensive foci of severe stenosis by intimal fibrosis and organizing thrombus. Microscopic examination revealed multifocal severe myocyte hypertrophy. There were remote microinfarcts in the anterior and posterior aspects of the left ventricle and a recent, healing microinfarct in the posterior aspect of the left ventricle. Toxicology examination of postmortem femoral blood revealed MDMA, ethanol, and amiodarone. This case illustrates the residual, lasting effects of cardiac disease due to Kawasaki disease and a potential complication in the setting of use of an illicit stimulant, MDMA, an amphetamine derivative that produces sympathetic activation and cardiovascular effects including tachycardia, vasoconstriction, dysrhythmias, and coronary artery spasm. Kawasaki disease-related abnormalities of the heart likely resulted in a lower threshold for developing a fatal cardiac dysrhythmia under the circumstance of stimulant use.

Abstract: Left ventricular aneurysms (LVAs) are characterized by a wide connection to the left ventricle and paradoxical systolic motions. Although patients with LVAs are usually asymptomatic, some may present with arrhythmias, heart failure, and even cardiac arrest. In this case report, we describe a 62-year-old male patient who presented to our emergency service with complaints of palpitation and shortness of breath of 2 hours' duration. His blood pressure was 84/56 mm Hg, and he was in a confused state. An electrocardiogram revealed ventricular tachycardia (VT) with right bundle branch block and a ventricular rate of 188 bpm. The patient's hemodynamic instability necessitated a direct current cardioversion, which restored the sinus rhythm. During the in-hospital course, he had numerous recurrent VT episodes despite treatment with intravenous amiodarone and magnesium sulfate as well as radiofrequency ablation. Upon consensus with a cardiovascular surgeon's team, urgent surgery was performed due to the resistant VT episodes. The patient's clinical course was uneventful, and he was discharged on the 11th postoperative day. We have been following up the patient for almost 1 year, during which he has not experienced palpitations or associated symptoms. Our case indicates that surgery may be a preferable treatment option for patients with heart failure and resistant VT related to LVAs.

Abstract: Amiodarone is an antiarrhythmic agent used primarily to treat atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. However, the drug also has many adverse effects, including pulmonary toxicity, and a wide range of pulmonary diseases have been reported. Amiodarone-induced eosinophilic pneumonia is a relatively rare adverse effect with an incidence ranging between 5 and 13% [1]. The majority of cases have been diagnosed with lung biopsy, with only one prior reported case diagnosed by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) [2]. This report describes the second documented case of amiodarone-induced eosinophilic pneumonia diagnosed by eosinophilia on BAL cytology. In this case, complete cessation of symptoms occurred after discontinuation of amiodarone and treatment with corticosteroids. An updated review of the literature of amiodarone-induced eosinophilic pneumonia is also detailed.

Abstract: Cryptococcus neoformans is known to be a cause of meningitis. However, as cryptococcal endocarditis is rare, it is not well understood. Here, we describe a case with Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator associated endocarditis and meningitis caused by Cryptococcus neoformans and we review the literature associated cryptococcal endocarditis.
A 72 years old Japanese male presented in emergency department with non-productive cough and respiratory discomfort. His past medical history was ischemic heart disease four years ago and ICD was implanted. Physical examination was unremarkable. Chest computer tomography revealed ground glass opacity in the right lung. He received a diagnosis of amiodarone-induced interstitial pneumonitis and high dose steroid pulse therapy. Septic shock and acute respiratory failure occurred after steroid therapy. Cryptococcus neoformans was identified by blood culture and cerebral spinal fluid. Intravenous liposomal Amphotericin B and oral flucytosine were initiated. Transesophageal echocardiography revealed vegetation on the lead of the ICD. Diagnosis of cryptococcal endocarditis was made. The patient died despite antifungal therapy was continued.
We analyzed our case and 8 cases of cryptococcal endocarditis in the literature for 40 years. Almost all of the patients had previous valve replacement surgery or immunocompromised state. Three cases had meningitis. Surgery performed in 3 cases. The overall mortality rate were 44.4%.
Cryptococcal endocarditis is rare and carries a high mortality. Almost all of the patients had underlying diseases. Diagnosis needs repeating blood culture and echocardiogram, sometimes. Cryptococcal endocarditis needs lumber puncture for rule out meningitis.

Abstract: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common arrhythmia disease that can cause thromboembolic disease and/or heart failure, resulting in increased mortality. Propafenone, amiodarone, and flecainide are recommended for converting AF to sinus rhythm. Beta blockers, verapamil, diltiazem, and digoxin are recommended for controlling AF with fast ventricular rate (VR). In this case report, we found that verapamil successfully converted AF into sinus rhythm.
A 92-year-old woman presented with fast VR AF with a history of coronary heart disease, hypertension, and diabetes.
Verapamil can successfully convert AF into sinus rhythm.
The patient was treated with amiodarone or propafenone, yet still had AF. After stopping amiodarone and propafenone, the patient was given verapamil to control the VR, and following 9 days of treatment the patient switched to sinus rhythm. When verapamil treatment was stopped, the patient experienced AF recurrence. Upon receiving verapamil again, the AF again converted into sinus rhythm.
For the treatment of AF, nondihydropyridine calcium antagonists can be tried in the absence of antiarrhythmic drugs.

Abstract: All clinicians prescribing amiodarone require knowledge of the challenging diagnosis and management of amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity (APT), which is potentially fatal. APT should be considered early in all patients presenting with new respiratory symptoms and concurrent amiodarone therapy. Drug cessation and corticosteroid therapy can be highly effective once recognized.

Abstract: Pulmonary complications of long-term amiodarone use are well known. However, acute pneumonitis causing respiratory distress with short-term administration of amiodarone although rare is associated with high mortality. Early diagnosis and treatment with glucocorticoids significantly decrease associated mortality and morbidity. We are reporting one such case of amiodarone-induced pulmonary pneumonitis and its complete resolution with short-course glucocorticoid therapy. Thus, every clinician prescribing amiodarone should be well acquainted with this entity.

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated the utility of cardiac sympathetic denervation (CSD) in patients with ventricular tachycardia (VT) refractory to antiarrhythmic drugs and catheter or surgical ablation. We present our experience with bilateral CSD in a patient with a recurrent VT despite attempts at treatment with catheter ablation and antiarrhythmic drugs, and this is the first description of the successful management of an idiopathic refractory VT with a bilateral CSD and concomitant oral amiodarone, occurring after catheter ablation of persistent atrial fibrillation and idiopathic outflow tract premature ventricular contractions.

Abstract: Drug-induced photosensitivity develops when the use of oral or topical photosensitizing medications creates a rash after exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Medications most commonly implicated in photosensitive drug reactions include amiodarone, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, thiazides, tetracycline antibiotics, chlorpromazine, and fluoroquinolones. It is generally believed that drug-induced photosensitivity is an UVA phenomenon, caused by UV wavelengths between 315 and 400 nm. Here, we present a case of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ)-induced photosensitivity following exposure to 308-nm narrow-band (nb) UVB light emitted from an excimer laser in a patient undergoing treatment for plaque psoriasis. This patient had received biweekly treatments with the excimer laser for years prior without any history of adverse reactions. We believe that our patient suffered an acute photosensitivity to UVB due to new-onset HCTZ. Because nb UVB-emitting lasers are used to treat many dermatologic conditions, physicians should be aware of potential photosensitivity reactions, review medication lists and counsel patients accordingly.

Abstract: Adverse reactions to the antiarrhythmic medication amiodarone are severe, potentially life-threatening, and not rare. One in three patients on long-term therapy experience elevated liver enzymes, and clinically apparent liver toxicity occurs in 1% of patients treated. We report the case of a 76-year-old patient with amiodarone-induced intrahepatic cholestasis and prolonged hyperbilirubinemia despite the discontinuation of the offending agent. Current research hypothesizes that amiodarone leads to hepatic injury both by direct hepatotoxicity and by increasing the likelihood of hepatocytes to create abnormal, toxic metabolites. Increased awareness of such an adverse effect can guide clinicians toward the possible underlying etiologies of prolonged jaundice.

Abstract: Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is an inherited myocardial disease characterized by fibrofatty replacement and ventricular arrhythmias. ARVC is believed to be a disease of the young, with most cases being diagnosed before the age of 40 years. We report here a case of newly diagnosed ARVC in an octogenarian associated with a pathogenic variant in the plakophilin 2 gene (PKP2).
An 80-year-old Japanese man was referred for sustained ventricular tachycardia. His baseline electrocardiogram showed negative T waves in V1-V4. Right ventriculography showed right ventricular aneurysm. Because this case met three major criteria, ARVC was diagnosed. He was successfully treated with radiofrequency ablation and oral amiodarone. Genetic analysis identified an insertion mutation in exon 8 of PKP2 (1725_1728dupGATG), which caused a frameshift and premature termination of translation (R577DfsX5).
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of newly diagnosed ARVC in an octogenarian associated with a loss-of-function PKP2 pathogenic variant. Although the late clinical presentation of ARVC is rare, it should be included in the differential diagnosis when treating older patients with ventricular tachyarrhythmias.

Abstract: Amiodarone, a broad-spectrum antiarrhythmic drug, is widely used for the clinical treatment of tachyarrhythmias because of its safety and efficacy.
A 30-year-old woman presented with known paroxysmal atrial tachycardia and severe preeclampsia. Two days before admission, she had given birth to twins. She described her symptoms as a sudden palpitation at 10:20 accompanied by chest tightness and shortness of breath.
Cardiac arrhythmia and acute left heart failure.
Furosemide and sodium nitroprusside were administered to control the heart failure. At 16:20, 150 mg amiodarone (15 mg/min) was injected intravenously and continued at 1 mg/min. At 16:50, her electrocardiogram showed possible atrial tachycardia or atrial flutter with a ventricular rate of 206 beats/min. Administration of amiodarone was stopped at 17:23, and the medication was changed to esmolol.
After 3 minutes, the palpitations stopped, the heart rate changed to a sinus rhythm, and the ventricular rate was 100 beats/min. Four days later, the patient underwent an electrophysiologic study and radiofrequency ablation.
When amiodarone is used to treat atrial arrhythmia, the ventricular rate may accelerate, which can cause patients with borderline heart failure to develop acute heart failure or further deterioration of acute heart failure. For heart failure induced or mediated by atrial arrhythmias, short-term β-blockers may be used to control the ventricular rate more quickly and effectively and to prevent the progression of heart failure.

Abstract: A 28-year-old female presented with fulminant lymphocytic myocarditis. She developed cardiogenic shock, frequent sustained ventricular tachycardia, and fibrillation (VT and VF). The left ventricular ejection fraction improved from 5% to 40% after medical therapy, but the right ventricular systolic dysfunction and enlargement persisted. In addition, sustained VTs, requiring direct current cardioversion, occurred during oral administration of amiodarone following intravenous amiodarone, even after percutaneous stellate ganglion block. Standard body surface electrocardiogram (ECG) screening for an implantation of a subcutaneous implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (S-ICD) (EMBLEM™ S-ICD, Boston Scientific, Marlborough, MA, USA) demonstrated that two of the three sensing vectors were eligible in spite of very low-amplitude QRS complexes in the body surface ECGs. After implantation of the S-ICD, the patient experienced repetitive, inappropriate shocks due to pectoral myopotential oversensing, which could not be resolved by reprogramming the device settings. Thus, the S-ICD lead was changed from the standard left parasternal position to the midline of the sternum to reduce muscular noise due to myopotentials. Thereafter, the patient experienced appropriate ICD shocks for sustained VT and VF but no inappropriate ICD sensing or shocks. Lead repositioning may be one of the feasible solutions in S-ICD patients with low-amplitude QRS complexes and inappropriate shocks due to myopotential oversensing which cannot be resolved by reprogramming the device settings.

Abstract: Atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia (AVRT) is the most common supraventricular tachycardia occurring in children. However, in complex congenital heart disease patients with a different heart anatomy and conduction system morphology, accessory pathway modification may be particularly challenging because of distortion of typical anatomic landmarks.
A 10-year-old boy with tricuspid atresia and history of bidirectional Glenn operation had recurrent chest distress and palpitation for 3 months. He had multiple hospitalizations for narrow-QRS tachycardia with poor hemodynamic tolerance, despite the use of adenosine and amiodarone.
AVRT. Tricuspid atresia with secundum atrial septal defect, large ventricular septal defect, and right ventricular outflow tract stenosis.

The child has not had a recurrent AVRT during 6 months of follow-up and is waiting for Fontan operation.
Since there is an increased risk of accessory pathways in patients with tricuspid atresia, all these patients should be checked before the Fontan operation to exclude congenital accessory pathways.

Abstract: The risk factors of acquired long QT syndrome (aLQTS) are sometimes overlooked in clinics. Drugs, hypokalemia, age and female sex are well-known risk factors of QT prolongation-dependent torsade de pointes (TdP), which explains the high incidence of sudden cardiac death in LQT patients. Here, we report a case of an elderly female patient with lung cancer who was in poor condition, for whom amiodarone was mistakenly prescribed to rectify premature ventricular contractions. QT prolongation-dependent TdP immediately followed intravenous injection of amiodarone. Fortunately, the patient survived aborted sudden cardiac arrest after effective cardio-pulmonary resuscitation and electric defibrillation. Upon reviewing the clinical information, several pre-existing risk factors of aLQTS and TdP were identified. The mistaken prescription of amiodarone provoked TdP after these risk factors were overlooked in this case and thus predisposed this patient to a high susceptibility of drug-induced TdP.

Abstract: A 63-year-old man underwent cardioversion of atrial fibrillation with intravenous amiodarone through an antecubital fossa cannula. Mid-infusion, the cannula tissued. He developed immediate pain and swelling. At 3 weeks, he continued to have significant pain and had developed a fixed flexion deformity. MRI demonstrated focal myositis of the biceps and brachialis muscles. Treatment included physiotherapy and plastic surgery but sadly in spite of this, the patient has had minimal symptomatic improvement at 1 year. Amiodarone extravasation is well recognised to cause local injection site reactions. Involvement of deeper tissues is rare. To our knowledge, this is only the second description of a consequent focal myositis in the literature.

Abstract: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), also known as pseudotumour cerebri syndrome (PTCS), is characterized by the presence of signs and symptoms of raised intracranial pressure without evidence of any intracranial structural cause and with normal cerebrospinal fluid microscopy and biochemistry. Obesity, various systemic diseases and endocrine conditions, and a number of medications are known to be risk factors for PTCS. The medications commonly associated with PTCS are amiodarone, antibiotics, corticosteroids, cyclosporine, growth hormone, oral contraceptives, vitamin A analogues, lithium, phenytoin, NSAIDs, leuprolide acetate, and some neuroleptic drugs. In relation to antibiotics, quinolones may cause intracranial hypertension, and most reported cases of quinolone-induced intracranial hypertension were associated with nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, or pefloxacin. Literature reports of levofloxacin-induced PTCS are rare. Some authors recently hypothesized that Mycoplasma pneumoniae may trigger PTCS.
We report on a 14-year-old overweight White Italian boy who suffered headache, diplopia, and severe bilateral papilloedema after a Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection, exacerbated on levofloxacin intake. A spontaneous improvement in headache and a reduction in diplopia was seen during hospitalisation. Oral acetazolamide therapy led to the regression of papilloedema in about five months. No permanent eye damage has been observed in our patient to date.
PTCS pathophysiology may be multifactorial and its specific features and severity may be a consequence of both constitutional and acquired factors interacting synergistically. It may be useful for paediatricians to know that some antibiotics may have the potential to precipitate PTCS in patients who already have an increased CSF pressure due to a transitory imbalanced CSF circulation caused by infections such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae, with headache being the first and most sensitive, but also the least specific, symptom.

Abstract: A 54-year-old man with the lysosomal storage disorder Anderson-Fabry disease (AFD) and cardiac involvement was placed on amiodarone for treatment of symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Shortly thereafter, he developed symptoms of acute decompensated heart failure, requiring hospital admission. Endomyocardial biopsy demonstrated findings consistent with AFD and possible amiodarone toxicity. Amiodarone was discontinued, and the patient's heart failure resolved with return to baseline status. Amiodarone is known to alter lysosomal pH and enzyme activity, and this case illustrates how it should be used with considerable caution in patients with AFD.

Abstract: Amiodarone is an antiarrhythmic drug which is used to treat and prevent several dysrhythmias. This includes ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation, wide complex tachycardia, as well as atrial fibrillation (AF) and paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. Amiodarone may prove to be the agent of choice where the patient is hemodynamically unstable and unsuitable for direct current (DC) cardioversion. Although, it is not recommended for long-term use. The physician might encounter issues when differentiating amiodarone-induced lung toxicity with suspicion of interstitial lung disease, cancer or vasculitis. Adverse drug reactions are difficult to confirm and it leads to serious problems of pharmacotherapy.
A 78-year-old Caucasian male pensioner complaining of fever, dyspnea, malaise, non-productive cough, fatigue, weight loss, diagnosed with acute respiratory failure with a 16-year long history of amiodarone use and histologically confirmed temporal arteritis with long-term glucocorticosteroid (GCC) therapy. Patient was treated for temporal arteritis with GCC for ~ 1 year, then fever and dyspnea occurred, and the patient was hospitalized for treatment of bilateral pneumonia. Chest X-ray and chest high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) indicated several possible diagnoses: drug-induced interstitial lung disease, autoimmune interstitial lung disease, previously excluded pulmonary TB. Amiodarone was discontinued. Antibiotic therapy for bilateral pneumonia was started. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy with bronchial washings and brushings was performed. Acid fast bacilli (AFB) were found on Ziehl-Nielsen microscopy and tuberculosis (TB) was confirmed (later confirmed to be Mycobacterium tuberculosis in culture), initial treatment for TB was started. After a few months of treating for TB, patient was diagnosed with pneumonia and sepsis, empiric antibiotic therapy was prescribed. After reevaluation and M. Tuberculosis identification, the patient was referred to the Tuberculosis hospital for further treatment. After 6 months of TB treatment, pneumonia occurred which was complicated by sepsis. Despite the treatment, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome evolved and patient died. Probable cause of death: pneumonia and sepsis.
The current clinical case emphasizes issues that a physician may encounter in the differential diagnostics of amiodarone-induced lung toxicity with other lung diseases.

Abstract: Recurrent ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF) in patients with myocardial ischemia requiring hemodynamic support can be refractory to available antiarrhythmic agents and even to cardioversion and defibrillation. The purpose of this study was to report the effect of intravenous ibutilide in patients with a VT and/or VF storm in the presence of incomplete revascularization requiring hemodynamic support.
Standard continuous telemetry and frequent 12-lead electrocardiograms were obtained to determine the effect of intravenous Ibutilide in these patients. We studied six consecutive patients (age 60 ± 12 years; five males) with incomplete revascularization and mechanical support (extracorporeal membrane of oxygenation = 2; left ventricular assist device = 4) with VT/VF refractory to lidocaine and amiodarone. Intravenous ibutilide was given as a last resort for management of their ventricular arrhythmias. Intravenous ibutilide (1-2 mg) allowed restoration of sinus rhythm in three patients with persistent VF that were refractory to multiple defibrillation shocks. When the 24-hour period before and after ibutilide administration was compared, this drug markedly reduced the number of required cardioversions/defibrillations in all patients from 20 ± 9 to 0.7 ± 0.8 shocks ( P = 0.036).
In patients with myocardial ischemia requiring hemodynamic support, intravenous Ibutilide demonstrates a potent antiarrhythmic effect and can facilitate defibrillation in patients with refractory VF.

Abstract: BACKGROUND QT prolongation is a common, easily overlooked clinical problem with potentially dire consequences. Drug-induced and congenital forms are not mutually exclusive, but are treated differently. Here, we present a case of cryptogenic underlying congenital long QT syndrome (cLQTS) successfully treated with isoproterenol, a drug contraindicated in most congenital forms of this condition. CASE REPORT We present the case of a 54-year-old man who experienced severe QT prolongation after drug administration followed by recurrent episodes of torsade de pointes (TdP) with subsequent ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest unresponsive to typical therapy. After failing electrolyte repletion, magnesium, amiodarone, and lidocaine, the patient was started on an isoproterenol drip to achieve a heart rate of at least 90 beats per minute (bpm). Isoproterenol resulted in an immediate near-normalization of his QT interval and cessation of his recurrent TdP. The patient was subsequently found to have a mutation of undetermined significance in the KCNQ1 gene, which is implicated in long QT syndrome type 1 (LQT1). Although isoproterenol is contraindicated in LQT1, our patient had an astonishingly therapeutic benefit. CONCLUSIONS After reviewing the electrophysiology of the delayed rectifier potassium current as it relates to long QT syndrome, we propose a mechanism by which our patient's specific mutation may have allowed him to derive benefit from isoproterenol treatment. We believe that there are patients with variants of LQT1 who can be safely treated with isoproterenol.

Abstract: We report a case of endogenous lipoid pneumonia secondary to long-term use of amiodarone (> 30 years) for atrial fibrillation in a 76-year-old Caucasian woman, presenting with cough and dyspnea. Endogenous Lipoid pneumonia is a rare underdiagnosed condition more prevalent in adults. It is usually asymptomatic and a diagnosis is generally made in patients who have become clinically unstable or when an abnormal lung shadow is found on a chest X-ray. In the case here described it was diagnosed by fiberoptic bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BALF) where fat-laden macrophages (oil red O stain) were identified. Since a history of use of oil-based products had been ruled out, amiodarone was deemed to be the most likely cause of lipoid pneumonia. The patient was managed with the replacement of amiodarone with digoxin and treated with oral prednisolone. The patient has remained clinically stable with radiological improvement during a follow-up of two years.

Abstract: Yılmaz-Semerci S, Bornaun H, Kurnaz D, Cebeci B, Babayiğit A, Büyükkale G, Çetinkaya M. Neonatal atrial flutter: Three cases and review of the literature. Turk J Pediatr 2018; 60: 306-309. Atrial flutter (AFl) is known to be a seldom type of fetal and neonatal arrhythmia. Although it could end in severe morbidities such as hydrops fetalis or even death, with early prenatal diagnosis and prompt therapeutic approaches the majority of AFl cases show good prognosis. Neonatal AFl might be resistant to first step therapies. Therefore, secondary agents like flecainide, amiodarone, sotalol and cardioversion, if required, could be influent in perinatal tachyarrhythmia. In addition, close follow-up even after discharge is very important to keep all follow-up appointments. Herein, we present three cases of fetal/neonatal AFl in light of the literature and discuss the characteristics, diagnosis and treatment options.

Abstract: A 66-year-old female presented to the emergency room with an episode of chest pain that lasted for a few minutes before resolving spontaneously. Electrocardiogram showed a left bundle branch block, left ventricular hypertrophy, and T wave inversions in the lateral leads. Initial cardiac troponin level was 0.15 ng/ml, with levels of 4 ng/ml and 9 ng/ml obtained 6 and 12 hours later, respectively. The peak blood pressure recorded was 195/43 mmHg. Echocardiogram with DEFINITY showed a small left ventricular cavity with apical hypertrophy, and coronary angiogram showed no stenotic or occluding lesions in the coronary arteries. The patient was admitted for a type 2 myocardial infarction with hypertensive crises. She was diagnosed with having apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which is a variant of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) in which the hypertrophy predominantly involves the apex of the left ventricle resulting in midventricular obstruction, as opposed to the left ventricular outflow tract obstruction seen in HCM. Patients with apical HCM may present with angina, heart failure, myocardial infarction, syncope, or arrhythmias and are typically managed with medications like verapamil and beta-blockers for those who have symptoms and antiarrhythmic agents like amiodarone and procainamide for treatment of atrial fibrillation and ventricular arrhythmias. An implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) is recommended for high-risk HCM patients with a history of previous cardiac arrest or sustained episodes of ventricular tachycardia, syncope, and a family history of sudden death.

Abstract: Amiodarone treatment is contraindicated during breastfeeding. As the regional pharmacovigilance centre, we were contacted for information relative to the possibility of breastfeeding after single intravenous administration of 450 mg amiodarone to a breastfeeding woman. A monitoring of amiodarone concentration in plasma and milk was performed in the mother. At day 4, milk concentration of amiodarone reached a peak (233 μg/L) and milk to plasma ratio was determined to 3.5. Milk concentration was still detectable at day 10 (132 μg/L). The maximal relative infant dose was estimated to be 0.6% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage, corresponding to 0.18% of the usual posology used in children by parenteral route. The review of the literature retrieved one publication suggesting that a single intravenous administration of 150 mg of amiodarone to a mother represents a negligible infant risk based on low breast milk concentration. The French National Pharmacovigilance database query did not disclose any case of side effects during breastfeeding after a single dose of amiodarone. A very limited exposition of breastfed newborns to amiodarone, as well as a low risk of side effects, is expected after a single administration of amiodarone to their mothers.

Abstract: Brugada pattern is a well-known pathological finding on electrocardiogram (ECG) which increases the likelihood of cardiac arrest due to ventricular arrhythmia. These cases generally present in younger patients without evidence of an electrolyte abnormality, structural heart disease, or cardiac ischemia. In many instances, this pattern is either hidden on initial presentation or presents as an incidental finding on an EKG. Often times the Brugada syndrome leads to sudden cardiac death or more rarely can be unmasked with a class 1A or 1C anti-arrhythmic agent. Here, we present a distinctive case in which the pattern was exposed by amiodarone during the emergent treatment of Ventricular Tachycardia (VT).
A 34-year-old female, without significant cardiac history, presented to the Emergency Department after multiple near syncopal episodes at home. Initial ECG showed VT vs. SVT. After a failed trial of adenosine, the patient was treated with 150 mg amiodarone and became hypotensive needing an electrical cardioversion. After becoming bradycardic, the amiodarone drip was discontinued and she was admitted to the MICU. An echocardiogram and left heart catheterization showed no evidence of coronary artery disease or decreased ejection fraction. The patient's ECG now showed a subtle Brugada Type 3 pattern and she received a dual chamber AICD upon discharge.
This case emphasizes the awareness needed to seek out this pattern on subsequent ECG's. With the high lethality of Brugada, the emergency physician must recognize that multiple drugs can evoke this pattern after initial presentation.

Abstract: Although Kounis syndrome was described almost 3 decades ago, there has been a notable increase in the reports of cases of acute coronary syndromes developed in the context of allergic reactions, also known as Kounis syndrome. This article discusses the diagnostic possibility in the face of an acute biventricular failure in the course of an anaphylactic reaction during the intra-operative period of a cardiac valve surgery.

Abstract: BACKGROUND Herpes zoster is caused by the reactivation of the varicella zoster virus (VZV) and usually presents with vesicular skin lesions with a dermatomal distribution. Disseminated herpes zoster (DHZ) infection is characterized by non-dermatomal skin eruptions, often with involvement of other organs, and occurs in immunocompromised patients. CASE REPORT A 69-year-old man who was treated with prednisolone for amiodarone-associated interstitial lung disease, presented with seizures and altered consciousness. He had an erythematous rash with raised vesicles involving the skin of the genital region, left thigh, and abdomen. Following a diagnosis of DHZ with herpes zoster meningoencephalitis, he was treated with intravenous acyclovir. However, his level of consciousness did not improve, and he died of respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS A diagnosis of DHZ should be considered in immunosuppressed patients treated with steroids who present with seizures. A detailed search for skin eruptions should be conducted to enable early diagnosis and treatment.

Abstract: Amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism is a known side effect of amiodarone treatment. In the pediatric population, long-term amiodarone treatment is rarely indicated because of its severe side effects including thyroid function impairment. Treatment is therefore restricted to therapy-resistant arrhythmias. In the literature, scarce data are available on the management and therapy of amiodarone-induced thyroid dysfunction at a young age. We present three adolescent patients developing amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis in the months after amiodarone therapy. A latency period for thyroid dysfunction has been described in adulthood but was not previously reported in pediatric patients. The gap between amiodarone treatment and the development of symptoms and the diagnosis of hyperthyroidism was between 3 and 10 months. In two patients, hyperthyroidism was transient and resolved without treatment. These two patients, one boy and on girl, were almost asymptomatic. In contrast, in one male patient overt and severe hyperthyroidism developed. We began treatment with thiamazole without benefit. Control of hyperthyroidism was achieved under prednisone treatment, which was continued for 9 months. Clinical evaluation proved an amiodarone-induced destructive thyroiditis in this patient. Amiodarone-induced thyroid dysfunction is frequent also in pediatric patients with long-term amiodarone treatment. Patients and clinicians should be aware of the impact of amiodarone on thyroid function during and also in the months and maybe years after treatment. Careful follow-up is needed, as symptoms might be associated with the underlying cardiac disease in these patients. Amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis often resolves without treatment but can be challenging in some cases.

Abstract: BACKGROUND Following catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation, increased incidence of ventricular arrhythmia has been observed. We report a case of sustained ventricular arrhythmia in a patient who underwent cryoballoon-based pulmonary vein isolation for symptomatic persistent atrial fibrillation. CASE REPORT A 57-year-old patient with dilated cardiomyopathy underwent CB-based pulmonary vein isolation for symptomatic persistent AF. On the day following an uneventful procedure, the patient for the first time experienced a sustained ventricular tachycardia that exacerbated into VT storm. Each arrhythmia was terminated by the ICD that had been implanted for primary prevention. Antiarrhythmic treatment with amiodarone was initiated immediately. The patient remained free from sustained ventricular arrhythmia during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS After pulmonary vein isolation, physicians should be vigilant for ventricular arrhythmia. The influence of atrial autonomic innervation on ventricular electrophysiology is largely unknown.

Abstract: A 73-year-old man with history of nephrolithiasis was admitted after a witnessed cardiac arrest. In the emergency department, the patient had several runs of ventricular fibrillation treated with defibrillation and amiodarone infusion. Echocardiography revealed reduced ejection fraction with multiple mobile structures attached to the tricuspid valve leaflets. Due to concern for possible endocarditis, the patient was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics. On the following day, a renal ultrasound was performed for acute kidney injury followed by a non-contrast CT scan that revealed an obstructing 21 mm left-sided ureteral stone with pyohydronephrosis. He underwent emergent nephrostomy tube placement. Blood and urine cultures subsequently demonstrated the growth of

Abstract: Myxedema coma is a rare but highly fatal condition with reported mortality >40%-50%. Early recognition and prompt treatment are critical for survival. Here we describe a case of possible postoperative myxedema coma after subacute neck hematoma evacuation after hemithyroidectomy in a patient on concurrent amiodarone therapy. Symptoms included somnolence, hypothermia, and prolonged QTc with torsades de pointes resistant to magnesium therapy requiring defibrillation and overdrive pacing. Consideration of the possible diagnosis of myxedema coma resulted in prompt therapy and symptom resolution within 48 hours. Thyroid disorders, although rare, should be considered in the postoperative setting.

Abstract: Rivaroxaban is a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) approved as an important alternative to warfarin in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. We report the case of an 87-year-old man with past medical history of nonvalvular atrial fibrillation on rivaroxaban and recently started amiodarone for pulseless ventricular tachycardia who presented to our hospital with intermittent chest pain and was diagnosed with spontaneous hemopericardium causing cardiac tamponade. The culprit drugs were discontinued, and the patient was treated with emergent pericardiocentesis. Both rivaroxaban and amiodarone are substrates for the CYP3A4 hepatic pathway, and concomitant use can result in increased plasma rivaroxaban levels causing an increased propensity to bleeding. While most physicians are cognizant of the need for renal dosing of rivaroxaban, this article aims to increase awareness of its interactions with drugs that are also metabolized through the same hepatic CYP450 pathway.

Abstract: Amiodarone is one of the most commonly used antiarrhythmic drugs. Despite its well-known side effects, amiodarone is considered to be a relatively safe drug, especially in short-term usage to prevent life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. Our case demonstrates an instance where short-term usage can yield drug side effect.

Abstract: A drug-induced liver injury is one of the most common causes of acute liver failure. While acetaminophen is the most common etiology, other offending medications include amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, amiodarone, isoniazid, and fluoroquinolones to name a few. Gabapentin, a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) analogue, has infrequently been reported to cause liver injury; however, the causality in the previous reports is contested. Herein, we report a gabapentin-induced hepatocellular injury in a patient without another identifiable cause for acute liver injury. Discontinuing gabapentin resulted in rapid reversal improvement in hepatocellular injury.

Abstract: Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia is a rhythm disorder that develops due to genetic reasons in the absence of structural cardiac abnormalities. Ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, cardiac arrest, and death may occur. Two-year-old patient presented to the Emergency Department with sudden cardiac arrest. He had syncope attacks after playing with his brother and he was followed up by the pediatric neurology and cardiology clinics. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed, and he was then transferred to the Intensive Care Unit because of hypotension; dobutamine and norepinephrine treatment was started. After treatment, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, and cardiac arrest developed. Dobutamine and noradrenaline was stopped immediately and amiodarone was started. A genetic test revealed heterozygote missense mutation (c.9110G>A(p.Gly3037Asp)) in exon 64 of the RYR2 gene, which is compatible with catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. This mutation has been reported in the literature for the first time. This case is presented with the purpose of highlighting catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia.

Abstract: A case of a young Saudi patient with a previous diagnosis of bronchial asthma, nasal polyps, and chronic smoker, presented with atypical chest pain, elevated serum troponin and borderline ischemic electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, with no significant regional wall motion abnormalities at bedside echocardiography is reported. The patient was admitted to the coronary care unit for continuous monitoring as possible acute coronary syndrome, non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). One hour after admission, the patient had ventricular fibrillation (VF) cardiac arrest that required three DC shocks and amiodarone bolus before returning of spontaneous circulation, which followed the fourth shock. The resuscitation took 15 minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). An immediate 12-leads ECG showed significant ST elevation in precordial leads that mandate an urgent coronary angiogram that revealed patent coronary arteries, therefore spasm of normal coronary arteries was postulated as the operative factor. The cardiac magnetic resonance image (MRI) showed a picture of transmural anterior myocardial infarction, which correlates with the follow up echocardiogram reporting hypokinetic anterior wall. A complete history was taken and no use of illicit drugs or alcohol was found. The unusual presentation in such a patient with evidence of extensive anterior STEMI and normal coronary arteries raise the thought of considering uncommon causes. In view of previous medical history and laboratory evidence of eosinophilia, Kounis syndrome was considered dominant in the differential diagnosis.

Abstract: Aripiprazole is an atypical antipsychotic drug with a polypharmacological mechanism of action and a favorable tolerability profile. Its major indications are schizophrenia and mania in adults and adolescents. Here we present the case of a 43-year-old Caucasian man with schizophrenia who developed atrial fibrillation (AF) after starting aripiprazole treatment. Prior to this treatment, he had never received any antipsychotic drugs. On admission to our inpatient unit, he showed severe psychotic symptoms and was started on aripiprazole with a rapid titration regimen (15 mg on the first day and then 15 mg twice daily thereafter) in combination with lorazepam (2.5 mg thrice a day). On the third day, the patient exhibited vomiting and an irregular pulse. An electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed new-onset AF with rapid ventricular response. Aripiprazole was discontinued and cardioversion was obtained with intravenous amiodarone. A different antipsychotic treatment was thus started (perphenazine 12 mg/d), which led to symptom remission without any relevant adverse effects. During the 2-year follow-up observation, neither psychotic symptoms nor ECG abnormalities were detected. Besides aripiprazole, other co-occurring factors might have contributed to the onset of AF in our patient, namely hypertension, low-grade diastolic dysfunction, chronic inflammatory disease, CYP2D6 polymorphism, corticosteroid and antiulcer treatment, and a family loading for myocardial infarction. In conclusion, our case study suggests that although aripiprazole has fewer cardiovascular effects than other antipsychotic drugs, in the presence of concomitant risk factors, high dose, and rapid titration regimen, regular monitoring of clinical parameters and ECG is highly recommended.

Abstract: Metoprolol and amiodarone are common antiarrhythmic drugs used in clinics throughout the world. The taste and smell alterations induced by antiarrhythmic drugs remain uncommon throughout the world, with less than 10 reported cases.
In this case report, we describe a case of a 73-year-old female, diagnosed with arrhythmias, was treated for metoprolol. At the third week of metoprolol treatment, the patient noticed a qualitative change in her ability to smell, also called dysosmia. After the metoprolol was tapered, her ability to smell was recovered. However, her arrhythmia was getting worse and the patient was given amiodarone. After using amiodarone for about 2 weeks, the patient felt hypogeusia, or loss of taste sensation.
The patient was diagnosed as dysosmia and taste disturbance induced by the antiarrhythmic drugs.
After noticed the side effects of the antiarrhythmic drugs, we asked the patient to abandon the drugs and have a radiofrequency ablation.
Her ability of smell and taste were recovered after withdrawing the antiarrhythmic drugs. Also, in the follow-up appointment, she reported no complaints of smell or taste anymore.
These rare sensory disorders induced by anti-arrhythmic drugs were less documented in past literature. Our case report describes a patient with an arrhythmia who suffered reversible dysosmia and hypogeusia after taking metoprolol and amiodarone, respectively. We conclude that smell and taste disorders should be made aware to patients during the anti-arrhythmic treatment, helping to promote the safety of patients and drug compliance.

Abstract: "Electrical storm" is a life-threatening condition defined as the occurrence of at least two episodes of malignant ventricular arrhythmia in a 24-hour period despite anti-arrhythmic therapy. It leads to unpredictable degrees of clinical instability - in the most severe cases mechanical support for circulation and oxygenation and for definitive therapy radiofrequency ablation or cardiac sympathetic denervation. We describe a case of medication refractory electrical storm complicating severe left ventricular dysfunction after an anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction.

Abstract: A 10-month-old infant experienced cardiac arrest caused by ventricular fibrillation (VF). His electrocardiogram (ECG) at rest was within the normal range. Amiodarone was indispensable due to its refractoriness to defibrillation. After implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) implantation, ICD shock was delivered. ICD recordings documented VF and ventricular tachycardia (VT) triggered by premature ventricular contractions with an extremely short coupling interval (240 ms), which were controlled by verapamil. To the best of our knowledge, our case is the first infant with ScTdP. As the electrical storm with ScTdP occurs unpredictably, it can be a cause of sudden infant death syndrome.

Abstract: Junctional ectopic tachycardia (JET) is a rare form of arrhythmia that is most commonly seen during infancy. JET is continuous and incessant, characterized by persistently high heart rates that may result in impaired cardiac function and tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy. Despite the availability of multiple antiarrhythmic treatments, including flecainide and amiodarone, management of JET is generally very difficult. Catheter ablation has a high risk of atrioventricular block and it may require the placement of a pacemaker. Ivabradine, also known as a cardiac pacemaker cell inhibitor, is a new-generation antiarrhythmic used to treat sinus tachycardia and angina pectoris in adult patients. In this article, we present three cases of subjects with infantile congenital JET who were admitted to our clinic with a tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy. The age of the subjects ranged from 52 days to 10 months. Although the cases of tachycardia could not be controlled by multiple antiarrhythmics, including a combination of amiodarone and flecainide combined with either propranolol or digoxin, they were rapidly converted into sinus rhythm with an ivabradine treatment of 0.1-0.2 mg/kg/day. No cardiac or other side effects were observed during ivabradine treatment, and left ventricular functions and rhythms improved within 24 hours. These three cases therefore provide hope that ivabradine may be a suitable standard initial treatment for congenital JET. However, additional research is needed to confirm the validity of these results in other circumstances.

Abstract: Amiodarone is a benzofuran derivative that contains 37% iodine by weight and is structurally similar to the thyroid hormones. Amiodarone has a complex effect on the thyroid gland, ranging from abnormalities of thyroid function tests to overt thyroid dysfunction, with either thyrotoxicosis or hypothyroidism. Myxedema coma secondary to amiodarone use has been rarely reported in the literature. Our two case reports are an add on to the literature, and illustrate that amiodarone is an important cause of thyroid dysfunction including hypothyroidism and myxedema coma. Hence, healthcare providers should have a high index of suspicion for these conditions while treating patients who are taking amiodarone therapy as early recognition and management are essential to optimize outcomes.

Abstract: An 86-year-old woman presented with marked blistering of her left index fingertip and ulceration of the left middle fingertip, with a 2-year history of recurrent blistering and ulceration of her fingers bilaterally. She denied any preceding finger trauma, although she reported frequent gardening. She denied systemic symptoms. Her medical history was significant for a 2-year history of atrial fibrillation on carvedilol, amiodarone and apixaban, and she was a lifetime non-smoker. On admission, she had elevated inflammatory markers but unremarkable autoantibodies. Radiograph of the hand revealed diffuse soft tissue fullness and subtle irregularities at the tuft of the index finger, but all other investigations were unremarkable. The lesion was incised and drained, revealing blood-tinged purulent fluid. Wound biopsy revealed spongiosis with neutrophils, consistent with a diagnosis of blistering distal dactylitis.

Abstract: Up to the beginning of 2018, a total of eight cases describing rare but clinically important drug interactions between rosuvastatin and ticagrelor which resulted in rhabdomyolysis have been noted in the Global World Health Organization (WHO) adverse drug reaction (ADR) database (VigiBase) as well as in available literature. There are several possible factors which could contribute to the onset of rhabdomyolysis: old age, initially excessive rosuvastatin dose, drug-drug interactions (DDI) on metabolic enzymes (CYPs and UGTs) and drug transporter levels (ABCB1, ABCG2, OATP1B1) and pharmacogenetic predisposition. We reviewed all available cases plus the case of an 87-year-old female Croatian/Caucasian patient who developed rhabdomyolysis following concomitant treatment with rosuvastatin and ticagrelor. The results of the pharmacogenetic analysis indicated that the patient was a carrier of inactivating alleles CYP2C9*1/*3, CYP3A4*1/*22, CYP3A5*3/*3, CYP2D6*1/*4, UGT1A1*28/*28, UGT2B7 -161C/T, ABCB1 3435C/T and ABCB1 1237C/T which could have added to the interactions not only between ticagrelor and rosuvastatin but also other concomitantly prescribed medicines, such as amiodarone and proton pump inhibitors. In this case report, the possible multifactorial causes for rhabdomyolysis following concomitant use of rosuvastatin and ticagrelor such as old age, polypharmacy, renal impairment, along with pharmacogenetics will be discussed.

Abstract: Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is a rare but potentially lethal inherited arrhythmia syndrome induced by adrenergic stress. Due to the atypical clinical manifestations in early age, limited recognition and experience of pediatric cardiologists, and low awareness of the significance of genetic diagnosis in some underdeveloped areas in China, a delayed or missed diagnosis of CPVT in children is common and concerning.
A 9-year and 3-month male child with recurrent exercise-induced syncope accompanied by convulsion was initially misdiagnosed as epilepsy since the first manifestation at the age of 3 years. Due to the identification of polymorphic ventricular premature beats, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (VT), and supraventricular tachycardia, a cardiogenic etiology was established. The patient received a successive treatment by propafenone, amiodarone, a combination of amiodarone with metoprolol, and metoprolol alone for up to 6 years.
Given the poor response to conventional antiarrhythmics, excise-induced syncope, QRS morphology and a structurally normal heart, the diagnosis of CPVT was suspected, and ultimately confirmed by detection of polymorphic and bidirectional VT with degeneration into ventricular fibrillation during exercise testing. In addition, a heterozygous mutant of RYR2 at c.7580T > G was identified by genetic testing.
Due to the unavailability of flecainide in China and the refusal of implantable cardioverter defibrillator implantation by his parents, this patient continued to be treated with oral metoprolol.
Unfortunately, the effect was unfavorable during 4 months outpatient follow-up.
CPVT should be suspected in young patients with a normal baseline electrocardiogram (EKG), a structurally normal heart and polymorphic and/or bidirectional ventricular tachycardia induced by exercise or emotional stress. Exercise and genetic testing is essential and significant for a timely and accurate diagnosis of CPVT. The current study firstly reported a case with CPVT associated with a mutant of RYR2 at c.7580T > G in children.

Abstract: A challenge in ICU EEG interpretation is identifying subclinical status epilepticus versus patterns on the ictal-interictal continuum versus other repetitive patterns. In the electrically noisy intensive care unit, identifying and eliminating interference and artifact allow accurate diagnoses from the EEG, avoiding unnecessary treatment or sedation.
We present a case during Impella (Abiomed Inc, Danvers, MA) continuous flow left ventricular assist device use where the EEG artifact was initially misinterpreted as seizure by the resident and treated as status epilepticus because of the "focal" sharply contoured repetitive pattern. During percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), an 88-year-old developed ventricular tachycardia followed by ventricular fibrillation requiring chest compressions for 10 min, multiple defibrillations, and treatment with epinephrine, amiodarone, calcium, bicarbonate, and magnesium. The patient had an Impella placed during PCI with therapeutic hypothermia initiated after the cardiopulmonary arrest. His neurological exam demonstrated preserved pupillary, corneal, gag and cough reflexes and spontaneous respirations.
Long-term video EEG monitoring is included in our institution's hypothermia protocol. Initial baseline EEG performed 2 h after PCI showed a persistent rhythmic sharp discharge from the left central temporal region resembling left hemisphere status epilepticus. The sharp waves have an alternating repeating 2:1 relationship with the EKG rhythm strip. This is best seen in the left hemisphere, which we posit is related to the Impella's positioning across the aortic valve pointing toward the patient's left side. A chest x-ray confirmed the device's position immediately before EEG monitoring. Arterial pressure tracings were not available in the chart.
There is a low-amplitude spiky artifact; however, there was no pacing at that time. It is possible that synergistic flow with systole/diastole reinforced the pulsatility with movement of the Impella, resulting in the alternating pattern. The patient's hemodynamic instability precluded extensive troubleshooting with the Impella device, but after EEG repositioning, the artifact was eliminated.

Abstract: Amiodarone is a highly effective treatment for supraventricular and ventricular tachyarrhythmia; however, it could be associated with several serious adverse effects, including liver injury.
We report the clinical and histological features of two contrasting Japanese patients with amiodarone-induced reversible and irreversible hepatotoxicity. One patient with amiodarone-induced irreversible hepatotoxicity showed liver cirrhosis during treatment with amiodarone and died of hepatic failure; the other patient, who had reversible hepatotoxicity, showed a reversible course of liver function and imaging after discontinuation of amiodarone.
We emphasize the importance of close monitoring of liver enzymes and evaluation of liver computed tomographic imaging as well as liver biopsy during treatment with amiodarone, and discontinuation should be considered when amiodarone-induced hepatotoxicity is suspected.

Abstract: Amiodarone is a widely used antiarrhythmic agent for supraventricular and ventricular tachyarrhythmias. It is known to cause pulmonary toxicity, which can manifest in a variety of presentations, ranging from asymptomatic to fatal. We present a case of chronic interstitial pneumonia with organizing pneumonia induced by amiodarone that was successfully treated with drug cessation and use of corticosteroids. The patient experienced complete resolution of symptoms and full recovery of lung function after the course of steroids.

Abstract: We describe the case of a 67-year-old man presenting with ventricular tachycardia (VT) and systolic heart failure secondary to a left adrenal phaeochromocytoma. After treatment with amiodarone, the patient's VT resolved. However, his course was complicated by femoral deep venous thrombosis secondary to an incidentally discovered dedifferentiated liposarcoma of the thigh, for which he was prescribed a course of enoxaparin. The patient was discharged with plans for adrenalectomy following achievement of sufficient preoperative heart rate and blood pressure control with alpha-adrenergic receptor blockade, but re-presented to an outside facility in haemorrhagic shock, where he ultimately expired. Autopsy determined his death to be caused by spontaneous haemorrhage of the phaeochromocytoma. Cardiac manifestations, complications and oncological associations of phaeochromocytoma are discussed.

Abstract: We present the case of a previously healthy 42-year-old man who attended the emergency department due to a sudden onset of rapid and regular palpitations. The ECG showed 190 bpm, wide QRS with left bundle branch block tachycardia. He was started on amiodarone with progression to 230 bpm, wide QRS tachycardia with multiple morphologies, followed by spontaneous conversion to sinus rhythm, normal PR interval and rS pattern in LIII. The echocardiogram was negative for structural heart disease. The electrophysiological study demonstrated the presence of an accessory pathway with anterograde decremental conduction and no retrograde conduction. Both episodes of clinical tachycardia were induced. A diagnosis of Mahaim fiber-mediated antidromic atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia and pre-excited atrial fibrillation was made. Mapping was performed with detection of an M potential (His-like) at the lateral region of the tricuspid ring followed by radiofrequency ablation with immediate success criteria. Post-ablation there was a change to a qR pattern in LIII. At 12-months follow-up there was no recurrence of the tachycardia.

Abstract: A sofosbuvir/ledipasvir combination is part of a first-line treatment of hepatitis C. However, in patients concurrently treated with amiodarone, cardiac side effects have been described, resulting in an official warning in 2015 by the American Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency when combining those substances. This deprived numerous hepatitis C patients with concurrent cardiovascular problems of receiving this highly effective treatment. Here we present a treatment alternative with an elbasvir/grazoprevir regimen, based on our successful treatment of a patient under concurrent amiodarone therapy. Our observations indicate that patients treated with amiodarone can finally benefit from effective antiviral therapy.

Abstract: Amiodarone is one of the most commonly prescribed antiarrhythmic agents in clinical practice owing to its efficacy, even with high toxicity profile. The high iodine content and the prolonged biological half-life of the drug can result in thyroid dysfunction in a high proportion of patients treated with amiodarone even after cessation of amiodarone. Both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism are common side effects that mandate regular monitoring of patients with thyroid function tests. Amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism (AIH) is diagnosed and managed in the same way as a usual case of hypothyroidism. However, differential diagnosis and clinical management of amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) subtypes can be challenging. With the aid of a case snippet, we update the current evidence for the diagnostic work up and management of patients with amiodarone-induced thyroid dysfunction in this article.

Abstract: Amiodarone is a widely used medication for controlling various types of cardiac arrhythmias. Nonetheless, it carries several known adverse effects that may preclude its use or necessitate discontinuation. Hyponatremia resulting from amiodarone is rarely reported, and its incidence is unknown. We present a case of severe hyponatremia secondary to amiodarone therapy and a review of the literature.

Abstract: Ventricular arrhythmias occurs in 20-50% of patients supported with left ventricular assist devices (LVAD). Ventricular arrhythmias are well tolerated with LVAD support but long-term consequences include worsening right ventricular function. Management of ventricular arrhythmias in LVAD patients includes use of antiarrhythmic agents or ablation. Amiodarone has been used a first-line agent to treat ventricular arrhythmias post-LVAD implantation. Chronic treatment with amiodarone for arrhythmias can result in hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism in 5-10% of patients. Hyperthyroidism is known to cause endothelial dysfunction, alterations in coagulation, and fibrinolytic pathways favoring hypercoagulable state. We describe two cases of left ventricular assist device (LVAD) thrombosis potentiated by amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism (AIT) and discuss pathophysiological mechanisms for hypercoagulable state induced by hyperthyroidism.

Abstract: Amiodarone is a drug which frequently causes elevated transaminases. However, acute liver failure has been rarely reported. Here, we present a case of fatal acute liver failure following the administration of intravenous amiodarone. It is important to be aware of this rare but potentially fatal complication of intravenous amiodarone so that it can be withdrawn immediately at the first sign of hepatic impairment.

Abstract: Yew leaves poisoning is a rare life-threatening intoxication, whose diagnosis can be difficult. Initial symptoms are nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dizziness, tachycardia, muscle weakness, confusion, beginning within 1 hr from ingestion and followed by bradycardia, ventricular arrhythmias, ventricular fibrillation, severe hypotension, and death. Taxine-derived alkaloids are responsible for the toxicity of the yew leaves, blocking sodium and calcium channels, and causing conduction abnormalities. Because of lack of a specific antidote and limited efficacy of common antiarrhythmic drugs, prompt diagnosis, detoxification measures, and immediate hemodynamic support (also with transvenous cardiac stimulation) are essential.

Abstract: The authors present a case of a 69-year-old man with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy controlled with amiodarone and an infected orthopedic prosthesis requiring treatment with rifampicin. This combination involves a pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction leading to subtherapeutic drug concentrations of amiodarone and its active metabolite. The long half-life of amiodarone and its active metabolite in combination with the late onset and offset of cytochrome P4503A (CYP3A4) induction by rifampicin makes this a challenging drug-drug interaction to cope with in clinical practice. Before, during, and after rifampicin treatment, the serum concentrations of amiodarone and its active metabolite were measured and the amiodarone dose was adjusted accordingly. The amiodarone dose required to maintain effective concentrations was 450% of the initial dose. The drug-drug interaction between amiodarone and rifampicin is relevant, both clinically and pharmacokinetically, and can be managed by dose adjustments of amiodarone based on serum concentrations.

Abstract: Curing hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in patients harbouring multiple severe comorbidities is a medical challenge. Evidence-based data are lacking regarding HCV treatment with direct-acting antiviral regimens in particular populations of HCV/HIV-coinfected patients with cirrhosis and chronic kidney disease on haemodialysis. Here, we present the HCV treatment challenges facing a patient with HIV coinfection, prior failure of both HIV-1 and HCV therapy, cirrhosis, end-stage renal failure on haemodialysis, as well as management of drug-drug interactions, especially given the need to receive long-term amiodarone therapy.

Abstract: Amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) type 2, characterized as a destructive thyroiditis, is well described in the medical literature; however, iodine-induced thyrotoxicosis (IIT) is not, though the latter has similar features and can be managed similarly.
We present a 17-year-old female who presented with a history of an intermittent goiter with thyroid function tests (TFTs): thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)<0.015 (0.4-4 μU/mL), free thyroxine (T4)≥6 (0.7-2.1 ng/dL) and total triiodothyronine (T3) 651 (50-200 mg/dL). Thyroid antibodies were all negative. Despite methimazole therapy for 6 weeks, hyperthyroidism proved refractory to medical management. 123I scan uptake was suppressed. With hyperthyroidism being recalcitrant to therapy, a nutritional history revealed consumption of an iodine supplement containing at least 7 times the recommended daily allowance (RDA) for 5 years, contributing to the Jod-Basedow phenomenon. Urinary spot and 24-hour urinary iodine were both elevated. Though a surgical consult was obtained, surgery was cancelled once TFTs improved and then normalized with steroid therapy. The TFTs and urinary iodine levels remained normal post steroid therapy.
We suggest that in addition to the need for a thorough nutritional history, a trial of corticosteroids should be utilized in the management of IIT which can present with findings similar to AIT type 2 which is recalcitrant to thionamide therapy. If successful, corticosteroids may delay or prevent surgical management thus avoiding possible complications with the latter approach.

Abstract: A 59-year-old woman with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) presented with severe non-productive cough, malaise, low-grade fever and AF flare-up 3 weeks following pulmonary vein isolation with radiofrequency catheter ablation. She denied chest pain or dyspnoea. Patient was haemodynamically stable. There was no pulsus paradoxus. Laboratories showed leucocytosis and elevated C-reactive protein. ECG showed sinus tachycardia. CT abdomen and pelvis showed a large pericardial effusion (PE). Shortly after admission, she developed AF with rapid ventricular response, responsive to intravenous amiodarone. Transthoracic echocardiogram revealed 2.4 cm posterior PE without tamponade physiology, non-amenable to pericardiocentesis via sub-xiphoid approach. Patient underwent left thoracoscopic pericardial window with removal of 250 cc bloody fibrinous fluid. Cough improved significantly and she was discharged on oral amiodarone and apixaban. Repeat CT chest after 2 weeks for recurrent cough showed a small PE, treated with oral prednisone for suspected postablation pericarditis, with complete resolution of cough. Amiodarone was stopped without recurrence of AF.

Abstract: Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) are of great concern in the treatment of cancer, especially when target therapies, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors, are being used. Here, we report a case of probable DDI between erlotinib and amiodarone leading to severe neurotoxicity. Amiodarone inhibits P-glycoprotein (P-gp), for which erlotinib is a substrate. P-gp is an important drug transporter that is involved in limiting the blood-brain barrier penetration of erlotinib. Clinicians should be aware of emerging data characterizing the effect of the P-gp transport system on drug exposure and its potential for DDI.

Abstract: Electrical storm (ES) represents a critical state of electrical instability. We describe a patient with coronary artery disease, mechanical aortic valve replacement, and reduced left ventricular function with recurrent ICD shocks. Despite medical treatment with beta-blocker and amiodarone, and after successful ablation of different VT morphologies in combination with substrate modification, ES could not be controlled. We performed renal denervation (RDN) to reduce arrhythmic burden. Thereafter, patient remained free from sustained and non-sustained VTs at 6-month follow-up. RDN is an effective second-line treatment option in patients in whom conventional catheter ablation and medical treatment failed to control the VTs.

Abstract: BACKGROUND Left bundle branch block (LBBB) is associated with atrial fibrillation (AF) and systolic heart failure, which can be treated with cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) that includes an implantable cardiac device (ICD). However, in some patients, LBBB may vary with heart rate, and during episodes of AF in LBBB, aberrant ventricular conduction, or wide QRS complex tachycardia (Ashman beats) can occur. This report is a case of LBBB treated with pharmacologic CRT, without the use of an ICD. CASE REPORT A 68-year-old man presented with persistent AF and systolic heart failure. Serial electrocardiograms (ECGs) showed AF and mixed narrow (116 ms) and wide (152 ms) QRS duration of LBBB. Echocardiography showed a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 30%. Catheter ablation for AF resulted in the restoration of sinus rhythm. The patient was treated with step-wise decreasing doses of amiodarone, from 200 mg to 75 mg daily, and step-wise increasing doses of bisoprolol, from 3.75 mg to 5.0 mg daily, which effectively slowed heart rate, inhibited aberrant cardiac conduction due to LBBB, reduced the symptoms of heart failure, and improved LVEF to 60%, despite persistent sinus bradycardia and the inability of the heart rate to increase during activity (chronotropic incompetence). CONCLUSIONS This report of a case of AF associated with LBBB shows that pharmacologic CRT can restore sinus rhythm following catheter ablation and can reduce heart rate and treat heart failure without the use of an ICD.

Abstract: ABSTRACTSustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) can result in hypoperfusion or devolve into more dangerous rhythms such as ventricular fibrillation. In an unstable patient with VT and a pulse, synchronized cardioversion is the first-line treatment. When the VT is refractory to standard cardioversion, the next step is to add an antiarrhythmic, such as amiodarone, that carries with it the risk of lowering blood pressure in the already hypotensive patient. Here we describe a case of double sequential synchronized cardioversion of a patient with unstable VT refractory to standard direct current cardioversion, resulting in a rapid conversion to sinus rhythm and return to hemodynamic stability. The benefit of this technique is that it may obviate the need for rapid infusion of medications, such as amiodarone, in the acute setting that may worsen hypotension in the already unstable patient.

Abstract: Amiodarone is an effective medication used in the treatment of several different arrhythmias. Its most well-known adverse effects include pulmonary fibrosis, thyroid dysfunction, and hepatotoxicity. A less common side effect is acute pancreatitis. A 67-year-old male being treated for atrial fibrillation in rapid ventricular response with Amiodarone developed acute epigastric abdominal pain 24 hours after initiation of therapy. He was diagnosed as having acute pancreatitis based on characteristic findings seen on an abdominal CT scan. Commonly encountered etiologies of pancreatitis were ruled out through a combination of the history, laboratory values, and imaging results. Based on the temporal association of the acute presentation and initiation of Amiodarone therapy, in conjunction with a lack of support for any other etiology, the diagnosis of Amiodarone-induced pancreatitis was made. Within 7 days following the cessation of Amiodarone therapy, the patient's symptoms had completely resolved. Amiodarone-induced pancreatitis is an often overlooked medication association and is one that has been infrequently reported throughout the literature. Given the substantial morbidity and mortality associated with acute pancreatitis, and the ease of treatment (withdrawing Amiodarone), this is a critical side effect that should be recognized in the appropriate clinical setting.

Abstract: Intravenous sotalol has been available for many years outside of the United States, but has only recently become available in the US. The safety and feasibility of intravenous sotalol for the prevention of recurrent atrial fibrillation following bypass surgery has not been described. The present case study is of a patient with several other co-morbidities undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery, who post-operatively developed atrial fibrillation. The patient received intravenous sotalol and was then transitioned to oral sotalol. The patient remained hemodynamically stable, with normal QTc and without further atrial fibrillation or tachyarrhythmias in the post-operative period until discharge. Intravenous sotalol is a reasonable alternative to intravenous amiodarone in the post bypass surgery patient with better tolerability and safety profile.

Abstract: Drug-induced prolongation of the corrected QT interval (QTc) may lead to serious and potentially life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmia, such as torsades de pointes (Tdp), which is worthy of clinical attention. Here, we report 1 case of Tdp after a coadministration of fluoxetine and amiodarone.
A 62-year-old Chinese male who placed with the implanted cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) appeared the QTc prolongation and Tdp after the concurrent administration of fluoxetine and amiodarone.
Torsades de pointes (Tdp).
The patient was treated with magnesium and potassium immediately. Her ICD-brady pacing mode was reprogrammed to 90 bpm. Meanwhile, both of fluoxetine and amiodarone were discontinued.
The further episodes of Tdp were prevented. After a few days, the QTc gradually decreased without clinically significant arrhythmias.
The present case demonstrates that a potential drug-drug interaction (DDI) may lead to a life-threatening drug adverse reaction (ADR) especially in special subjects. Therefore, clinicians should closely monitor the electrocardiogram (ECG) when QTc-prolonging agents are given to patients with cardiac abnormalities, and avoid combining 2 QTc-prolonging drugs.

Abstract: An 11-year-old male child with fractures in both bones in his left forearm presented for open reduction and internal fixation. The pre-anesthetic check-up and investigations did not reveal any pre-existing underlying cardio-respiratory disease. The patient had an uneventful peri-operative period during the operation and was comfortable without any anxiety or restlessness. After an uneventful induction and intubation as per routine protocol, the patient received 600 mg of amoxicillin+clavunate intravenously as an antibiotic. After 3 min, the patient developed persistent ventricular bigeminy with intermittent sinus rhythm, which returned to normal after 20 min. Open reduction and internal fixation of the fractures in both bones were done. Extubation and the post-op course were uneventful. To rule out the cause of arrhythmia, ECG, 2D-ECHO and serum electrolyte evaluation were done, however the results came back as normal. Many days later, the patient fell again on the same arm and revisited the ortho operation theatre for revision surgery. As the child was very cooperative and calm, he was given a supraclavicular block after proper counseling. Thirty minutes before tourniquet inflation as a routine method, 600 mg of amoxicillin+clavunate was administered. After 5 min, the patient developed persistent ventricular bigeminy. After 1 h, the child complained of chest pain and had redness of eyes and was restless. This was managed with 100% oxygen and an injection of 150 mg amiodarone intravenously. Surgery was postponed for further stabilization and optimization. Serum electrolytes were normal. The child was observed in the surgical intensive care unit with continuous ECG monitoring. Ventricular bigeminy with intermittent sinus rhythm persisted for 3 days. This was managed with metoprolol 12.5 mg BD and amiodarone 100 mg OD tablets. The opinion of a pediatric cardiologist was obtained and repeated 2D-ECHO results revealed no abnormality. After 5 days, the patient was discharged and surgery was rescheduled for 2 weeks later with continuation of metaprolol and amiodarone tablets. On the fourth occasion we avoided the injection of amoxicillin+clavunate and all anesthetic drugs, which might contribute to cardiac arrhythmia. The peri-operative period was uneventful. An in-depth discussion of the case and ventricular dysrhythmias in the pediatric population is emphasized in this case report.

Abstract: A 30-year-old male was presented to the Emergency Department (ED) by the Emergency Medical Services (EMS). He was found unconscious but breathing normally, and had a seizure for more than 30 minutes. He was no previous history of systemic disease, previous operation, medication and any known allergy. According to the witnesses, he was alone in the coffee shop, and besides him was a lighter refill canister containing 250 ml extra purified butane gas, and he suddenly collapsed and had seizure. Six hours later, he developed ventricular fibrillation and he was not responding to amiodarone infusion, and 4 times defibrillation and cardioversion. He died after 45 minutes of resuscitation.

Abstract: A 43-year-old man was referred to our hospital in June 2014 because of severe heart failure. He was diagnosed with familial dilated cardiomyopathy and was administered oral tolvaptan and amiodarone for atrial and ventricular tachycardia. Since up-titration of carvedilol had failed and he was dependent on dobutamine, a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) was implanted. Tolvaptan and furosemide were both discontinued after LVAD implantation and he was discharged from the hospital. Thirteen months later, he was hospitalized for lethargy and hyponatremia of 108 mEq/L, with an antidiuretic hormone level of 2.5 pg/mL, which suggested syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). We discontinued amiodarone and administered fludrocortisones. However, hyponatremia persisted for a few more days, eventually resulting in delirium and damage to the LVAD driveline. He received an urgent pump exchange and hyponatremia was gradually improved. We considered the possibility that amiodarone-induced SIADH was masked by tolvaptan therapy before LVAD implantation.

Abstract: Amiodarone is widely used to prevent ventricular and supraventricular dysrhythmias but has a number of toxicities. One of the most devastating adverse reactions to this drug is pulmonary toxicity, which can present in a myriad of different ways. Toxicity is difficult to diagnose because many of its features also are seen in nontoxic patients. This article reviews the pathophysiology, presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity.

Abstract: An elderly man was transferred to our emergency department with reported ventricular tachycardia requiring intravenous amiodarone and intensive care unit admission. Device interrogation, the following day, revealed only frequent premature ventricular contractions and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia in a patient with a known history of these conditions. The patient underwent unnecessary invasive monitoring after being emergently transferred to our facility and admitted to the intensive care unit. Fortunately, our patient did not suffer any unwarranted side effects from intravenous amiodarone. This case reports on some negative consequences of inappropriate intensive care unit admissions and how they could have been avoided.

Abstract: Implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICD) are capable of effectively terminating malignant ventricular arrhythmia and are the most effective way to prevent sudden cardiac death. However, some evidences demonstrated that both anti-tachycardia pacing (ATP) and ICD shock can also bring adverse prognosis.
A 66-year-old Han Chinese man with prior ICD implantation was admitted to our hospital because of frequent ICD shocks. Although intravenous amiodarone and esmolol succinate were administered daily, the patient suffered 155 episodes of VT/VF during 8 weeks after implantation. After repeated discharge of the device, the pacing threshold of the patient increased gradually. Considering the inappropriate increase of the pacing threshold, we decided to reposition the right ventricular (RV) lead with good sensing and threshold parameters confirmed. Subsequent 22 months interrogation follow-up revealed a stable lead position and electrical specifications. Furthermore, antiarrhythmic drugs were maximally increased, while ATP burst was remarkably decreased and the inappropriate ICD shock never occurred until now.
An inappropriate pacing threshold was increased secondary to repeated ICD electrical storm. A timely active lead position adjustment reduced the pacing threshold and eliminated the risk of premature battery depletion.

Abstract: We describe a case of amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) with cardiopulmonary arrest (CPA) in a 49-year-old woman. The patient had been treated with amiodarone for non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. Two weeks prior to her admission, she developed thyrotoxicosis and prednisolone (PSL, 30 mg daily) was administered with the continuation of amiodarone. However, she was admitted to our hospital for CPA. We performed total thyroidectomy to control her thyrotoxicosis and the pathological findings were consistent with type 2 AIT. She gradually improved and was discharged on day 84. This case demonstrates the importance of considering immediate total thyroidectomy for patients with uncontrollable AIT.

Abstract: The case of a patient who experienced extravasation while receiving amiodarone via a peripheral infusion and was treated with intradermal hyaluronidase is reported.
A 60-year-old Caucasian man arrived at the emergency department after a motor vehicle collision. The patient was noted to have a subdural hematoma, multiple rib fractures, sternal body fracture, abdominal wall injury, left clavicle fracture, right humerus fracture, and vertebral fractures. His medical history included hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and stroke with residual right-sided weakness. On postoperative day 1, the patient developed atrial fibrillation and was started on i.v. amiodarone. Treatment resulted in conversion to sinus rhythm, but the patient again developed atrial fibrillation on postoperative day 5. During the morning hours of postoperative day 6, the patient experienced a peripheral i.v. line extravasation of amiodarone in his left arm. The amiodarone drip was discontinued, and amiodarone 400 mg orally twice daily was started. The nursing staff was instructed to treat the patient for the amiodarone extravasation with traditional nonpharmacologic measures, including warm compresses and elevation of the extremity. After extravasation, the patient reported severe pain at the site. Due to the patient's continued complaints of pain and the expanding area of induration, the interdisciplinary team elected to proceed with intradermal hyaluronidase. The patient reported significantly decreased pain and was discharged to inpatient rehabilitation on postoperative day 10 without any significant adverse effects.
Administration of intradermal hyaluronidase after amiodarone extravasation was associated with decreased expansion of erythema and warmth as well as an improvement in patient-reported pain scores without any noted adverse effects.

Abstract: A 73-year-old male on home peritoneal dialysis (PD) with recent diagnosis of atrial fibrillation presented with fatigue and dyspnea. Hyperthyroidism was diagnosed with TSH < 0.01 mIU/L and FT4 > 100 pmol/L. He had no personal or family history of thyroid disease. There had been no exposures to CT contrast, amiodarone, or iodine. Technetium thyroid scan showed diffusely decreased uptake. He was discharged with a presumptive diagnosis of thyroiditis. Three weeks later, he had deteriorated clinically. Possible iodine sources were again reviewed, and it was determined that povidone-iodine solution was used with each PD cycle. Methimazole 25 mg daily was initiated; however, he had difficulty tolerating the medication and continued to clinically deteriorate. He was readmitted to hospital where methimazole was restarted at 20 mg bid with high dose prednisone 25 mg and daily plasma exchange (PLEX) therapy. Biochemical improvement was observed with FT4 dropping to 48.5 pmol/L by day 10, but FT4 rebounded to 67.8 pmol/L after PLEX was discontinued. PLEX was restarted and thyroidectomy was performed. Pathology revealed nodular hyperplasia with no evidence of thyroiditis. Preoperative plasma iodine levels were greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal range. We hypothesize that the patient had underlying autonomous thyroid hormone production exacerbated by exogenous iodine exposure from a previously unreported PD-related source.

Abstract: We describe the case of a 24-year-old male with hyper-IgE syndrome (HIES) which was diagnosed at 4 years of age and died from a very rare cardiac complication. He had typical clinical and laboratory manifestations of HIES, including total serum IgE as high as > 100,000 IU/mL. Stem cell transplantation was not available. During the 20-year follow-up, he suffered numerous various infections of the skin and deep organs, partial lung resection, as well as multiple bone fractures. At age 24, he developed acute decompensated heart failure associated with elevated serum troponin I and brain natriuretic protein. Two-dimensional echocardiogram revealed global hypokinesis of the left ventricle with estimated ejection fraction 20-25%, and catheterization revealed ectasia of multiple coronary arteries. Endomyocardial biopsy showed lymphocytic myocarditis, focal necrosis, mild fibrosis, and myxoid degeneration, but cultures were negative. The patient improved on corticosteroid therapy and was discharged on heart failure therapy and external defibrillator. Six weeks later, he developed supraventricular tachycardia and persistent global hypokinesis and was treated with amiodarone. A trial of intravenous immunoglobulin was initiated and was repeated as outpatient every four weeks for four times. However, his cardiac function did not improve and he developed severe hypotension and pulseless electrical activity arrest. Resuscitation was unsuccessful. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of HIES complicated with lymphocytic myocarditis. Both immunologists and cardiologists need to be aware of such a complication and practice caution in using immunosuppressants when the patient's immune status is markedly compromised.

Abstract: Lightning strike is a rare medical emergency. The primary cause of death in lightning strike victims is immediate cardiac arrest. The mortality rate from lightning exposure can be as high as 30%, with up to 70% of patients left with significant morbidity.
An 86-year-old male was struck by lightning while driving his vehicle and crashed. On initial emergency medical services evaluation, he was asymptomatic with normal vital signs. During his transport, he lost consciousness several times and was found to be in atrial fibrillation with intermittent runs of ventricular tachycardia during the unconscious periods. In the emergency department, atrial fibrillation persisted and he experienced additional episodes of ventricular tachycardia. He was treated with i.v. amiodarone and admitted to cardiovascular intensive care unit, where he converted to a normal sinus rhythm on the amiodarone drip. He was discharged home without rhythm-control medications and did not have further episodes of dysrhythmias on follow-up visits. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: Lightning strikes are one of the most common injuries suffered from natural phenomenon, and short-term mortality ordinarily depends on the cardiac effects. This case demonstrates that the cardiac effects can be multiple, delayed, and recurrent, which compels the emergency physician to be vigilant in the initial evaluation and ongoing observation of patients with lightning injuries.

Abstract: Myocardial infarctions are frequently complicated by tachyarrhythmias, which commonly have wide QRS complexes (QRS duration > 120 milliseconds). Many published criteria exist to help differentiate between ventricular and supraventricular mechanisms. We present a case of a 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia and coronary artery disease with prior stenting of the right coronary artery (RCA). He had been noncompliant with his antiplatelet medication and presented with cardiac arrest secondary to in-stent thrombosis. He was resuscitated and his RCA was re-stented, after which he made a good neurological recovery. During cardiac rehabilitation several weeks post-intervention, he was noted to have sustained tachycardia with associated nausea and lightheadedness, but no palpitation symptoms, chest pain or loss of consciousness. He was sent to the emergency department, where his electrocardiogram showed a tachycardia at 173 beats per minute which was regular, with a relatively narrow QRS duration (maximum of 115-120 msec in leads I and AVL) with a slurred QRS upstroke. This morphology was significantly different from his QRS complex during sinus rhythm. Intravenous diltiazem was ineffective but an amiodarone bolus terminated the tachycardia. The patient was admitted to the coronary care unit and treated with intravenous amiodarone infusion. A subsequent electrophysiology study was performed, showing inducibility of the clinical tachycardia. Atrioventricular (AV) dissociation was present during the induced arrhythmia, confirming the diagnosis of ventricular tachycardia. An implantable cardiac defibrillator was placed and the patient was discharged.

Abstract: We describe a neonate born with complex arrhythmias that included concurrent atrial and ventricular tachycardias. Genetic testing demonstrated a mutation in the TTN gene, which codes for titin, a large protein found in striated muscle sarcomeres. The complex arrhythmias were successfully treated with amiodarone and flecainide. The patient remains asymptomatic with normal biventricular function. We speculate that the complex arrhythmias and TTN gene mutation may be related.

Abstract: To report a case of amiodarone-induced vortex keratopathy-associated anatomical findings and subjective visual perception before and after treatment with topical heparin eye drops.
Case report.
A 76-year-old man complained of halos in his vision in both his eyes due to prominent bilateral cornea verticillata. For treatment of cornea verticillata, we prescribed unpreserved eye drops of a sterile, phosphate-free solution of 0.1% sodium hyaluronate with 1300 IU/mL heparin sodium 3 times daily to the left eye, whereas the other side served as the control. The area of corneal deposits was measured by 2 examiners before and at the 1- and 3-month examination. At last follow-up, cornea verticillata had been reduced from 6 to 2 mm in area by approximately 66% from grade-III to grade-II amiodarone keratopathy.
In patients using amiodarone, clearing of cornea verticillata may be achieved by topical use of unpreserved eye drops of a sterile, phosphate-free solution of 0.1% sodium hyaluronate with 1300 IU/mL heparin sodium.

Abstract: Danon disease is an X-linked disturbance of autophagy manifesting with cognitive impairment and disordered heart and skeletal muscle. After a period of relative stability, patients deteriorate rapidly and may quickly become ineligible for elective heart transplantation - the only life-saving therapy.
We report a large pedigree with diverse manifestations of Danon disease in hemizygotes and female heterozygotes.
Malignant cardiac arrhythmias requiring amiodarone treatment induced thyroid disease in two patients; intractable thyrotoxicosis, which enhances autophagy, caused the death of a 21year-old man. Our patients also had striking elevation of serum troponin I during the accelerated phase of their illness (p<0.01) and rising concentrations heralded cardiac decompensation. We argue for changes to cardiac transplantation eligibility criteria.
Danon disease causes hypertrophic cardiomyopathy - here we propose a common pathophysiological basis for the metabolic and structural effects of this descriptive class of heart disorders. We also contend that troponin I may have prognostic value and merits exploration for clinical decision-making including health warning bracelets. Rapamycin (Sirolimus®), an approved immunosuppressant which also influences autophagy, may prove beneficial. In the interim, while new treatments are developed, a revaluation of cardiac transplantation eligibility criteria is warranted.

Abstract: Amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity (APT) is a severe side effect that can lead to lung fibrosis or fatal respiratory failure. Usually APT occurs during long term therapy after administration of prolonged loading doses or high cumulative doses. We present the case of a 58 year old woman who underwent thoracic surgery with lobe resection. She developed atrial fibrillation with hemodynamic-instability on the first post-operative day. We initiated amiodarone therapy and four days later she developed respiratory failure. The pulmonary function further deteriorated showing signs of an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). We therefore started mechanical ventilation, but still the gas exchange did not improve. A computer tomography-(CT)-scan presented bilateral interstitial and alveolar infiltrations. The patient also presented with leukocytosis, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels however without elevated procalcitonin (PCT) concentrations. In the tracheal secretion we only harvested foam cells, but got no evidence for pathogens causing pneumonia. We immediately started glucocorticoid therapy with prednisolone 50 mg/d for five days. Almost instantaneously the gas exchange ameliorated. We were able to wean the patient from the respirator within five days. Pulmonary infiltrations were nearly vanished in a CT-scan few days later and completely disappeared in follow up examinations. This case demonstrates a per-acute onset of APT caused by a low loading dose in association with thoracic surgery. The initiation of glucocorticoid therapy in parallel to amiodarone withdrawal led to full recovery of the patient. One should consider APT when signs of pulmonary failure occur during brief periods of amiodarone therapy especially after thoracic surgery.

Abstract: Sofosbuvir is a direct-acting antiviral drug used to treat chronic hepatitis C infection. In 2015, Gilead Sciences, the manufacturer of sofosbuvir, warned that bradycardia could occur when sofosbuvir is administered in combination with amiodarone. Interestingly, among the reported cases of patients with sofosbuvir and amiodarone related bradycardia, some of them were also treated with propranolol.
We herein report a case of ventricular extrasystoles within three hours after the coadministration of sofosbuvir-containing regimen with propranolol. This patient had never been treated with amiodarone. After the sofosbuvir-containing regimen was stopped, ventricular extrasystoles disappeared within 24 hours. This observation suggests that the association of sofosbuvir with propranolol may have a role in the emergence of cardiac arrhythmia.
Patients treated with amiodarone and/or propranolol should be continuously monitored within the early hours following the initiation of sofosbuvir.

Abstract: Amiodarone, a commonly used class III antiarrhythmic agent notable for a relatively long half-life of up to 6 months and its pronounced adverse effect profile, is used for both acute and chronic management of cardiac arrhythmias. Chronic use of amiodarone has been associated with asymptomatic hepatotoxicity; however, acute toxicity is thought to be uncommon. There are only six reported cases of acute liver failure (ALF) secondary to amiodarone. In all these cases the outcome of death during the same hospitalization resulted. We aimed to report the only case of acute liver failure secondary to amiodarone infusion in the existing literature where the patient survived.
A 79-year-old woman admitted with atrial flutter was being treated with intravenous (IV) amiodarone when she abruptly developed coagulopathy, altered mental status and liver enzyme derangement. She was diagnosed with acute liver failure (ALF) secondary to an amiodarone adverse drug reaction, with a calculated score of seven on the Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale. Amiodarone was immediately withheld, and N-acetylcysteine (NAC) was initiated. Clinical improvement was seen within 48 hours of holding the drug and within 24 hours of initiating NAC. On post-hospital follow-up visit she was reported to have complete recovery.
This report emphasizes the importance of monitoring liver enzymes and mental status while a patient is being administered IV amiodarone. N-acetylcysteine administration may have possibly contributed to the early and successful recovery from ALF in our patient. To date, she is the only patient in the existing literature who has been reported to survive ALF secondary to amiodarone administration.

Abstract: Sinus bradycardia which is a sinus rhythm with a resting heart rate of less than 60 bpm is caused by intrinsic cardiac disorders like sick sinus syndrome or inferior myocardial infarction, metabolic and environmental causes (such as hypothyroidism and electrolyte disorders), medications (such as beta-blockers and amiodarone), infection (such as myocarditis), increased intracranial pressure, and toxic exposure, while it can sometimes be a normal phenomenon, especially during sleep, in athletes, and during pregnancy. Symptomatic sinus bradycardia should warrant a thorough work-up in order to identify any reversible causes; otherwise, placement of a permanent pacemaker could be needed. We present the case of a patient who was admitted due to confusion and fever and was found to have pneumococcal meningitis and bacteremia, and during his hospital stay he developed symptomatic sinus bradycardia that was of intractable cause and persistent. Placement of a permanent pacemaker was chosen until the night staff of the hospital discovered by chance the neglected cause of his bradycardia.

Abstract: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a fatal neuromuscular disorder characterized by progressive death of the upper and lower motor neurons in the central nervous system. Patients with this disease die mostly as a result of respiratory failure; however, owing to prolonged survival through assisted ventilation, cardiovascular causes are increasingly responsible for mortality. We report what is to the best of our knowledge the first case of type 2 Brugada syndrome causing ventricular tachyarrhythmia and cardiac arrest in a patient with upper limb onset amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
A 48-year-old Caucasian woman with a significant past medical history of papillary thyroid carcinoma status postresection, pulmonary embolism on anticoagulation, and a recent diagnosis of right upper limb-onset amyotrophic lateral sclerosis presented to the emergency department of our hospital with acute on chronic shortness of breath. On further evaluation, she was found to have hypoxic and hypercapnic respiratory failure and was placed on bilevel positive airway pressure ventilation. Her 12-lead electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm with J-point elevation, saddle-shaped ST segment elevation, predominantly in V1 and V2 with no significant QTc prolongation. No troponin elevation was noted in her laboratory workup. Because she was unable to protect her airway, a decision was made to intubate her. After 1 minute of induction with etomidate and succinylcholine, she went into pulseless ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation requiring three cycles of cardiopulmonary resuscitation with high-quality chest compressions, three doses of epinephrine, and a loading dose of amiodarone prior to return of spontaneous circulation. She was further evaluated by cardiology services and was diagnosed with type 2 Brugada syndrome, for which she was started on quinidine. Her respiratory failure and the drugs she received for intubation likely caused her ventricular tachycardia to occur in conjunction with an underlying Brugada pattern seen on an electrocardiogram. The results of evaluation of her genetic panel for Brugada syndrome were negative. She was subsequently discharged to home in stable condition after a 10-day hospital stay.
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a progressive neuromuscular disorder with significant mortality. Respiratory failure is the leading cause of death, but lately, owing to increased survival associated with early tracheostomy and positive pressure ventilation, there has been an increasing trend in the identification of cardiovascular causes of mortality, especially arrhythmias, that may need periodic electrocardiographic surveillance.

Abstract: The onset of recurrent atrial tachyarrhythmia (ATA) following the Cox maze procedure (CMP) is commonly encountered, and may be associated with increased perioperative mortality. The majority of recurrent ATA cases are localized to the left atrium following surgical ablation. Right atrial flutter (AFL) following the CMP is a less-frequent occurrence, and may pose a diagnostic challenge due to uncharacteristic surface electrocardiogram (ECG) and intracardiac activation patterns. In this case, a 68-year-old male who had previously undergone left-sided surgical ablation with left atrial reduction for the treatment of persistent atrial fibrillation during coronary artery bypass and mitral valve repair developed symptomatic atypical AFL. The patient was intolerant to amiodarone, and was thus scheduled for ablation. Given the patient's history of extensive left atrial instrumentation and surface ECG findings indicating an atypical AFL, the decision was made to proceed with left atrial mapping. During the electrophysiology study, initial activation mapping was not suggestive of a cavotricuspid isthmus reentrant arrhythmia. Here, we describe the possible mapping pitfalls associated with a persistent tachyarrhythmia that was ultimately proven to be a right AFL, despite atypical activation patterns.

Abstract: Electrical ventricular separation, as a special complete intraventricular block, denotes that ventricles be electrically separated into two or more parts caused by severe and wide damage of myocardium and conduction. Electrical ventricular separation can be divided into homologous and heterologous, homologous electrical ventricular separation is a rare phenomenon, literally the excitement of whole ventricle originate from supraventricle, on ECG, there are two different QRS waves which connect with an isoelectric line, one ST segment and T wave. We report a valve heart disease presented with complicated electrophysiological characteristics, which has reversed complex homologous electrical ventricular separation with second degree intraventricular block.

Abstract: The study aims to describe the management of a case of life-threatening yew (Taxus baccata) intoxication.
The needles of the yew tree contain highly cardiotoxic taxines. Intoxication with taxines, typically as part of suicide attempts, may lead to potentially lethal arrhythmias which often require prolonged cardiopulmonary resuscitation and other supportive measures. No specific therapy has been described. In some cases, extracorporeal life support has been used.
After an attempted suicide with yew needles and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, a female adolescent was resuscitated for 6 hours according to Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support guidelines. Complex ventricular tachycardias were treated by repeated direct current shocks and broad complex bradycardia managed with transvenous cardiac pacing. Antiarrhythmic drugs (amiodarone, lidocaine), magnesium sulfate, and supportive measures (intravenous lipids, sodium bicarbonate) were provided. The arrhythmias finally resolved, and the patient did not show any significant neurological or cardiac short-term sequelae after 24 hours.
The authors describe the successful management of a case of severe taxine intoxication by prolonged conventional advanced cardiac life support lasting for more than 6 hours.
In life-threatening yew intoxication, prolonged cardiopulmonary resuscitation is absolutely essential owing to the long duration of the cardiotoxic action of taxines and can lead to an outcome without cardiac or neurological sequelae.

Abstract: Amiodarone is an antiarrhythmic agent which is commonly used to treat both supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias. This iodine containing compound has been associated with several adverse events like it tends to accumulate in several organs. Among those, the most serious is Amiodarone Pulmonary Toxicity (APT). While the incidence of this complication has decreased with the use of lower doses of amiodarone but it can occur with any dose. Pulmonary complications usually present as an acute or subacute pneumonitis. On chest X-ray and high-resolution Computed Tomography (CT), diffuse infiltrates were found. Here, we present a case in which acute respiratory distress syndrome like features were detected which got subsided after stopping tablet amiodarone. The patient was a known case of atrial fibrillation for which she was taking tablet amiodarone for the last six months.

Abstract: Amiodarone is still the most potent antiarrhythmic drug in the prevention of life threatening ventricular arrhythmias and demonstrates a very low incidence of torsade de pointes. An unusual case of an 81-year-old woman who developed serious abnormalities of the conduction system of the heart and torsade des pointes during intravenous infusion of amiodarone for the treatment of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is described. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case showing an association of intravenous amiodarone-induced third degree atrioventricular block and extreme QT interval prolongation generating torsade des pointes in a patient with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation who required an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator. Currently, amiodarone is still one of the few remaining treatment options for the medical therapeutic management of serious ventricular arrhythmias and to reduce the incidence of atrial fibrillation without increasing mortality or sudden cardiac death rates in heart failure patients like our elderly present patient. Nevertheless, we have to keep in mind that intravenous amiodarone may generate serious abnormalities of the conduction system of the heart and lethal ventricular arrhythmias in certain patients.

Abstract: A 66-year-old male patient was referred to our clinic with severe pneumonia. Bronchoscopy was performed due to clinical worsening despite antibiotics and diuretic therapy, respiratory failure and radiographic progression. Because bacterial cultures of the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were negative and after using amiodarone for almost one month, we eliminated amiodarone from his medication regimen due to suspicion of amiodarone toxicity. Accordingly, we also initiated systemic steroid therapy. Chest X-ray done after 72 hours showed a significant resolution of lung consolidations and the patient exhibited significant clinical improvement, with decline of his oxygen requirements.

Abstract: Ventricular tachycardia is a life threatening cardiac arrhythmia. It needs management with defibrillation, without which, immediate death may occur.
A 66 year old black African patient with a 2 year history of hypertension was admitted to the emergency department of the Buea Regional hospital, a semi-urban setting in Cameroon, after presenting with syncope while in church. The wife described a similar episode 2 weeks prior without any further evaluation. Upon arrival at the emergency, patient had regained consciousness but lethargic, tachypneic and diaphoretic. The blood pressure was 85/61 mmHg; the pulse was 219/min, weak and thready. He had cold extremities. A 12 lead electrocardiogram performed showed a sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia at 230/min. He was administered six tablets of amiodarone, oxygen by nasal cannula and intravenous fluids. No electrical cardioversion was attempted due to the non availability of a defibrillator. Outcome was fatal with death of the patient 30 min after his arrival to the emergency.
Our health facilities should be well equipped for resuscitative measures by adopting Advanced Cardiac Life Support as cardiovascular diseases are becoming more frequent in our settings.

Abstract: A best evidence topic in thoracic surgery was written according to a structured protocol. The question addressed was whether the administration of amiodarone is safe in patients undergoing lung resection either for prophylaxis or treatment of de novo postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF). A total of 30 papers were identified, of which 13 represented the best evidence to answer the clinical question. The authors, journal, date, study type, country of publication, patient demographics, relevant outcomes and results were tabulated. Among the identified papers, there were 2 meta-analyses, 1 best evidence topic and 3 randomized studies, while the remainder were retrospective. When considering perioperative amiodarone for the prophylaxis of POAF, 3 randomized studies reported no significantly increased postoperative complications or amiodarone-related side effects. Mortality and length of hospital stay were similar in patients receiving amiodarone compared with either no amiodarone or other prophylactic antiarrhythmic medication. When considering amiodarone for the treatment of POAF, 1 study reported a significantly increased incidence of ARDS after anatomical lung resection (P < 0.001). Two case series reported that patients developing POAF after lung resection and managed with amiodarone also had either none or acceptable rates of side effects, with no serious respiratory complications. Two retrospective and 1 prospective observational study reported that amiodarone used either for the treatment of POAF, or for prophylaxis against it, had similar rates of postoperative respiratory complications, length of hospital stay and mortality, compared with either no treatment or treatment with other prophylactic or therapeutic agents. In accordance with the Society of Thoracic Surgeons guidelines on prophylaxis and management of POAF in general thoracic surgery, these data suggest that amiodarone is a safe agent for the management of POAF after lung resection. Careful monitoring in patients treated with amiodarone after pneumonectomy should be considered because development of acute lung toxicity can increase length of hospital stay, morbidity and mortality. Further studies may also be needed to identify the subset of pneumonectomy patients at risk of pulmonary toxicity after use of amiodarone.

Abstract: We experienced two patients with serious arrhythmias associated with the administration of ledipasvir (LDV) and sofosbuvir (SOF). Neither patient took amiodarone, an agent for which concomitant use is prohibited. One patient was 82 years old and hypertensive; the other was 72 years old and had no cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension or diabetes mellitus. The arrhythmias were both serious ventricular tachycardia (VT) that converted spontaneously to sinus rhythm, without treatment, and both patients had good outcomes. These cases suggest that LDV/SOF may be associated with an increased risk of heart-related events.

Abstract: Sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) is a life-threatening condition which requires immediate intervention. We report a case of unusual etiology of sustained VT in a 42-year-old male after a wasp bite in the absence of anaphylaxis. The patient was treated with amiodarone and improved within 48 h. Thus, wasp stings can lead to serious tachyarrhythmias which can be life-threatening. Emergency care physicians should be aware of such arrhythmias in the setting of wasp bites which can be fatal.

Abstract: Cardiotoxicity is a documented complication of Crotalinae envenomation. Reported cardiac complications following snake envenomation have included acute myocardial infarction, electrocardiogram abnormalities and arrhythmias. Few reports exist describing arrhythmia induced by viper envenomation and to our knowledge none describe arrhythmia induced by Crotalinae envenomation. This report concerns the first known case of atrial fibrillation precipitated by rattlesnake bite.
A 73-year-old Caucasian man with a past medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 1 diabetes mellitus, and a baseline first-degree atrioventricular block presented to the emergency department following a rattlesnake bite to his left lower leg. He developed pain and swelling in his left leg two-hour post-envenomation and subsequently received four vials of Crotalidae polyvalent immune fab (ovine). At three-hour post-envenomation following transfer to the intensive care unit, an electrocardiogram revealed new-onset atrial fibrillation. An amiodarone drip was started and the patient successfully converted to normal sinus rhythm approximately six hours after he was found to be in atrial fibrillation. A transthoracic echocardiogram revealed mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy and an ejection fraction of 72%. He was discharged the following day with no hematological abnormalities and a baseline first-degree atrioventricular block.
This is the first documented case of reversible atrial fibrillation precipitated by Crotalinae envenomation. In patients with pertinent risk factors for developing atrial fibrillation, physicians should be aware of the potential for this arrhythmia. Direct toxic effects of venom or structural and electrophysiological cardiovascular abnormalities may predispose snakebite patients to arrhythmia, warranting extended and attentive cardiac monitoring.

Abstract: A 56-year-old man being treated for dilated cardiomyopathy presented with epigastralgia. He was diagnosed with ventricular tachycardia and Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia. After treating incessant ventricular tachycardia, we commenced induction therapy for leukemia with dasatinib and prednisolone to minimize toxicity towards cardiomyocytes and the cardiac conduction system. Although dasatinib was temporarily withheld because of a recurrence of ventricular tachycardia, we rechallenged dasatinib while using bisoprolol and amiodarone and achieved a complete hematological response three weeks later. Although drug interactions between dasatinib and amiodarone were of concern, the blood concentration of each drug remained within the safe range after concomitant use, and there were no adverse cardiac effects such as QT prolongation after rechallenging dasatinib. Induction therapy with dasatinib and prednisolone may be an acceptable therapeutic option for Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia with severe cardiac complications.

Abstract: To describe the treatment of persistent supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) in a young horse in endurance training.
A 6-year-old Arab gelding in endurance training presented for a dysrhythmia and decreased performance. SVT was diagnosed and conversion to a normal sinus rhythm was achieved following administration of a constant rate infusion of amiodarone. However, reversion to SVT occurred shortly after initiation of ridden exercise. A second attempt to convert the dysrhythmia with amiodarone failed, but normal sinus rhythm was achieved with transvenous electrical cardioversion (TVEC). Postmortem examination of the heart revealed extensive fibrous replacement of most of the left atrial myocardium; these changes likely provided the structural substrate for the dysrhythmia. The underlying cause of the fibrosis was not identified.
SVT is a form of supraventricular tachyarrhythmia rarely diagnosed in the horse. A recent report has described sudden death of a horse following attempted conversion of SVT with oral flecainide acetate. In the present report, we describe short-term conversion of SVT in a horse using intravenous amiodarone with no significant adverse effects. When the dysrhythmia recurred, the animal was donated for teaching purposes and conversion was achieved with TVEC. Normal sinus rhythm persisted for 2 weeks until the horse was euthanized for postmortem evaluation of the heart. Intravenous amiodarone or TVEC could be considered as treatments for supraventricular tachyarrhyhmias other than atrial fibrillation in the horse.

Abstract: Amiodarone is an extremely effective antiarrhythmic drug that is known to cause many adverse effects such as pulmonary, thyroid, and liver toxicities. Of these, pulmonary toxicity is most serious. Pulmonary toxicity can present as interstitial pneumonitis, organizing pneumonia, pulmonary nodules and masses, and very rarely pleural effusions. We present a case of a 73-year-old male who presented with progressive exertional dyspnea, nonproductive cough, generalized fatigue, and weakness. He was found to have multiorgan toxicity secondary to long-term treatment with high doses of amiodarone. This case illustrates that amiodarone may cause toxicity involving multiple organs simultaneously in patients receiving long-term therapy and represents the first reported case of amiodarone-induced loculated pleural effusion without associated lung parenchymal involvement.

Abstract: Fluconazole for fungal infections and amiodarone for arrhythmia are commonly prescribed medications, and coadministration of such medications is sometimes inevitable in clinical practice. However, both medications have been associated with prolonged QTc intervals and subsequent arrhythmias, which are sometimes fatal. We present the case of a 75-year-old man with sudden cardiac arrest triggered by coadministration of fluconazole and amiodarone, which raises the need for caution regarding coadministration of these medications. To our knowledge, this case has not been previously described.

Abstract: A variety of systemic drugs including corticosteroids, amiodarone and antipsychotics have been known to cause cataract formation. Typical antipsychotics such as chlorpromazine have been reported to cause cataract formation in varying rates ranging from 22% to 80%. Cataract as an adverse effect resulting from the long term use of atypical antipsychotic has rarely been mentioned in literature, and there is only a single case report of cataract formation from prolonged use of clozapine. We report a rare case of clozpine induced cataract in a young female. The patient was advised to consult her psychiatrist for a change of drug and to undergo cataract surgery.

Abstract: Adenosine is the first-line pharmacotherapy for termination of supraventricular tachycardia through its action on the atrioventricular node. However, pro-arrhythmic effects of adenosine are also recognised, most notably in the presence of pre-excited atrial fibrillation. In this case report, we describe the induction of ventricular fibrillation in a patient with no demonstrable accessory pathway, nor any other structural heart disease. This rare, idiosyncratic reaction has never previously been reported and is of relevance given the widespread and routine use of adenosine in clinical practice.
A 26-year-old woman of Cypriot origin presented to our emergency department with a sudden onset of palpitations and chest discomfort. She was healthy, with no previous medical history and no regular medications. An electrocardiogram demonstrated a narrow complex tachycardia with a rate of 194 beats per minute. Following failure of vagal maneuvers to terminate the tachycardia, the assessing physician administered a single intravenous dose of 6 mg adenosine. Our patient instantaneously developed coarse ventricular fibrillation and circulatory collapse. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was initiated and our patient was rapidly defibrillated to sinus rhythm with a single 150 J direct current shock. A 900-mg loading dose of intravenous amiodarone was commenced and our patient was managed in the cardiac high dependency unit. No further arrhythmias were identified on continuous cardiac monitoring. On review, her presenting electrocardiogram had demonstrated rapidly conducted atrial fibrillation with no evidence of ventricular pre-excitation. Concordantly, her resting electrocardiogram was not suggestive of any accessory pathway. This was conclusively excluded on invasive electrophysiology study, with negative programmed ventricular stimulation up to three extrastimuli. Extensive laboratory investigations were unremarkable and failed to identify an underlying cause for her episode of atrial fibrillation. Furthermore, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a structurally normal heart, with no edema, fibrosis or infarction as well as normal coronary artery anatomy.
Adenosine remains a safe and highly efficacious therapy for supraventricular tachycardia. However, this unusual case demonstrates the ability of adenosine to induce circulatory collapse and reminds the clinician that prompt access to resuscitation, defibrillation, and transcutaneous pacing equipment is mandatory with every administration of this drug.

Abstract: A 66-year-old man was hospitalised due to worsening of his atrial fibrillation, and successfully underwent an electrocardioversion to restore sinus rhythm. He was discharged with a prescription of 600 mg amiodarone daily to retain the sinus rhythm prospectively. 3 weeks after discharge, he noticed that his vision became blurry with cloudy areas spreading throughout his field of view on both eyes simultaneously. The visual symptoms gradually worsened throughout the following 5 months, and the patient was hospitalised in the department of ophthalmology. At this point, his vision had dramatically decreased and visual acuity was measured to 0.05 (1.3 LogMAR) on both eyes. After a thorough medical examination, the patient was diagnosed with an amiodarone-induced toxic optic neuropathy. Regular follow-ups conducted throughout 7 years have shown that the patient's vision has stabilised, but remains limited to the ability of recognising hand motions on both eyes, thus characterising him as blind.

Abstract: A 52-year-old woman, ASA II (American Society of Anesthesia classification II) scheduled for cholecystectomy in an ambulatory center, exhibited a wide-complex tachycardia with ectopy on the monitor after induction with propofol and succinylcholine. Blood pressure remained stable; amiodarone was administered for presumed ventricular tachycardia. A 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) showed a new left bundle branch block (LBBB) at 98 beats per minute (bpm), which resolved when the heart rate slowed. Surgery was postponed, and both the LBBB and ectopy recurred frequently during the next 24 hours in the intensive care unit, particularly at heart rates >90 bpm. Troponins were normal, and the patient was diagnosed with a rate-dependent LBBB and cleared for surgery.

Abstract: A man in his fifties with diabetes had a past history of myocardial infarction and ventricular septal perforation. He underwent hemodialysis about a year ago and was taking amiodarone. He presented with sores and purpura on the lower limbs.-Skin biopsy showed immunofluorescence-negative leukocytoclastic vasculitis. Skin lesions were treated with ointments, which ameliorated the symptoms to some extent, but ulceration relapsed and deteriorated in both number and size. Calciphylaxis was suspected, and a second skin biopsy was performed. No calcium detection,on the arteries was observed, but leukocytoclastic vasculitis was seen. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-related vasculitis, cryoglobulin vasculitis, or anti-phospholipid syndrome were ruled out by negative findings for autoantibodies. Although he was treated with 30 mg prednisolone, his systemic condition deteriorated, and he died of disseminated intravascular coagulation. Autopsy findings showed no vasculitis in the lung, kidney or intestine, and perimyocardial patch infection was observed.Although calciphylaxis was clinically suspected, his condition was diagnosed finally as cutaneous small-vessel vasculitis.

Abstract: To report the only known case, to our knowledge, of amiodarone induced retinal phototoxicity following vitrectomy surgery.
A 66-year-old male presented with visual acuity of 20/150 OS secondary to an epiretinal membrane (ERM). Patient was on oral amiodarone for atrial fibrillation. Baseline spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) revealed an ERM with retinal thickening and schisis. The patient underwent an uncomplicated pars plana vitrectomy and membrane peel using standard vitrectomy settings and illumination. Triamcinolone was used to stain the ERM intraoperatively. ICG was not used. On post-operative day one, vision was count finger (CF) at 1'. At post-operative week one, vision was unchanged and SD-OCT showed macular edema. At post-operative month one, vision remained CF at 1' and macular edema resolved with residual pigmentary changes and subretinal fibrosis resembling phototoxic damage. SD-OCT at one month showed resolution of macular edema, retinal pigment epithelium hyperplasia and an indistinct ellipsoid layer. Fluorescein angiography did not show any neovascularization. At three month follow-up, patient's vision, exam and OCT findings remained unchanged.
Many pharmacologic agents have the ability to alter a patient's sensitivity to solar or artificial radiation. Drugs act as photosensitizers that lead to photochemical damage. Amiodarone has been reported to have such photosensitizing properties in humans. This report describes a case of retinal phototoxicity from intraoperative light exposure photosensitized by systemic amiodarone use.

Abstract: Oral tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are becoming increasingly common in oncology practice due to ease of administration and patient preference. This class of medications is relatively unknown to emergency physicians.
Here we present a case of electrical storm (ES) thought to be associated with ibrutinib, a TKI. The ES was unabated despite antidysrhythmic therapy and electrical cardioversion, and was treated with supportive care, which eventually included the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. This patient had no risk factors or apparent causes of recurrent ventricular tachycardia. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: ES has not previously been described with ibrutinib, but may be associated with off-target effects of the drug.

Abstract: A 78-year-old man was admitted to the authors' hospital with a short history of shortness of breath and pyrexia. He had long-standing moderate mitral regurgitation and stable coronary artery disease. Blood cultures grew Abiotrophia defectiva coccobaccili. Transesophageal echocardiography confirmed the diagnosis of mitral valve endocarditis that necessitated treatment with intravenous benzylpenicillin and gentamicin for six weeks. At nine days after admission the patient developed several episodes of self-limiting monomorphic ventricular tachycardia, without ischemic cardiac pain, associated with hemodynamic compromise requiring treatment with intravenous amiodarone and inotropic support in the Intensive Care Unit. The patient made an uneventful recovery. This case report demonstrates that patients with A. defective endocarditis may be associated with life-threatening ventricular tachycardia, and more so if they have underlying coronary artery disease. Hence, these patients are better managed in the Coronary Care Unit with continuous electrocardiogram monitoring, especially in the early stages of the antibiotic treatment.

Abstract: This article discusses the clinical features, pathophysiology, and management of toxic and endocrine myopathies.
Early detection and expeditious correction of metabolic disturbances in endocrinopathies such as Cushing syndrome, thyroid and parathyroid diseases, and acromegaly can minimize and prevent neurologic complications including myopathy. Recently proposed mechanisms of injury in patients with critical illness myopathy include inhibition of protein synthesis, mitochondrial dysfunction, disruption of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, oxidative stress, and disruption of intramuscular calcium homeostasis, which can cause a myosin-loss myopathy. Mechanisms underlying toxic myopathies include myosin loss; damage to cellular structures, including myofibrils and organelles such as lysosomes and mitochondria; inflammation; and necrosis. Presentations range anywhere from acute, painful, and necrotic myopathies, as can occur in statin myopathy, to more insidious presentations such as steroid myopathy.
Endocrinopathies known to cause myopathy include thyroid and parathyroid diseases, disorders of the adrenal axis such as Cushing syndrome, and acromegaly. Patients in the intensive care unit are at risk for developing critical illness myopathy, also known as myosin-loss myopathy, which should be considered if intensive care unit acquired weakness develops. The most common toxic agents associated with myopathy include statins and other lipid-lowering medications, corticosteroids, colchicine, amiodarone, hydroxychloroquine, and chloroquine.

A 77-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and palpitations, managed with amiodarone, was treated for HER2-positive invasive ductal breast cancer with paclitaxel and trastuzumab as an adjunct to surgery.
There was a strong temporal relationship between the taxane therapy and the development of severe skin and mucosal toxicity due to an unexpected reduction in taxane clearance.
Initially, conversion of paclitaxel to docetaxel, then cessation of docetaxel, symptomatic treatment, rehydration and placement of a nasogastric tube.
Increased exposure to paclitaxel and subsequently docetaxel due to interaction with amiodarone was suspected and confirmed on pharmacokinetic sampling. Analysis of two blood samples taken 9 and 10 days after docetaxel revealed plasma levels of 4.73 and 4.09 ng ml

Abstract: There is a subset of patients who suffer a witnessed ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest and despite receiving reasonable care with medications (epinephrine and amiodarone) and multiple defibrillations (3+ attempts at 200 joules of biphasic current) remain in refractory VF (RVF), also known as electrical storm. The mortality for these patients is as high as 97%. We present the case of a patient who, with a novel approach, survived RVF to outpatient follow up.

Abstract: Amiodarone is often used in the suppression of tachyarrhythmias. One of the more serious adverse effects includes amiodarone pulmonary toxicity (APT). Several pulmonary diseases can manifest including interstitial pneumonitis, organizing pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, pulmonary nodules or masses, and pleural effusion. Incidence of APT varies from 5-15% and is correlated to dosage, age of the patient, and preexisting lung disease.
A 56-year-old male with a past medical history of coronary artery disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was admitted for a coronary artery bypass graft. Post-operatively, the patient was admitted to the ICU for ventilator management and continued to receive his home dose of amiodarone 400 mg orally twice daily, which he had been taking for the past 3 months. The patient was found to be hypoxemic with a PaO2 52 mmHg and bilateral infiltrates on chest x-ray. Patient also complained of new onset dyspnea. Physical exam found bilateral rhonchi with bibasilar crackles and subcutaneous emphysema along the left anterior chest wall. Daily chest x-rays showed worsening of bilateral interstitial infiltrates and pleural effusions. A chest high-resolution computed tomography on post-operative day 3 showed extensive and severe bilateral ground glass opacities. APT was suspected and amiodarone was discontinued. A course of oral prednisone without antibiotics was initiated, and after one week of treatment the chest film cleared, the PaO2 value normalized and dyspnea resolved.
APT occurs via cytotoxic T cells and indirectly by immunological reaction. Typically the lungs manifest a diffuse interstitial pneumonitis with varying degrees of fibrosis. Infiltrates with a 'ground-glass' appearance appreciated on HRCT are more definitive than chest x-ray. Pulmonary nodules can be seen, frequently in the upper lobes. These are postulated to be accumulations of amiodarone in areas of previous inflammation. Those undergoing major cardiothoracic surgery are known to be predisposed to APT. Some elements require consideration: a baseline pulmonary function test (PFT) did not exist prior. APT would manifest a restrictive pattern of PFTs. In APT diffusing capacity (DLCO) is generally >20 percent from baseline. A DLCO was not done in this patient. Therefore, not every type of interstitial lung disease could be ruled out. Key features support a clinical diagnosis: (1) new dyspnea, (2) exclusion of lung infection, (3) exclusion of heart failure, (4) new radiographic features, (5) improvement with withdrawal of amiodarone. Our case illustrates consideration of APT in patients who have extensive use of amiodarone and new onset dyspnea.

Abstract: A 55-year-old male presented with history of nausea, vomiting, palpitation paresthesis and profuse sweating in emergency department 2h after ingestion of "Bachnaag" (Aconite) root. Examination revealed shock with irregular pulses. Initial ECG showed frequent multifocal ventricular ectopics (VE), which later turned to short runs of ventricular tachycardia (VT). Immediate gastric lavage was done and activated charcoal given. Patient was treated with fluid resuscitation without any improvement in blood pressure. Patient was started on nor-adrenaline infusion with gradual recovery from hypotension over a period of 6h, but support was continued for 48h. Amiodarone was started to control ventricular excitability, which persisted over 72h with gradual decrease in frequency of VT and VE. Patient was discharged with normal sinus rhythm on oral amiodarone on 5th day of hospitalization. On follow-up after 2 weeks patient was totally asymptomatic and amiodarone was stopped.

Abstract: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a frequent reason for emergency department visits. According to current guidelines either rate- or rhythm-control are acceptable therapeutic options in such situations. In this report, we present the complicated clinical course of a patient with AF and a rapid ventricular response. Because of paroxysmal AF, the patient was on chronic oral anticoagulation therapy with warfarin. Pharmacological treatment was ineffective to control ventricular rate, and immediate synchronized electrical cardioversion was performed. One hour later, the patient complained of chest pain in combination with marked ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads. Cardiac catheterization with optical coherence tomography disclosed plaque rupture in the left main coronary artery without other significant stenosis. Stent implantation was performed successfully. During the course of the hospital stay, the patient remained asymptomatic and the ST-segment elevations resolved. However, despite treatment with amiodarone it was not possible to keep the patient permanently in sinus rhythm. Therefore, a biventricular pacemaker was implanted and AV node ablation performed.

Abstract: The authors present the case of a 34-year-old male patient seen in our department due to palpitations. On the electrocardiogram monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) was documented, treated successfully with amiodarone. The subsequent study revealed a normal echocardiogram and an apical aneurysm of the left ventricle on magnetic resonance imaging, confirmed by computed tomography coronary angiography that also excluded coronary disease. He underwent an electrophysiological study to determine the origin of the VT and to perform catheter ablation using electroanatomical mapping. VT was induced and radiofrequency applications were performed in the left ventricular aneurysm area. VT was no longer inducible, with acute success. Despite this it was decided to implant a subcutaneous implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). Eight months after the ablation the patient was admitted again due to VT, treated by the ICD.

Abstract: An unusual grayish brown discoloration of the synovium was found during a knee arthroscopy of a 72-year-old man. He also had similar pigmentation affecting the skin on the legs, arms, hands, and face. It was found he had been taking 400 mg of amiodarone hydrochloride daily for last 7 years. Amiodarone is known to cause a slate grey pigmentation of skin and cornea, but we believe this is the first report of amiodarone-induced pigmentation of the synovium. The arthroscopist should be aware of the possibility of drug-related synovial pigmentation and include this in differential diagnosis.

Abstract: Amiodarone is an antiarrhythmic drug that has been commonly used to treat supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias. This drug is an iodine-containing compound that tends to accumulate in several organs, including the lungs. Especially, its main metabolically active metabolite desethylamiodarone can adversely affect many organs. A very well-known severe complication of amiodarone therapy is the amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity. This article presents the case study of an 82-year-old male patient with acute amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity. The patient underwent endovascular aneurysm repair for rapidly increasing abdominal aortic aneurysm. During the postoperative period the patient developed rapid atrial fibrillation and amiodarone therapy was initiated. Subsequently, the patient went into acute respiratory failure and was requiring high supplemental oxygen support and a chest X-ray revealed bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. During the hospital course the patient required mechanical ventilator support. With discontinuation of amiodarone, supportive therapy and steroid treatment patient symptoms significantly improved. Amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity must be considered in the differential diagnosis of all patients on the medication with progressive or acute respiratory symptoms. Early discontinuation of amiodarone and aggressive corticosteroid therapy should be considered as a viable treatment strategy.

Abstract: The patient was a 26 year-old man who was referred to our hospital in June 2011 because of severe heart failure. At age 24 years, he was found to have Becker muscular dystrophy. He received enalapril for cardiac dysfunction; however, he had worsening heart failure and was thus referred to our hospital. Echocardiography showed enlargement of the left ventricle, with a diastolic dimension of 77 mm and ejection fraction of 19%. His condition improved temporarily after an infusion of dobutamine and milrinone. He was then administered amiodarone for ventricular tachycardia; however, he subsequently developed hemoptysis. Amiodarone was discontinued and corticosteroid pulse therapy was administered followed by oral prednisolone (PSL). His creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) level and cardiomegaly improved after the corticosteroid therapy. The PSL dose was reduced gradually, bisoprolol was introduced, and the catecholamine infusion was tapered. A cardiac resynchronization device was implanted; however, the patient's condition gradually worsened, which necessitated dobutamine infusion for heart failure. We readministered 30 mg PSL, which decreased the CPK level and improved the cardiomegaly. The dobutamine infusion was discontinued, and the patient was discharged. He was given 7.5 mg PSL as an outpatient, and he returned to normal life without exacerbation of the heart failure. There are similar reports showing that corticosteroids are effective for skeletal muscle improvement in Duchenne muscular dystrophy; however, their effectiveness for heart failure has been rarely reported. We experienced a case of Becker muscular dystrophy in which corticosteroid therapy was effective for refractory heart failure.

Abstract: Despite its seldom occurrence, fetal tachycardia can lead to poor fetal outcomes including hydrops and fetal death. Management can be challenging and result in maternal adverse effects secondary to high serum drug levels required to achieve effective transplacental antiarrhythmic drug therapy.
A 33-year-old woman at 33 weeks of gestation with a diagnosis of a fetal sustained superior ventricular tachycardia developed chest pain, shortness of breath, and bigeminy on electrocardiogram secondary to digoxin toxicity despite subtherapeutic serum drug levels. She required supportive care with repletion of corresponding electrolyte abnormalities. After resolution of cardiac manifestations of digoxin toxicity, the patient was discharged home. The newborn was discharged at day 9 of life on maintenance amiodarone.
We describe an interesting case of digoxin toxicity with cardiac manifestations of digoxin toxicity despite subtherapeutic serum drug levels. This case report emphasizes the significance of instituting an early diagnosis of digoxin toxicity during pregnancy, based not only on serum drug levels but also on clinical presentation. In cases of refractory supportive care, digoxin Fab fragment antibody administration should be considered. With timely diagnosis and treatment, excellent maternal and perinatal outcomes can be achieved.

Abstract: Dronedarone is a benzofuran derivative resembling amiodarone that was intended to reduce the iodine-associated tissue deposition and organ toxicity seen with the latter. The utility of dronedarone for patients with ventricular arrhythmias has not been thoroughly evaluated. We present our experience with its use to treat refractory ventricular tachycardia storm and review the literature.
An 85 year-old gentleman with multiple medical comorbidities including ischemic and non-ischemic cardiomyopathy with severe biventricular systolic dysfunction presented with ventricular tachycardia storm. Therapeutic options were limited given his frail medical status, failures of sotalol, mexilitine, and catheter ablation therapies along with drug-toxicities from amiodarone. Dronedarone was thus considered as off-label use following informed consent. The patient unfortunately developed fatal multisystem organ failure including acute severe hepatotoxicity from dronedarone.
Novel therapies for drug-refractory ventricular arrhythmias are long overdue given the limitations of available pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic options. Off-label use of antiarrhythmic agents such as dronedarone is considered a treatment of last-resort in patients who otherwise have no therapeutic options. Given the paucity of reported cases regarding dronedarone for the treatment of ventricular tachyarrhythmias, no conclusive recommendations can be made at this time aside from words of caution. Despite the potential ventricular antiarrhythmic effects of dronedarone, careful patient evaluation is required to identify those at greatest risk of drug-related adverse events particularly in those patients with significant comorbidities such as advanced hepatic, renal, and cardiovascular disease.

Abstract: We report a case of nonimmune hydrops fetalis caused by atrial flutter, which was successfully treated by intraperitoneal and intra-amniotic injections of amiodarone.
A 27-year-old woman presented at 30 weeks of pregnancy with hydrops fetalis caused by a fetal atrial flutter. As the transplacental passage of antiarrhythmic agents is impaired in hydrops fetalis, we chose direct treatment using fetal intraperitoneal and intra-amniotic injections (75-300 mg) of amiodarone. We managed to successfully convert the fetal atrial flutter to normal sinus rhythm. The woman delivered a live female baby at 33 weeks of gestation with normal sinus rhythm and neurological development.
Intrauterine antiarrhythmic treatment can reduce perinatal morbidity and mortality. This report suggests that direct fetal therapy using intraperitoneal or intra-amniotic injections of amiodarone constitutes an effective treatment for atrial flutter in cases of hydrops fetalis.

Abstract: Caffeine is arguably the most widely used stimulant drug in the world. Here we describe a suicide attempt involving caffeine overdose whereby the patient's severe intoxication was successfully treated with the prompt infusion of Intralipid. A 19-year-old man was found in an agitated state at home by the volunteer emergency team about 1 h after the intentional ingestion of 40 g of caffeine (tablets). His consciousness decreased rapidly, followed quickly by seizures, and electrocardiographic monitoring showed ventricular fibrillation. Advanced life support maneuvers were started immediately, with the patient defibrillated 10 times and administered 5 mg epinephrine in total and 300 + 150 mg of amiodarone (as well as lidocaine and magnesium sulfate). The cardiac rhythm eventually evolved to asystole, necessitating the intravenous injection of epinephrine to achieve the return of spontaneous circulation. However, critical hemodynamic instability persisted, with the patient's cardiac rhythm alternating between refractory irregular narrow complex tachycardia and wide complex tachycardia associated with hypotension. In an attempt to restore stability we administered three successive doses of Intralipid (120 + 250 + 100 mg), which successfully prevented a severe cardiovascular collapse due to a supra-lethal plasma caffeine level (>120 mg/L after lipid emulsion). The patient survived without any neurologic complications and was transferred to a psychiatric ward a few days later. The case emphasizes the efficacy of intravenous lipid emulsion in the resuscitation of patients from non-local anesthetic systemic toxicity. Intralipid appears to act initially as a vehicle that carries the stimulant drug away from heart and brain to less well-perfused organs (scavenging mechanism) and then, with a sufficient drop in the caffeine concentration, possibly as a tonic to the depressed heart.

Abstract: Even though pulmonary embolism is by far the most common cause of filling defect in the pulmonary arterial system, other less common etiologies should be considered especially in the setting of atypical clinical scenario or unusual imaging findings. Unusual pattern of filling defect in the pulmonary artery in the setting of chronic inflammatory/fibrotic parenchymal lung disease should raise the concern for systemic to pulmonary artery shunt. This diagnosis is typically made by conventional angiography. Dynamic 4D CT angiography however can be a safe, noninvasive and effective alternative tool for making such a diagnosis. It has the added value of multiplanar reconstruction capabilities and providing detailed anatomy which can be vital for interventional radiologists when planning their approach for possible intervention. We present 2 cases of such shunts, and illustrate the demonstration of these shunts by using dynamic 4D CT angiography.

Abstract: Kawasaki disease is an acute, febrile, self-limiting, inflammatory systemic vasculitis seen in early childhood, most commonly in those below 5 years of age. In Kawasaki disease, the coronary arteries are most commonly affected, which may lead to asymptomatic coronary artery ectasia or formation of an aneurysm. Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia(PSVT) is a severe and rare cardiovascular complication of Kawasaki disease. A case of Kawasaki disease presenting with unusual findings, including subdural effusion and PSVT is reported.
This is a 4-month-10-day-old boy presents with anterior fontanelle bulging and moderate bilateral subdural effusion at the acute stage of Kawasaki disease and PSVT at the subacute stage of Kawasaki disease. The subdural effusion was resolution after intravenous immunoglobulin(IVIG) administration. And the PSVT was subsided after administered 3 doses of adenosine, 1 dose of amiodarone loading and Propranolol twice per day use. At 1-year follow-up has made a complete recovery with no arrhythmia episodes, developmental effects or abnormal neurologic findings.
Subdural effusion in the acute stage of Kawasaki disease may be an inflammatory response. It may resolves spontaneously after anti-inflammatory treatment such as IVIG infusion. PSVT is a severe cardiovascular complication of Kawasaki disease. In those who taking aspirin, we need to carefully observe the heart rhythm and PSVT side effects, especially in the first month.

Abstract: There is increasing interest in interventional therapies targeting the cardiac sympathetic nervous system to suppress ventricular arrhythmias. In this case report, we describe an 80-year-old patient with ischemic cardiomyopathy and multiple implantable cardioverter-defibrillator shocks due to refractory ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation who was unable to continue biweekly stellate ganglion block procedures using bupivacaine 0.25% for suppression of his arrhythmias. He had previously failed antiarrhythmic drug therapy with amiodarone, catheter ablation, and attempted surgical autonomic denervation. He underwent pulsed radiofrequency treatment (3 lesions, 2 minutes each, temperature 42°C, 2-Hz frequency, 20-millisecond pulse width) of the left stellate ganglion resulting in persistent arrhythmia suppression for more than 12 months duration. This represents the first report of a pulsed radiofrequency stellate ganglion lesion providing long-term suppression of ventricular arrhythmias. Further study of this technique in patients with refractory ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation is warranted.

Abstract: A 65-year-old man with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, underwent an autopsy 2 months after the successful ablation of a sustained left ventricular (LV) summit ventricular tachycardia (VT). The patient died due to interstitial pneumonia from amiodarone use. The earliest activation sites of the VT were documented from both inside the anterior interventricular vein (AIV) and epicardial surface. The diameter of the AIV was 3-4 mm, and the radiofrequency (RF) lesion inside the AIV was a slight lesion due to high impedance with a high temperature. The lesion from the epicardial surface was also superficial and insufficient due to neighboring coronary arteries and the existence of epicardial fat. A successful application was performed from the LV endocardium, and diffuse myocardial fibrosis was observed in the mid-myocardium including inside the RF lesions. The actual relationship between the myocardial fibrosis and LV summit VT remains unclear, but this case showed the difficulty of achieving a successful ablation from the epicardial side, when the focus exists in the mid-myocardium around the LV summit.

Abstract: Amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) type I describes inducement of clinical hyperthyroidism by excessive thyroidal iodine in the setting of latent Graves disease, and therapy differs from that used for AIT type II. A 65-year-old man previously on amiodarone for atrial fibrillation developed clinical hyperthyroidism. Diagnosis of AIT was made, but the type was not clear. Tc sestamibi thyroid scan showed diffusely increased uptake and retention in an enlarged thyroid gland, a pattern consistent with AIT type I. Methimazole was initiated and controlled the thyrotoxicosis. I iodide thyroid scan and uptake study performed later was consistent with Graves disease.

Abstract: A 49-year-old woman, with no relevant family history, was admitted in 1996 for arrhythmic storm with polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (torsade de pointes) which degenerated into ventricular fibrillation. Iatrogenic causes were excluded, the electrocardiogram (ECG) was normal and there was no structural heart disease. She refused cardioverter-defibrillator implantation. Treatment was begun with amiodarone, which she took irregularly. She remained asymptomatic until 2014 when she was admitted for a new arrhythmic storm with torsade de pointes, refractory to antiarrhythmic therapy and aggravated by ventricular pacing (65 defibrillations). She had frequent ventricular extrasystoles (with short-coupled period <300 ms) preceding the tachycardia. After administration of isoprenaline infusion electric stability was maintained. In this setting and in the absence of structural heart disease or iatrogenic cause, a diagnosis of short-coupled variant torsade de pointes was established. A cardioverter-defibrillator was implanted and she was treated with verapamil, without recurrence of arrhythmias.

Abstract: Sinus node dysfunction is one of the most common arrhythmias in elderly patients; it is usually associated with intermittent and variable symptoms, thus making it difficult to diagnose. We present the case of an elderly female patient with a personal history of atrial fibrillation treated for the last three years with amiodarone; she was admitted to the Geriatric Clinic for non-specific symptoms with onset two months previously for which she had already sought care in different medical services. Clinical examination showed severe bradycardia; ECG and Holter ECG on admission confirmed severe bradycardia, with a heart rate between 29 and 50 beats/min (bpm). Given her long-term treatment with amiodarone we looked for and found hyperthyroidism; the endocrine examination led to the diagnosis of mixed type Amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis and initiation of corticosteroid and antithyroid treatment. The evolution of cardiac arrhythmia was monitored with the help of several Holter ECGs performed after amiodarone washout and return to the euthyroid state, which revealed a tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome initially masked by the side effects of the unsupervised therapy with amiodarone, and properly treated by the implantation of a pacemaker.

Abstract: Although echinocandins are relatively safe antifungal drugs, cardiovascular toxicity is an emerging adverse event. This report reviews those side effects and describes a case of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia suggestive of torsades de pointes with micafungin.
The patient was on micafungin for oesophageal candidiasis due to drug-drug interactions with fluconazole and amiodarone.
This is the first known case of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia with micafungin as the possible cause. Clinicians should be aware of this potential adverse event and monitor patients receiving concomitant drugs that can prolong QT interval.

Abstract: Adverse effects of amiodarone are rarely seen in pediatric patients, but may occur if amiodarone is applied for long-term treatment. Two rather rare phenomena are blue-gray skin pigmentation and pulmonary mass. They represent important differential diagnoses from more common clinical complications like pneumonia and drug-induced toxic skin lesions.

Abstract: We present the case of a 60-year-old man with history of non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy with left ventricular ejection fraction of 40%. His baseline surface 12-lead ECG shows sinus rhythm with PR interval of 170 ms, no evidence of pre-excitation and a normal QT interval. He had a single-chamber automated implantable cardiac defibrillator (AICD) inserted for sustained wide complex tachycardia associated with palpitations. Subsequently, he presented with recurrent shocks from the AICD coming on at rest despite treatment with amiodarone. He did not experience any significant cardiovascular symptoms except for mild palpitations. There were no reversible causes found for his arrhythmia. Figure 1 shows the device EGM of the event leading to the shock.

Abstract: Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) are a viable treatment option for patients with end-stage heart failure. LVADs can improve survival, quality of life, and functional status. The indications for LVAD placement to support left ventricular function are temporary support, a bridge to transplantation, or destination therapy.
A 61-year-old man with past medical history significant for advanced congestive heart failure from ischemic cardiomyopathy, status post LVAD (HeartMate II; Thoratec Corporation, Pleasanton, CA) placement 2009 as destination therapy, presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with implantable cardiac defibrillators firing four times that morning. While in the care of Emergency Medical Services, he was in ventricular tachycardia, and they gave him a bolus of amiodarone 150 mg intravenously prior to arrival in the ED. He was reportedly alert and oriented without any chest pain on arrival to the ED, where an electrocardiogram was obtained showing polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: Emergency physicians must be familiar with the atypical presentations of potentially lethal dysrhythmias in this patient population. They must also be familiar with the major adverse events after LVAD implantation. These include device malfunction, cardiac dysrhythmias, bleeding, thromboembolism, neurological events, and infection. The causes of device malfunction can include thrombus formation with hemolysis, mechanical failure of the impeller, and driveline lead fractures with electric failure. Although time is critical in the heart failure patient with an LVAD failure or complication, expert consultation with cardiology or the LVAD specialist should occur when possible.

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of death in captive chimpanzees and is often associated with myocardial fibrosis, which increases the risk of cardiac arrhythmias. In this case report, we present a 36-y-old male chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) diagnosed with frequent ventricular premature complexes (VPC). We placed a subcutaneous implantable loop recorder for continual ECG monitoring to assess his arrhythmias without the confounding effects of anesthetics. During his initial treatment with the antiarrhythmia medication amiodarone, he developed thrombocytopenia, and the drug was discontinued. After reviewing other potential therapies for the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias, we elected to try acupuncture and laser therapy in view of the positive results and the lack of adverse side effects reported in humans. We used 2 well-known cardiac acupuncture sites on the wrist, PC6 (pericardium 6) and HT7 (heart 7), and evaluated the results of the therapy by using the ECG recordings from the implantable loop recorder. Although periodic increases in the animal's excitement level introduced confounding variables that caused some variation in the data, acupuncture and laser therapy appeared to decrease the mean number of VPC/min in this chimpanzee.

Abstract: We herein describe a fetal case of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) with double mutations in transmembrane protein 43 (TMEM43). RV aneurysm and ventricular arrhythmia were detected during the fetal period. After birth, electrocardiogram showed frequent premature ventricular contractions (PVC) of left bundle branch block morphology and epsilon waves in the right-sided chest leads. Echocardiography also indicated RV aneurysm with regionally decreased systolic function. PVC disappeared after treatment with amiodarone and mexiletin. Mutations in TMEM43, which was recently identified as the causative gene of ARVC type 5, were also confirmed in the present patient and in the patient's mother, and they were therefore diagnosed with ARVC. The present case confirms that symptoms of ARVC can emerge during the fetal period. Pediatricians need to keep in mind the possibility of ARVC when they encounter patients with RV aneurysm and arrhythmia.

Abstract: We present a case of accidental injection of tranexamic acid during spinal anesthesia for an elective cesarean delivery. Immediately following intrathecal injection of 2mL of solution, the patient complained of severe back pain, followed by muscle spasm and tetany. As there was no evidence of spinal block, the medications given were checked and a 'used' ampoule of tranexamic acid was found on the spinal tray. General anesthesia was induced but muscle spasm and tetany persisted despite administration of a non-depolarizing muscle relaxant. Hemodynamic instability, ventricular tachycardia, and status epilepticus developed, which were refractory to phenytoin, diazepam, and infusions of thiopental, midazolam and amiodarone. Magnesium sulfate was administered postoperatively in the intensive care unit, following which the frequency of seizures decreased, eventually stopping. Unfortunately, on postoperative day three the patient died from cardiopulmonary arrest after an oxygen supply failure that was not associated with the initial event. This report underlines the importance of double-checking medications before injection in order to avoid a drug error. As well, it suggests that magnesium sulfate may be useful in stopping seizures caused by the intrathecal injection of tranexamic acid.

Abstract: A 32-year-old, fit and healthy, Caucasian male presented with a less than 24-hour history of palpitations with the onset following participation in helicopter underwater escape training (HUET). He reported no chest pain, shortness of breath, syncope, or pre-syncope symptoms. On examination, an irregularly irregular pulse was noted at a rate of 120 beats per minute with a blood pressure of 132/84. There was no evidence of congestive cardiac failure. The electrocardiogram (ECG) demonstrated atrial fibrillation at 97 beats per minute with a normal axis, normal QRS complexes, and a QTc of 399 ms. Bloods were all within normal limits and a chest x-ray showed no abnormality. The patient was loaded with amiodarone and reverted to sinus rhythm with a normal post-reversion ECG. Five years on, following further HUET, the patient presented with an identical presentation. His ECG showed fast atrial fibrillation at a rate of 115 beats per minute. On this occasion, he was sedated and Direct Current cardioverted with reversal to sinus rhythm after one shock. It was felt that the precipitating factor for this patient's atrial fibrillation, in both cases, was HUET. The case discussed describes a previously fit and well subject who developed a sustained arrhythmia secondary to cold water submersion. Evidence suggests water submersion can provoke cardiac arrhythmias via the suggested theory of "autonomic conflict." It has been proposed that a number of unexplained deaths related to water submersion may be secondary to arrhythmogenic syncope.

Abstract: Thyroid carcinoma (TC) is the most common endocrine malignancy. Although the overall prognosis for patients with TC is good, up to 20-30% of patients have recurrent or persistent disease after conventional therapy by surgical resection and radioactive iodine (RAI). Amiodarone is a highly efficient anti-arrhythmic drug with a very long half-life, so it may interfere with RAI many months after the drug withdrawal. This case report mirrors the challenges of thyroid cancer management in an amiodarone-treated patient.

Abstract: A 44-year-old woman with no medical history presented to the emergency department with a 2 h history of sudden onset chest pressure, palpitations, diaphoresis and shortness of breath. She reported a 90-pound unintentional weight loss, increased appetite, irritability, night sweats and palpitations for 2 months. Physical examination revealed a heart rate (HR) of 269 bpm and a blood pressure of 116/94 mm Hg. Her ECG revealed a wide-complex tachycardia with right bundle branch morphology and an HR of 265 bpm. Intravenous adenosine was administered with resolution of the arrhythmia and symptoms. Her subsequent ECG revealed sinus tachycardia with δ waves, which was consistent with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome. Laboratory findings confirmed thyroid storm and treatment began with intravenous hydrocortisone, methimazole, metoprolol, amiodarone and iodine drops. Graves' disease was confirmed based on the presence of serum thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor antibody. The patient underwent successful WPW accessory tract ablation 6 weeks after initial presentation.

Abstract: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia and it is an independent risk for serious events. Acupuncture has been growing in popularity in the West, and there are reports of its benefits in treating AF. We report a 57-year-old man who was admitted after having an allergic reaction to amiodarone administered to treat paroxysmal AF with fast ventricular response. Cardioversion with intravenous propafenone was uneventful. Before an attempt of electric cardioversion, he was treated with acupuncture as additional therapy to peroral propafenone. After acupuncture treatment consisting of 10 treatments during 30 days period, both immediate cardioversion to sinus rhythm and no paroxysmal AF during 30 days period were recorded.

Abstract: To report a case of intra-arterial amiodarone injection in a hemodynamically unstable patient leading to acute vessel occlusion and a subsequent compartment syndrome.
Case report.
Prehospital setting, emergency department and ICU of a university hospital.
A 58-year-old woman presenting with a ventricular tachycardia of 190 beats/min was administered amiodarone through an accidently placed arterial access in the left cubital fossa. Quickly, the woman developed clinical signs of an acute arterial occlusion.
Immediate left brachial artery angiography with subsequent thrombectomy was performed.
A thrombotic occlusion at the injection side was found, which was immediately recanalized by thrombus aspiration. In addition to anticoagulation and an adenosine diphosphate-antagonist an adjunct therapy with vasodilators and gpIIb/IIIa inhibitors was given and repetitive duplex sonography confirmed arterial flow. However, despite restoration of blood flow the patient developed a severe compartment syndrome of the arm and had to receive multistep surgical interventions.
This is the first report of an acute thrombotic vessel occlusion leading to a compartment syndrome upon accidental intra-arterial injection of amiodarone in an emergency setting. In the hemodynamically unstable patient healthcare providers should be aware of arterial miscanulation and its consequences. Upon intra-arterial injection, a direct antithrombotic and vasodilative therapy should be administered via the initially misplaced arterial access, which may include a gpIIb/IIIa inhibitor.

Abstract: Iodine-induced thyrotoxicosis, which raises several diagnostic and therapeutical challenges, is often overlooked. Hyperthyroidism can induce atrial fibrillation, a harmful arrhythmia which can precipitate heart failure and cause stroke. We report the case of an elderly man who was diagnosed with tachyfibrillation secondary to hyperthyroidism. Thyroid hyperfunction was subsequently related both to previous amiodarone therapy (probably mixed form) and the recent use of iodinated contrast medium for computed tomography scan. Thyroid ultrasonography showed a plongeant multinodular goitre. After initial worsening, thyroid function improved slowly but progressively on high-dose thyreostatic therapy combined with steroid therapy; tachyfibrillation caused heart failure and a thrombus in the left atrium, and proved initially resistant to combined antiarrhythmic treatments. Progressive reduction in thyroid hormone levels, together with combined cardiologic therapies, controlled the heart rate, though atrial fibrillation persisted; anticoagulant therapy resolved the atrial thrombus. Alterations in thyroid function are common in amiodarone-treated patients, who therefore require regular hormonal checks. The different forms of amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis must be investigated, since they require different therapies, though mixed forms often occur. The superimposition of further iodine excess due to other causes may be catastrophic and cause severe cardiac problems in these patients.

Abstract: Organising pneumonia is one of the responses of the lung to injury and can mimic bacterial pneumonia but importantly it does not respond to antibiotic therapy. We present the case of a 67-year-old male who was diagnosed with organising pneumonia secondary to dronedarone. Drug reactions are a common cause and early identification of the culprit is mandatory to prevent further morbidity and ensure a favourable outcome. On chest radiography there may be fleeting peripheral consolidation, while computed tomography can show a range of stereotyped patterns including perilobular consolidation. Bronchoscopic biopsy may not always be possible but response to steroids is often rapid following removal of the culprit drug. Dronedarone should be included in the list of possible drugs and the Pneumotox database remains a useful resource for the clinician when acute drug-related pneumotoxicity is suspected.

Abstract: We firstly report a postoperative hemodialysis patient who was co-administered with amiodarone and dexmedetomidine and developed severe bradycardia followed by cardiac arrest. A 79-year-old male patient underwent an amputation of the right lower extremity. The electrocardiogram of the patient showed a complete right bundle branch block with left anterior fascicular block before the anesthesia, and paroxysmal atrial tachycardia over 200 beats/min lasting 15 min was observed during surgery. After admission to the intensive care unit, the intensivist and the consultant cardiologist decided to treat tachycardia using amiodarone. The initial dosing of amiodarone and the maintenance infusion succeeded to decrease the heart rate. Approximately 2 h and a half after the start of dexmedetomidine infusion for sedation, the heart rate gradually declined and severe bradycardia suddenly followed by cardiac arrest was observed. Resuscitation was promptly initiated and the patient regained sinus rhythm without delay. In retrospective analysis, the monitoring record of the electrocardiogram revealed the marked atrioventricular conduction abnormalities. This is the first case report concerning a cardiac arrest induced by amiodarone and dexmedetomidine.

Abstract: Acute hepatitis is a very rare, but potentially fatal, adverse effect of intravenous amiodarone. We present a case of an 88-year-old man with history of ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy and severely depressed left ventricular function that was admitted to our coronary care unit with diagnosis of decompensated heart failure and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. A few hours after the beginning of intravenous amiodarone he developed an acute hepatitis. There was a completely recovery within the next days after amiodarone withdrawn and other causes of acute hepatitis have been ruled out. This case highlights the need for close monitoring of hepatic function during amiodarone infusion in order to identify any potential hepatotoxicity and prevent a fatal outcome. Oral amiodarone is, apparently, a safe option in these patients.

Abstract: Ventricular tachycardia (VT) is life-threatening subgroup of wide QRS complex tachycardia (WCT). VT is usually associated with structural heart diseases, but it can occur in the absence of any cardiovascular diseases. Adverse cardiac effect of sodium bicarbonate in healthy subjects is not well described. A 30-year-old healthy man with excessive intake of sodium bicarbonate-related VT is presented. He was using sodium bicarbonate during last 2 months to lose weight. He has no risk factors and any cardiovascular or systemic diseases. After intravenous administration of amiodarone, tachycardia ended and his rhythm converted to sinus rhythm with normal electrocardiogram. Patient is asymptomatic, and no VT was observed without any medications at 1 year of follow-up.

Abstract: Left ventricular posterior fascicular tachycardia (LVPFT) is an idiopathic form of VT characterized by right bundle branch block morphology and left axis deviation. The mechanism of LPFVT is thought to be localized reentry close to the posterior fascicle. We present the case of a 24-year-old medical student who was admitted to the emergency department complaining of palpitations. The ECG showed an aspect suggestive of LVPFT. Vagal maneuvers, adenosine and i.v. Metoprolol were ineffective in terminating the arrhythmia. Conversion to sinus rhythm was obtained 10 h later, with i.v Amiodarone. The ECG in sinus rhythm showed left posterior fascicular block. Because antiarrhythmic drugs were not desired by the patient, VT ablation was proposed. The electrophysiological study identified the mechanism of arrhythmia to be reentry using the slowly conducting verapamil-sensitive fibers as the antegrade limb and the posterior fascicle as the retrograde limb. Radiofrequency applications near the posterior fascicle, in the lower half of the interventricular septum, at the junction of the two proximal thirds with the distal third interrupted the tachycardia and made it non-inducible at programmed stimulation. The case is unusual as the patient had a left posterior fascicular block during sinus rhythm before ablation. This demonstrates that the reentry circuit of VT does not need antegrade conduction through the posterior fascicle for perpetuation.

Abstract: Amiodarone is frequently used in emergency departments for treatment of arrhythmias. Incidence of several amiodarone-related adverse events is unknown. The literature is sparse for potentially life-threatening adverse effects of amiodarone.
We present a case of a male patient who presented with chest discomfort and rapid atrial fibrillation. He was known to have paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, which did not respond to initial beta-blocker treatment. The second-line drug amiodarone was given to the patient for rate control. He developed severe hypotension related to amiodarone and required inotropic support along with rapid-sequence intubation.
Intravenous amiodarone can cause severe and refractory hypotension.

Abstract: Electrical storm (ES) was observed in an 82-year-old man with recent myocardial infarction. Conventional therapy, including amiodarone, could not suppress the ES. After more than 100 electrical defibrillations, we were finally able to control the ES with the administration of landiolol. It is known that landiolol can inhibit ES. However, we hesitate to use landiolol in patients with low cardiac output. We would like to emphasize that careful use of landiolol should be considered in patients with refractory ES after myocardial infarction, although cardiac output is severely reduced.

Abstract: We describe the case of a 73-year-old woman with liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who developed 2 distinct episodes of paroxystic atrial fibrillation (AF) each of which occurred 1 to 4 hours after iodine medium contrast-enhanced computed tomography. Sinus rhythm was restored by amiodarone therapy after the first AF episode and by electrical cardioversion after the second one. A careful clinical, biochemical, and instrumental examination showed that the patient had subclinical hyperthyroidism and moderate mitral insufficiency with mild atrial enlargement.Thus, the coexistence of both subclinical disthyroidism and of cardiac anatomical alterations may have predisposed the patient to AF that in fact occurred when exogenous iodine administration triggered a hyperthyroidism status.

Abstract: Here we describe a wide complex tachycardia after bupropion overdose that was responsive to sodium bicarbonate. This rhythm was likely secondary to bupropion-induced sodium channel blockade and corrected QT interval (QTc) prolongation. It is critical for the emergency medicine physician to recognize that a wide complex rhythm in a patient with bupropion overdose may be secondary to sodium channel toxicity and prolonged QTc as this rhythm may be responsive to sodium bicarbonate. Identifying this rhythm as purely ventricular tachycardia can lead to the administration of medications such as amiodarone that may further prolong QTc and contribute to sodium channel blockade, exacerbating bupropion-induced cardiotoxicity.

Abstract: Pneumocystis jirovecii is responsible for P. jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) in immunocompromised individuals, with a recent rise of cases noted in non-HIV patients. A middle-aged man presented with new-onset cough, fever, hypoxia and tachypnoea. He was on a tapering course of dexamethasone for amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis. He developed worsening airspace disease necessitating mechanical ventilation. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid was positive for P. jirovecii and he was managed with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and pentamidine, but succumbed to cardiorespiratory arrest. One-third of PJP cases occur in non-HIV patients, and have a higher morbidity and mortality. Most immunocompromised patients typically exhibit PJP during a corticosteroid taper. The accurate dose, duration or frequency of steroid use in not well established. Diagnosis of PJP in this population is more challenging due to lower BAL yield with alternate modalities such as serum/BAL β-d-glucan and PCR enhancing the yield. Further studies are needed to highlight PJP prophylaxis in patients with steroid use.

Abstract: Rivaroxaban is a factor-Xa-inhibitor which has been shown to be non-inferior to the vitamin-K-antagonist (VKA) warfarin in atrial fibrillation patients. In the manufacturer-sponsored trial, the rate of intracranial hemorrhage in rivaroxaban-treated patients was lower than in VKA-treated. It is unknown if this advantage of rivaroxaban is also present outside clinical trials. We report a patient with fatal cerebral bleeding 4months after initiation of rivaroxaban. Bleeding might be favored by hypertension, hypoalbuminemia, renal impairment, hepatopathy and drug-drug interactions of rivaroxaban with amiodarone and bisoprolol. Patients have to be monitored closely after initiation of rivaroxaban, especially if they are treated with possibly interacting drugs. Additionally, hepatic function, albumin level, and renal function have to be closely monitored. Therapy with VKA seems more convenient, safer and more favorable for the patient than rivaroxaban with its associated uncertainties concerning metabolization and drug-drug interactions and no possibility to reverse its activity in emergency situations.

Abstract: Nearly pure caffeine is sold as a "dietary supplement," with instructions to ingest 1/64th to 1/16th of one teaspoon (50-200 mg). We report a patient with refractory cardiac dysrhythmias treated with defibrillation, beta-adrenergic blockade, and hemodialysis to highlight concentrated caffeine's dangers.
A 20-year-old woman presented with severe agitation, tremor, and vomiting approximately 1-2 h after suicidal ingestion of concentrated caffeine (powder and tablets). Within minutes, ventricular fibrillation commenced. Defibrillation, intubation, and amiodarone administration achieved return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). Shortly thereafter, she developed pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VTach), with ROSC after defibrillation and lidocaine. She subsequently experienced 23 episodes of pulseless VTach, each responsive to defibrillation. Activated charcoal was administered via orogastric tube. An esmolol infusion was started. Hemodialysis was initiated once she was hemodynamically stable. She was extubated the following day, continued on oral metoprolol, and transferred to psychiatry on hospital day seven, achieving full neurological recovery. Serum caffeine concentrations performed approximately six and 18 h post-ingestion (pre/post-dialysis) were 240.8 mcg/mL and 150.7 mcg/mL.
Severe caffeine toxicity can produce difficult to treat, life-threatening dysrhythmias. Concentrated caffeine, marketed for dietary supplementation, presents a substantial public health risk that demands action to limit consumer availability.

Abstract: Sofosbuvir and daclatasvir are direct-acting antiviral drugs used to treat chronic hepatitis C virus infection. In 2015, the Food and Drug Administration and European Medical Agency warned that bradycardia could occur when amiodarone was administered in combination with sofosbuvir, but no case reports had been published. We report extreme bradycardia within 2 hrs after intake of sofosbuvir and daclatasvir by 2 patients receiving amiodarone. The first patient had a cardiac asystole 30 min after receiving sofosbuvir and daclatasvir. Amiodarone, sofosbuvir, and daclatasvir treatment were stopped; after 10 days, the cardiac evaluation was normal and patient was discharged. The second patient was taking amiodarone and propranolol; 2 hrs after receiving sofosbuvir and daclatasvir, he had an extreme sinus node dysfunction (heart rate of 27beats/min). Amiodarone and propranolol were stopped, but the patient continued receiving sofosbuvir and daclatasvir for 3 days and sinus bradycardia was recorded each day, 2 hrs after intake of these drugs. When he stopped taking the drugs, no bradycardia was observed. Administration of sofosbuvir and daclatasvir on day 13 induced bradycardia 2 hrs after intake. However, no bradycardia occurred following a rechallenge 8 weeks after the patient stopped taking amiodarone. These observations indicate that patients treated with amiodarone should be continuously monitored within the first 48 hrs following the initiation of sofosbuvir and daclatasvir.

Abstract: We present a case report of an 80-year-old woman with volume overload thought initially to be secondary to heart failure, but determined to be amiodarone-induced acute and chronic liver injury leading to submassive necrosis and bridging fibrosis consistent with early cirrhosis. Her histopathology was uniquely absent of steatosis and phospholipidosis, which are commonly seen in AIC.

Abstract: Hepatotoxic complications of long-term oral amiodarone therapy have been well described ; however, liver injury secondary to parenteral infusion of amiodarone is uncommon, potentially fatal, and poorly understood. The hepatotoxicity is thought to result from the diluent polysorbate 80 and not the amiodarone its self. Theories suggest an allergic or immunologic response leading to alterations in the hepatocellular membrane while some propose that ischemia, not a drug reaction, is truly to blame.
Both the PubMed and Embase databases were searched for cases of acute hepatitis implicating intravenous amiodarone with a total of 25 cases from 1986 to 2012 identified. Each case was then carefully evaluated to determine the connection between parenteral amiodarone and acute hepatotoxicity while assessing for evidence of potential ischemia.
Of the 25 published cases of amiodarone induced acute hepatotoxicity available for review, only 10 provide evidence to conclusively implicate parenteral amiodarone as the etiology. We add the eleventh reported case of parenteral amiodarone induced acute severe hepatitis to the literature and report the most comprehensive review of this topic to date.
There is sufficient evidence to support amiodarone induced acute hepatotoxicity as a unique entity separate from ischemic hepatitis. If suspected, parenteral amiodarone should be discontinued and held indefinitely.

Abstract: We present the case of a 68-year-old man admitted to hospital with severe acute kidney injury secondary to statin-induced rhabdomyolysis. Five weeks previously, the patient started a course of clarithromycin for infection of a finger wound with Mycobacterium marinum. His current medications included simvastatin, which he continued along with clarithromycin. The severity of the acute kidney injury necessitated initial continuous venovenous haemofiltration followed by 12 haemodialysis sessions before a spontaneous improvement in renal function occurred. Statins are widely prescribed and we report this case to encourage increased vigilance in avoiding drug interactions known to increase the risk of statin-induced myopathy, including macrolide antibiotics, calcium channel antagonists and amiodarone. The authors would also like to highlight recent guidance on atorvastatin as the statin of choice in patients with chronic kidney disease, and of the need for dose adjustment in those with an estimated glomerular filtration rate less than 30 mLs/min/1.73 m².

Abstract: Amiodarone is an antiarrhythmic medication that can adversely effect various organs including lungs, thyroid gland, liver, eyes, skin, and nerves. The risk of adverse effects increases with high doses and prolonged use. We report a 54-year-old female who presented with multiorgan toxicity after 8 months of low dose (200 mg/day) amiodarone treatment. The findings of confocal microscopy due to amiodarone-induced keratopathy are described. Amiodarone may cause multiorgan toxicity even at lower doses and for shorter treatment periods.

Abstract: Amiodarone represents an effective antiarrhythmic drug for cardioversion of recent-onset atrial fibrillation (AF) and maintenance of sinus rhythm. Acute low back and/or epigastric pain has been reported in the medical literature as a rare side effect of amiodarone, but most cases were Europeans, one was Chinese. We present the case of a Japanese patient who experienced acute severe back pain radiating to the whole body a few minutes after intravenous (IV) infusion of amiodarone.

Abstract: Amiodarone is a widely used antiarrhythmic that is used in the management of a variety of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. Amiodarone-induced lung injury is an adverse effect in 5% of patients taking amiodarone, usually within 12 months of commencing therapy. Different mechanisms of injury and histopathological changes have been proposed and described. Eosinophilic pneumonia is one uncommon presentation of amiodarone-induced lung injury. The following is a case report of a 62-year-old woman who, after taking 400 mg of amiodarone twice daily for 8 months, developed bilateral interstitial pneumonitis with peripheral eosinophilia. After cessation of amiodarone, she had significant improvement in terms of her clinical symptoms and partial regression of pulmonary infiltrates on radiological imaging. The case underlies the importance of vigilance monitoring patients who are taking potentially pneumotoxic drugs as well as describing a classic example of drug-induced pneumonitis.

Abstract: Anaphylactic shock is a life-threatening condition which needs detailed and mediculous clinical assessment and thoughtful treatment. Several causes can join forces in order to degranulate mast cells. Amiodarone which is an iodine-containing highly lipophilic benzofuran can induce allergic reactions and anaphylactic shock in sensitized patients. Epinephrine is a life saving drug, but in sulfite allergic patients it should be given with caution due its metabisulfite preservative. Metals covering cardiac defibrillators and pacemakers can act as antigens attached to serum proteins and induce allergic reactions. In anaphylactic shock, myocardial involvement due to vasospasm-induced coronary blood flow reduction manifesting as Kounis syndrome should be always considered. Clinically, combined treatment targeting the primary cause of anaphylaxis together with protection of cardiac tissue seems to be of paramount importance.

Abstract: Dronedarone is an amiodarone-like antiarrhythmic with a modified structure. The addition of a methyl sulfonyl group theoretically reduces the toxicity of amiodarone, specifically, adverse thyroid and pulmonary effects. Although animal studies have implicated dronedarone as a cause of lung injury, to date controlled trials in humans have not demonstrated an association. A 68-year-old woman developed a dry cough and worsening respiratory distress after receiving dronedarone for 6 months. Discontinuation of dronedarone therapy and subsequent steroid therapy led to a dramatic improvement of symptoms. Dronedarone may be associated with interstitial lung disease. We believe that patients receiving dronedarone should have their diffusing capacity of lung for carbon monoxide and lung volumes monitored prior to initiation of therapy and frequently thereafter.

Abstract: A 66-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease was evaluated due to ventricular tachycardic (VT) storm. The patient continued to have frequent recurrences of VT despite treatment with amiodarone and lidocaine. Since the ventricular arrhythmia could be related to myocardial ischemia related to a chronic total occlusion (CTO) of the right coronary artery, the patient underwent successful percutaneous coronary intervention of the CTO, followed by implantable cardioverter defibrillator implantation. He had no further episodes of VT during his hospital stay. After 9 months of follow-up, he had no further chest pain or clinically apparent recurrent ischemia. Interrogation of his defibrillator has shown brief nonsustained episodes of ventricular tachycardia, but the patient has not required delivery of a shock. The temporal association between treatment of the CTO and resolution of the VT, as well as the lack of recurrence of sustained VT, suggest a causative link between underlying ischemia produced by a chronically occluded coronary artery and provocation of VT and lend supportive evidence to this treatment approach.

Abstract: Dronedarone is a promising, relatively new antiarrhythmic agent characterized by structural similarities to amiodarone but without amiodarone's severe organ toxicity. The proarrhythmic potential of dronedarone, however, is of increasing concern. We describe a 76-year-old woman who had been receiving dronedarone 400 mg twice/day to prevent recurrent atrial tachycardia with rapid ventricular response. Several months later, she came to the emergency department with decompensated congestive heart failure and episodes of atrial tachycardia; digoxin 0.5 mg and furosemide 40 mg were administered intravenously. Thereafter nonsustained torsade de pointes (TdP) tachycardia occurred. She was transferred to the intensive care unit where a dose of amiodarone 150 mg was administered intravenously by mistake. Thereafter, the patient showed sustained TdP necessitating cardiac resuscitation. Dronedarone was discontinued, and digoxin and amiodarone were not administered again. Under dronedarone a relevant QT prolongation was documented that was additionally augmented after concomitant treatment with digoxin and amiodarone. Use of the Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale indicated a probable adverse drug reaction to dronedarone (score of 7). To our knowledge, this is the first case report of a patient who experienced TdP tachycardias while receiving dronedarone therapy in connection with a worsening of heart failure and possible drug interactions with digoxin and amiodarone. Clinicians should be aware of this potential adverse drug reaction and perform repeated heart rate-corrected QT (QTc) interval measurements as well as screening for congestive heart failure in patients receiving dronedarone therapy.

Abstract: Congenital junctional ectopic tachycardia is a rare tachyarrhythmia with high mortality. A pharmacological approach in early infancy is regarded as the first-line therapeutic option. Pharmacologically, amiodarone alone or in combination with other drugs is the most commonly reported effective agent for congenital junctional ectopic tachycardia, but it has many adverse effects. Here we report the case of a 40-day-old infant. The clinical course suggests that combined oral flecainide and propranolol is an effective alternative therapy for early infants. Esophageal lead electrocardiography may give a clear diagnosis of junctional ectopic tachycardia.

Abstract: The remarkable advances made in recent decades in the treatment of haemophilia have resulted in a longer life expectancy for haemophilia patients. The care of diseases related to ageing in these patients is becoming of great interest.

Abstract: A 33-year-old African-American woman was bridged to heart transplantation with a left ventricular assist device. She had a 14-month history of heart failure secondary to viral cardiomyopathy. The patient's refractory ventricular tachycardia was treated with intravenous procainamide owing to the patient's history of amiodarone-induced thyroiditis. After orthotopic cardiac transplant, she experienced prolonged respiratory failure. Serial computed tomography evaluation of the lung revealed diffuse bilateral ground-glass opacities and septal thickening. Bronchoscopies with tissue biopsies were performed with no conclusive results. Specimen samples displayed septal fibrosis with loose fibromyxoid tissue and some hobnail nodularities with no indication of granulomas, neutrophilic infiltration, malignancy, or fungal, viral, or bacterial growth. Histopathological evaluation of the lung wedge biopsy supported a diagnosis of pulmonary fibrosis and noted interstitial fibrosis with areas of focal alveolar hemorrhage and increased macrophage infiltration. Antinuclear body was found to be negative. After in-depth evaluation of the patient's medication history, procainamide was identified as the cause of the toxicity. As procainamide-induced lung fibrosis is relatively uncommon, we present this case to highlight procainamide's potential harm and the need for careful monitoring in postsurgical patients.

Abstract: A 69-year-old Caucasian male with a 25-year history of paranoid schizophrenia was brought to the emergency department because of violence toward the staff in his nursing facility. He was diagnosed with a urinary tract infection and was admitted to the behavioral health unit for medication stabilization. History included a five-year state psychiatric hospital admission and nursing facility placement. Because of poor cognitive function, the patient was unable to corroborate medication history, so the pharmacy student on rotation performed an in-depth chart review. The review revealed a transcription error in 2003 deleting amantadine 100 mg twice daily and adding amiodarone 100 mg twice daily. Subsequent hospitalization resulted in another transcription error increasing the amiodarone to 200 mg twice daily. All electrocardiograms conducted were negative for atrial fibrillation. Once detected, the consulted cardiologist discontinued the amiodarone, and the primary care provider was notified via letter and discharge papers. An admission four months later revealed that the nursing facility restarted the amiodarone. Amiodarone was discontinued and the facility was again notified. This case reviews how a 10-year-old medication error went undetected in the electronic medical records through numerous medication reconciliations, but was uncovered when a single comprehensive medication review was conducted.

Abstract: We report a case of intravenous (IV) amiodarone drug induced liver injury (DILI). The patient received IV N-acetylcysteine (NAC) which resulted in a rapid improvement in liver enzymes. While the specific mechanisms for the pathogenesis of IV amiodarone DILI and the therapeutic action of IV NAC are both unknown, this case strongly implies at least some commonality. Because IV amiodarone is indicated for the treatment of serious cardiac arrhythmias in an intensive care unit setting, some degree of ischemic hepatitis is likely a cofactor in most cases.

Abstract: We describe a 7-week-old female infant who presented with refractory supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). During amiodarone infusion, she developed hypotension and cardiac arrest requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support. After successful control of SVT using procainamide infusion, she was weaned from ECMO and discharged home on oral flecainide. We conclude that infants with acidosis, ventricular dysfunction, and prolonged refractory SVT may poorly tolerate intravenous amiodarone.

Abstract: Guarana (Paullinia cupana) is the climbing vine native to Amazon Basin, characterized by high caffeine content in its seeds. Guarana extract is a common ingredient of energy drinks used in order to boost energy and physical endurance and increase alertness. Severe caffeine intoxication is rare, but may be life-threatening mostly due to supraventricular and ventricular dysrhythmias.
We present the case of intentional caffeine poisoning after ingestion of tablets containing guarana extract, complicated by atrial fibrillation.
A44-year-old man with no significant medical history was admitted to hospital about 21 h after ingestion of guarana extract containing 1.6 g of caffeine. Typical symptoms of caffeine toxicity, i.e. nausea, vomiting, anxiety and palpitaions, occurred shortly after ingestion. On admission, he was conscious, with blood pressure of 136/86 mmHg, heart rate of 106-113 beats per minute, fever of 37.8 °C, and symmetrically increased deep tendon reflexes. QTc interval in electrocardiogram was prolonged to 0.542 s. Laboratory tests revealed hypokalemia, hyperglycemia, leukocytosis, as well as elevated creatinine and creatine phosphokinase levels. Approximately 45 h post ingestion, the patient developed atrial fibrillation with fast ventricular rhythm. Tachydysrythmia subsided after infusion of amiodarone and restoration of electrolyte balance. Echocardiogram revealed presence of asymmetrical hypertrophy of the left ventricle with the systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve and normal left ventricular outflow tract gradient suggesting non-obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
Acute caffeine poisoning may result in atrial fibrillation, especially in predisposed patients with underlying hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

Abstract: The neurological prognosis of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is extremely poor, particularly in patients who require prolonged cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). However, the upper limit of CPR duration is unclear. We present a case of a 51-year-old man with nonhypothermic OHCA. He was discharged without neurological sequelae despite long duration CPR lasting 143 minutes, which is the longest duration among adult nonhypothermic OHCA cases reported. There are some patients for whom CPR duration might not be associated with prognosis. To determine when to terminate resuscitative efforts or whether more lifesaving medical resources should be provided, a prognostic indicator other than CPR duration is needed.

Abstract: Cardiac tumors can lead to distinct electrocardiographic changes and ventricular arrhythmias. Benign and malignant cardiac tumors have been associated with ventricular tachycardia. When possible, benign tumors should be resected when ventricular arrhythmias are intractable. Chemotherapy can shrink malignant tumors and eliminate arrhythmias. We report the case of a 52-year-old woman with breast sarcoma whom we diagnosed with myocardial metastasis after she presented with palpitations. The initial electrocardiogram revealed sinus rhythm with new right bundle branch block and ST-segment elevation in the anterior precordial leads. During telemetry, hemodynamically stable, sustained ventricular tachycardia with right ventricular localization was detected. Images showed a myocardial mass in the right ventricular free wall. Amiodarone suppressed the arrhythmia. To our knowledge, this is the first report of ventricular tachycardia associated with radiation-induced undifferentiated sarcoma. We discuss the distinct electrocardiographic changes and ventricular arrhythmias that can be associated with cardiac tumors, and we review the relevant medical literature.

Abstract: A 77-year-old female patient with symptomatic atrial fibrillation with fast ventricular rate despite conventional antiarrhythmic therapy was treated with dronedarone. Five days later, she developed a maculopapulous exanthema and small flaccid blisters, which spread over the common integument predominantly located on the dorsal trunk. Over few days, the patient showed a severe epidermal necrolysis of approximately 30 % of the body area and ultimately died in multiorgan failure. Here, we report a rare case of toxic epidermal necrolysis during treatment with dronedarone leading to patient death.

Abstract: Torsades de pointes (TdP) is a rapid, polymorphic and usually self-terminating ventricular tachycardia associated with the long QT syndrome. Many drugs may cause prolongation of QT interval and be the trigger for TdP occurrence. We present the case of 52-year-old male who was treated with clarithromycin due to bilateral atypical pneumonia. However, on the fourth day of hospitalization he deteriorated, developed pulmonary edema and short cardiac arrest. After successful resuscitation, unfortunately amiodarone and co-trimoxazole were given causing the arrhythmic storm which required many defibrillations. The case highlights the importance of careful QT measurement, appropriate TdP treatment and difficulties resulting from the patient's disagreement for invasive treatment. We think, that knowledge of drug-induced long QT syndrome and its consequences should be widely spread not only in cardiologists, but also in others doctors.

Abstract: In the current epidemic of Ebola virus disease in western Africa, many aid workers have become infected. Some of these aid workers have been transferred to specialised hospitals in Europe and the USA for intensified treatment, providing the potential for unique insight into the clinical course of Ebola virus disease under optimised supportive measures in isolation units.
A 38-year-old male doctor who had contracted an Ebola virus infection in Sierra Leone was airlifted to University Hospital Frankfurt, Germany, on day 5 after disease onset. Within 72 h of admission to the hospital's high-level isolation unit, the patient developed signs of severe multiorgan failure, including lungs, kidneys, and gastrointestinal tract. In addition to clinical parameters, the diagnostic work-up included radiography, ultrasound, pulse contour cardiac output technology, and microbiological and clinical chemistry analyses. Respiratory failure with pulmonary oedema and biophysical evidence of vascular leak syndrome needed mechanical ventilation. The patient received a 3 day treatment course with FX06 (MChE-F4Pharma, Vienna, Austria), a fibrin-derived peptide under clinical development for vascular leak syndrome. After FX06 administration and concurrent detection of Ebola-virus-specific antibodies and a fall in viral load, vascular leak syndrome and respiratory parameters substantially improved. We gave broad-spectrum empiric antimicrobial therapy and the patient needed intermittent renal replacement therapy. The patient fully recovered.
This case report shows the feasibility of delivery of successful intensive care therapy to patients with Ebola virus disease under biosafety level 4 conditions.
The effective treatment of vascular leakage and multiorgan failure by combination of ventilatory support, antibiotic treatment, and renal replacement therapy can sustain a patient with severe Ebola virus disease until virological remission. FX06 could potentially be a valuable agent in contribution to supportive therapy.

Abstract: Fetal supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), characterized by a fetal ventricular heart rate faster than 200 beats per minute (bpm), is often diagnosed during routine fetal heart monitoring or prenatal ultrasound examinations. Clinical guidelines for management of fetal SVT have not been determined in standardized trials, nor do we have a clear sense regarding the long-term developmental outcomes and side effects of in utero antiarrhythmic therapy. We describe our approach to the treatment of refractory SVT in a fetus with hydrops using direct umbilical vein treatment with amiodarone coupled with effusion evacuation. We successfully achieved in utero resolution of SVT. There was transient amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism, which we screened for early and treated with Synthroid. Ultimately our patient had normal long-term growth and development as measured by modified Denver office checklists and Ages and Stages questionnaires. Our experience advocates for vigilant screening and management of hypothyroidism in fetuses exposed to in utero amiodarone and suggests that it is possible to achieve good outcomes in high-acuity refractory cases of SVT.

Abstract: Although pericardial effusion with afib is not rare, the combination of purulent pericardial effusion presenting as afib is not a common occurrence particularly in the developing world.The more common symptoms associated with purulent pericardial effusion are fever, dyspenia, and tachycardia. Without prompt recognition followed by antibiotics and surgical drainage, tamponade, and shock can potentially lead to death.
A 59-year-old male was transferred to our hospital for evaluation of afib with rapid rate associated with cough and dyspenia. He reported fevers, chills, cough and sputum for 1 week. Complaints included chest pain with relief upon lying down. Patient was afebrile with a pulse of 101 and blood pressure of 119/89. WBC 39,200 cells/ml. Chest X-RAY showed right lower lobe pneumonia and EKG revealed afib, rapid ventricular response, and secondary ST changes inferolaterally. Pericardial effusion and thickened pericardium were eveident on echo. Patient was treated for community acquired pneumonia, along with heparin and IV amiodarone. Both sputum cultures and pericardiocentesis revealed S. Pneumoniae. Cardioversion reestablished sinus mechanism. Intially pericardial effusion resolved, but later reaccumulated at which point it was decided to perform a subxiphoid pericardial window. Follow up showed no effusion and patient was asymptomatic.
Purulent pericardial effusion with atrial fibrillation and rapid ventricular rate needs to be recognized promptly. Because friction fub and chest pain are not present in every case, prompt management in the setting of pneumonia and minor hemodynamic derangements can aid in the treatment of this potentially life threating disease.

Abstract: A 69-year-old man presented with a 6-week history of shortness of breath on exertion, unintentional weight loss, altered bowel habits and lethargy. He was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation 2 years previously and started on amiodarone and warfarin. He subsequently reverted to sinus rhythm and his medication was stopped 1 year prior to presentation. He denied history of thyroid dysfunction. On examination, he had a small firm goitre of grade I. His skin was warm and sweaty. Thyroid function tests showed him to be thyrotoxic. He was started on carbimazole 20 mg; however, he further became significantly thyrotoxic. Given the severity of his presentation and lack of any clinical or biochemical improvement, oral prednisolone 30 mg once daily was coadministered. His symptoms subsequently resolved and he became euthyroid. The prednisolone was tapered down and stopped while the carbimazole was incrementally reduced to 10 mg daily.

Abstract: The accessibility and usage of body building supplements is on the rise with stronger internet marketing strategies by the industry. The dangers posed by the ingredients in them are underestimated. A healthy young man came to the emergency room with palpitations and feeling unwell. Initial history and clinical examination were non-contributory to find the cause. ECG showed atrial fibrillation. A detailed history for any over the counter or herbal medicine use confirmed that he was taking supplements to bulk muscle. One of the components in these supplements is yohimbine; the onset of symptoms coincided with the ingestion of this product and the patient is symptom free after stopping it. This report highlights the dangers to the public of consuming over the counter products with unknown ingredients and the consequential detrimental impact on health.

Abstract: Amiodarone is one of the most frequently prescribed antiarrhythmic agents. Despite its widespread use, it is associated with systemic side effects. Pulmonary toxicity, the most severe adverse effect of amiodarone, has usually been described in the context of chronic amiodarone use. We report a case of an 80-year-old male presenting acutely following right upper lung lobe resection for stage 1b adenocarcinoma. He developed atrial fibrillation on postoperative day four and received 12.5 g of amiodarone within a 12 day period. On presentation, he had new bilateral lung opacities and a 35% absolute decline in the predicted diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide. Pulmonary embolism was ruled out on chest computed tomography. Amiodarone was discontinued and prednisone was initiated. Despite initial improvement, he suffered from multiple hypoxemic episodes until his death in the fourth month. In a subset of patients undergoing thoracic surgery who are intubated and require high levels of oxygen, the risk of amiodarone lung toxicity increases and patients may present acutely.

Abstract: A 68-year-old woman was transferred from a regional hospital with recurrent polymorphic ventricular tachycardia associated with haemodynamic instability. A diagnosis of severe aortic stenosis (AS) with normal left ventricular systolic function had recently been established on echocardiography. Correction of hypokalaemia and intravenous amiodarone infusion were ineffective. On transfer, ongoing ventricular arrhythmias requiring repeat defibrillation occurred. Urgent coronary angiography was unremarkable. Following consultation with the cardiosurgical team, emergency bridging balloon aortic valvuloplasty (BAV) was performed. Two weeks later the patient proceeded to an uneventful inpatient surgical aortic valve replacement (AVR). This case highlights an unusual presentation of severe AS, and describes the use of emergency BAV to correct arrhythmia-induced haemodynamic instability prior to surgical AVR.

Abstract: Amiodarone is a class III antiarrhythmic drug widely used for the treatment of both supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias in intensive care unit. Hepatotoxicity of amiodarone is usually mild and delayed onset. Acute hepatotoxicity is a rare side effect and usually correlated to intravenous form use. In this case, acute hepatocellular injury occurred within 24 hours after the administration of intravenous amiodarone. Liver enzyme significantly improved after holding intravenous amiodarone use. Because ventricular arrhythmia persisted and side effects occurred to alternative therapy, low dose of oral amiodarone was resumed and hepatotoxicity did not occur afterward. Acute hepatotoxicity of intravenous amiodarone is possibly related to polysorbate 80, the solubilizer of amiodarone infusion or higher dose. As a result, when intravenous amiodarone is prescribed, closely monitoring liver enzyme is highly suggested. If acute hepatitis takes place secondary to intravenous amiodarone, oral therapy should not be resumed afterward. If there is no alternative treatment, lower dose of oral amiodarone (≤200 mg/d) could be tried and should monitor liver function regularly.

Abstract: Brugada syndrome predisposes individuals to ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death, in the absence of structural heart disease. The typical Brugada electrocardiogram (ECG) phenotype is often concealed in affected population, and the existing genetic testing is capable of detecting just about 20% of cases. Therefore, the diagnosis largely requires various pharmacological provocative agents like class I antiarrhythmic drugs to unmask the unique features of Brugada ECG phenotype. We report an unusual case of "unmasking" of Brugada ECG pattern with ventricular tachycardia brought out by amiodarone infusion.

Abstract: Cardiac pseudoneoplasms are rare and benign. According to World Health Organization, they are classified as tumor-like lesions. We report two patients with recurrent ventricular tachycardia (VT) in whom magnetic resonance imaging revealed a pathological mass occupying a large part of the left ventricle. The localization of both tumors precluded the possibility of resection; thus, only surgical biopsy was performed. After deducting the prospect of malignancy of the tumors, we treated both patients with amiodarone and implantation of a cardioverter-defibrillator [implanted cardioverter/defibrillator (ICD)]. VT is one of many probable symptoms indicating a tumor within the heart; therefore, treatment with an ICD should only be considered after a more thorough diagnosis.

Abstract: Thyroid crisis, also known as thyroid storm, is a rare complication of thyrotoxicosis that results in a hypermetabolic and hyperadrenergic state. This condition requires prompt recognition and treatment because the mortality from thyroid crisis approaches 30%. Thyrotoxicosis alone will usually not progress to thyroid crisis. Thyroid crisis will typically be precipitated by some concomitant event such as infection, iodine-containing contrast agents, medications such as amiodarone, pregnancy, or surgery. Trauma is a rare precipitator of thyroid crisis. Several published studies have reported thyroid crisis resulting from blunt or penetrating neck trauma. Significant systemic trauma, such as motor vehicle accidents, has also been reported to precipitate thyroid crisis. It is very unusual for minor trauma to precipitate thyroid crisis. In the present study, we report the case of a patient who had incurred relatively minor maxillofacial trauma and developed thyroid crisis 2 weeks after the initial trauma.

Abstract: Methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) is commonly used for chronic pain control and for substitution in heroin addicts undergoing rehabilitation. Methadone is known to prolong QT interval and sometimes cause torsade de pointes (TdP) and ventricular fibrillation (VF). Treatment of TdP by antiarrhythmic drugs that prolong QT interval may worsen TdP. To our knowledge, worsening of methadone-induced TdP by amiodarone has not been reported before. We describe here a case of methadone-induced TdP that deteriorated into ventricular fibrillation upon treatment with intravenous (IV) amiodarone and resolved after discontinuation of amiodarone and treatment with IV magnesium, potassium, and lidocaine.

Abstract: Enterovirus infections are common in the neonatal period. Newborns are at a higher risk of severe disease including meningoencephalitis, sepsis syndrome, cardiovascular collapse, or hepatitis. The mechanism of heart failure in patients with enterovirus infection remains unknown. Early diagnosis may help clinicians predict complications in those infants initially presenting with severe disease. An 11-day-old male newborn was admitted to our neonatal intensive care unit because of tachycardia and crises of cyanosis. His elder brother had febrile illness. The newborn was cyanotic, in respiratory distress, with tachycardia, low blood pressure and prolonged capillary refilling time. Limb pulse oximeter was around 85%. During the first day of hospitalization, the newborn had one febrile episode. Laboratory data: elevated transaminases, markers of inflammation negative, all bacterial cultures negative. Enterovirus RNA was detected in blood sample. Other blood findings were without significant abnormalities. Electrocardiogram showed tachycardia, with narrow QRS complexes (atrial tachycardia) and heart rate up to 280/min. In order to convert the rhythm, the patient was administered adenosine and amiodarone. In the further course of hospitalization, the patient was in good general condition, eucardiac and eupneic. Newborns with tachycardia and a family history of febrile illness should be suspected to have enterovirus infection. Enterovirus infection is a highly contagious and potentially life-threatening infection if not detected early. The use of sensitive molecular-based amplification methods offers potential benefits for early diagnosis and timely treatment.

Abstract: A 73-year-old woman with atrial fibrillation treated with Amiodarone presented with Optic Disc oedema in right eye (OD). Using Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) we describe the impact of this neuropathy on Retinal Nerve Fibre Layer (RNFL). At diagnosis RNFL average was of 188 μm OD and 77 μm in the left eye (OS), six months after discontinuation of the drug decreased to 40 μm in OD and 76 μm in OS. The RNFL average of OD presented a transient increase during the acute oedema that returned to normal levels during the first month after discontinuation of the drug and fell dramatically to 44 μm at the second month and 40 μm at the sixth month. We show there is axonal loss after amiodarone-associated optic neuropathy measured with OCT. The OCT may be used in these patients to document changes in RNFL in the follow-up.

Abstract: We report a case of amiodarone-induced epididymitis and review the pertinent literature. This disease is currently a diagnosis of exclusion and is believed to be self-limiting. We found new evidence for the pathological diagnosis and identified amiodarone-like crystals in the epididymis as a pathological mechanism of this disease. This case also suggests that amiodarone-induced epididymitis is not self-limiting. Continued use of amiodarone according to the current guidelines led to a bilateral epididymectomy. We recommend withdrawal or reduction of amiodarone dosage immediately once the signs and symptoms of epididymitis present in this population of patients. When epididymitis does not seem to be caused by an infection or any other identifiable etiology, this should not be overlooked by the cardiologist, urologist or general practitioner. These findings and recommendations should help reduce the suffering of patients and improve their clinical outcomes.

Abstract: Pneumotoxic drugs like amiodarone and m-TOR inhibitors (m-TORi) may be administered contemporaneously in therapy for patients who had renal transplants. We present a case of amiodarone pulmonary toxicity (APT) in a patient treated with amiodarone and everolimus. A 57-year-old Caucasian male, under treatment with both everolimus (for 3 years) and amiodarone (for 2 months), presented with fever, dyspnoea and a negative chest X-ray after his second kidney transplant with suboptimal serum creatinine (3 mg/dl). A non-contrastive high-resolution CT scan showed bilateral interstitial lung disease with an associated reduction in carbon monoxide diffusing capacity. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was negative for an infection, but BAL cytology was suitable for APT (50% of 'foamy' macrophages). A complete recovery was achieved after amiodarone interruption and an oral steroid therapy increase. Everolimus was continued. His kidney function remained unchanged in the upcoming months. In conclusion, we suggest a possible synergistic effect between m-TORi and amiodarone. Furthermore, we propose a diagnostic algorithm that can be used as a surveillance tool to identify a potential initial lung damage in patients treated with 1 or more pneumotoxic drugs.

Abstract: Mutations in SCN5A, which encodes the cardiac sodium channel NaV1.5, typically cause ventricular arrhythmia or conduction slowing. Recently, SCN5A mutations have been associated with heart failure combined with variable atrial and ventricular arrhythmia.
The purpose of this study was to determine the clinical, genetic, and functional features of an amiodarone-responsive multifocal ventricular ectopy-related cardiomyopathy associated with a novel mutation in a NaV1.5 voltage sensor domain.
A novel, de novo SCN5A mutation (NaV1.5-R225P) was identified in a boy with prenatal arrhythmia and impaired cardiac contractility followed by postnatal multifocal ventricular ectopy suppressible by amiodarone. We investigated the functional consequences of NaV1.5-R225P expressed heterologously in tsA201 cells.
Mutant channels exhibited significant abnormalities in both activation and inactivation leading to large, hyperpolarized window and ramp currents that predict aberrant sodium influx at potentials near the cardiomyocyte resting membrane potential. Mutant channels also exhibited significantly increased persistent (late) sodium current. This profile of channel dysfunction shares features with other SCN5A voltage sensor mutations associated with cardiomyopathy and overlapped that of congenital long QT syndrome. Amiodarone stabilized fast inactivation, suppressed persistent sodium current, and caused frequency-dependent inhibition of channel availability.
We determined the functional consequences and pharmacologic responses of a novel SCN5A mutation associated with an arrhythmia-associated cardiomyopathy. Comparisons with other cardiomyopathy-associated NaV1.5 voltage sensor mutations revealed a pattern of abnormal voltage dependence of activation as a shared biophysical mechanism of the syndrome.

Abstract: Platypnoea orthodeoxia is a rare clinical syndrome characterised by dyspnoea and deoxygenation exhibited in upright position with improvement in supine posture. Previously described aetiologies include cardiac (pericardial effusion or constrictive pericarditis), pulmonary (pneumonectomy, emphysema or amiodarone toxicity), abdominal (cirrhosis or ileus) or vascular (abdominal aortic aneurysm) causes. We report an unusual case of platypnoea orthodeoxia associated with patent foramen ovale and partial hepatic resection.

Abstract: We describe postoperative refractory ventricular tachycardia (VT) in a patient following aortic and mitral valve replacement. Following an uneventful separation from cardiopulmonary bypass with dobutamine, the patient developed recurrent VT, 4 hours into the postoperative period. The VT did not respond to standard doses of xylocard, magnesium and amiodarone. Electrolyte and acid base parameters were normal. Multiple cardioversions failed to revert back to a stable rhythm. Intra-aortic balloon pumping was instituted and overdrive right ventricular pacing was unsuccessful. Following intravenous sotalol 80 mg, the VT came under control and reverted to a nodal rhythm, which required atrial pacing for the next 8 hours. Oral sotalol therapy was continued at 40 mg daily. The VT did not recur.

Abstract: A 62-year-old man was found to have bradycardia, hypothermia and respiratory failure 3 weeks after initiation of amiodarone therapy for atrial fibrillation. Thyroid-stimulating hormone was found to be 168 μIU/mL (nl. 0.3-5 μIU/mL) and free thyroxine (FT4) was <0.2 ng/dL (nl. 0.8-1.8 ng/dL). He received intravenous fluids, vasopressor therapy and stress dose steroids; he was intubated and admitted to the intensive care unit. He received 500 μg of intravenous levothyroxine in the first 18 h of therapy, and 150 µg intravenous daily thereafter. Haemodynamic improvement, along with complete recovery of mental status, occurred after 48 h. Twelve hours after the initiation of therapy, FT4 was 0.96 ng/dL. The patient was maintained on levothyroxine 175 (g POorally daily. A thyroid ultrasound showed diffuse heterogeneity. The 24 hour excretion of iodine was 3657 (mcg (25-756 ( mcg). The only two cases of amiodarone-induced myxoedema coma in the literature report patient death despite supportive therapy and thyroid hormone replacement. This case represents the most thoroughly investigated case of amiodarone-induced myxoedema coma with a history significant for subclinical thyroid disease.

Abstract: Amiodarone is an effective drug for life-threatening arrhythmias like recurrent ventricular fibrillation and atrial fibrillation. Amiodarone creates rarely genitourinary side effects are seen. These are epididymitis, testicular dysfunction and impotance. Amiodarone aggregates and triggers inflammation in the head of the epididym.
We present the case of a patient who developed epididymitis after 17 months of amiodarone therapy, using a low dose (100 mg per day). Although cessation of medication or dose lowering was not performed, remission of the patient only by analgesics is a distinct case reported in urological literature.
This case stresses the importance of considering an adverse effect of amiodarone treatment as a cause when making a differential diagnosis of epididymitis.

Abstract: The overall incidence of obesity and its prevalence is increasing continuously. The obesity is a cardiovascular risk factor whose importance is increasing too. It is associated with many chronic conditions such as type II diabetes mellitus or cardiovascular diseases. The obesity is also implicated as a risk factor for several kinds of cancer such as esophagus, pancreas, colon, rectum, breast cancer in menopausal women. The treatment of the obesity may reduce the incidence of these diseases. The mainstray of the treatment of obesity is changing the lifestyles, but obesity´s treatment may need drug therapy or even though surgical treatment. Orlistat is a specific inhibitor of gastrointestinal lipases, which stops fat absortion. It is used along with a hypocaloric diet, for obesity´s treatment. The beneficial effects of orlistat include weight loss, the improvement of blood pressure´s control, it may delay the development of diabetes mellitus, and it may reduce HbA1c.
Besides the interaction with other drugs (mainly warfarin and amiodarone). Orlistat´s mainly side effects are gastrointestinal disorders such as the existence of oily spotting from the rectum, abdominal pain or discomfort, fecal urgency. There are also side effects at other levels, like flu symptoms, hypoglycemia, heathache or upper respiratory infections. There are other side effects with very low incidence but clinically relevant like pancreatitis, subacute liver failure, severe liver disease, myopathy, or tubular necrosis secondary to oxalate nephropathy induced by Orlistat.
IN THIS CASE REPORT APPEARS A NEW ADVERSE EFFECT OF ORLISTAT THAT HAS NOT BEEN DESCRIBED ABOVE: thrombopenia and macrocytic anemia.

Abstract: Amiodarone-induced SIADH is a rare but serious side effect of this drug. We report two cases of mild hyponatremia, observed in the last five years, and discuss the role played by age, sex and dose of amiodarone as well as the influence that this molecule may have on aquaporin-2 water channel expression in the renal collecting ducts.

Abstract: Amiodarone is a highly effective antiarrhythmic agent. Unfortunately amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity is described for medium-long term therapy. We describe a case of a 65-year-old man admitted to our department for breathlessness and with a history of recurrent episodes of atrial fibrillation for which he had been receiving amiodarone (200 mg/day) since 2008. Despite diuretic therapy, along with aspirin, statins and antibiotics the patient continued to complain of severe dyspnea and had a moderate fever. Thus, diagnostic hypotheses different from acute cardiac failure were considered, in particular non-cardiogenic causes of pulmonary infiltrates. Following suspicion of amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity, the drug was discontinued and corticosteroid therapy was initiated. Due to the deterioration of the clinical picture, we proceeded to intubation. After few hours from intubation we were forced to institute a veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation due to the worsening of pulmonary function. The patient's clinical condition improved which allowed us to remove the ECMO after 15 days of treatment. Indications for use of ECMO have expanded considerably. To our knowledge this is the first successful, reported article of a veno-venous ECMO used to treat amiodarone-induced toxicity in an adult. In patients with severe but potentially reversible pulmonary toxicity caused by amiodarone, extracorporeal life support can maintain pulmonary function and vital organ perfusion at the expense of low morbidity, while allowing time for drug clearance.

Abstract: Atrial fibrillation is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia which is often troublesome to manage. Currently, rhythm and rate control medications are the mainstays of therapy. In 2 amiodarone-refractory highly symptomatic patients, an innovative approach using ranolazine, which selectively acts on Na+ channels and delays atrial depolarization, was tried successfully.

Abstract: The widespread use of amiodarone is limited by its toxicity, notably to the optic nerve. We report two cases of bilateral optic nerve neuropathy due to amiodarone, and provide a detailed description of the disease.
The first case was a 59-year-old man complaining from insidious monocular loss of vision within ten months of initiating amiodarone. Funduscopy and optical coherence tomography showed bilateral optic disc edema. The second case was a 72-year-old man presenting with a decrease in visual acuity in his left eye for a month. Funduscopy showed a left optic nerve edema, and fluorescein angiography showed bilateral papillitis. In both cases, the clinical presentation was not suggestive of ischemic neuropathy, because of the preservation of visual acuity and the insidious onset. In addition, both cardiovascular and inflammatory work-up were normal. An amiodarone-associated neuropathy was suspected, and amiodarone was discontinued with the approval of the cardiologist, with complete regression of the papilledema and a stabilization of visual symptoms.
Differentiating between amiodarone-associated optic neuropathy and anterior ischemic optic neuropathy may be complicated by the cardiovascular background of such patients. The major criterion is the absence of a severe decrease in visual acuity; other criteria are the normality of cardiovascular and inflammatory work-up, and the improvement or the absence of worsening of symptoms after discontinuation of amiodarone.
Amiodarone-associated neuropathy remains a diagnosis of exclusion, and requires amiodarone discontinuation, which can only be done with the approval of a cardiologist, and sometimes requires replacement therapy.

Abstract: Eisenmenger's syndrome is a condition due to any congenital heart defect with an intracardiac left-to-right communication that leads to pulmonary hypertension with reversed right-to-left blood flow and secondary cyanosis. The main complications of Eisenmenger's syndrome are heart failure and arrhythmias. Amiodarone, the drug of choice for arrhythmia treatment in such patients, can cause a number of complications, including amiodarone induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT). Hereby, we present a 41-year-old patient with Eisenmenger's syndrome who developed AIT and was successfully treated with radioactive iodine therapy. The patient had an accompanying heart failure and had been treated with amiodarone due to chronic atrial fibrillation. Twenty months later he developed an AIT for which was treated with 814 MBq (22 mCi) radioactive iodine. Since 7 weeks later only a slight decline in thyroid hormones was observed, the patient was received a transient treatment with methimazole, which had to be withdrawn soon due to severe leucopenia. Because of the need to maintain amiodarone, a second ablative radioactive iodine dose was administered leading to complete clinical remission. In conclusion, this case demonstrates that even though amiodarone reduces iodine uptake to a very low level, the therapy with radioactive iodine can be still effective if it is given in a repeated dose to patients who require continuation of amiodarone.

Abstract: Two cases of mothers given postpartum short-term administration of amiodarone, with and without bisoprolol, are described along with determinations of amiodarone and (±)-bisoprolol in the breast milk. In one mother given a cumulative total of amiodarone of 8 g over 1 week, concentrations 11 days after the drug had been stopped were initially deemed sufficient to pose a risk to an infant. Over the next 5 days the concentrations steadily dropped with amiodarone and desethylamiodarone concentrations being found to be at a level comprising minimal risk to the infant. Bisoprolol was not found in the expressed breast milk. In the second case the mother was given a single 150 mg dose of amiodarone and breast milk concentrations were measured on postpartum days 4 and 5. Breast milk amiodarone concentrations were very low and of little concern clinically had the mother breast fed her baby. The risk to the baby of ingesting breast milk after amiodarone administration postpartum depends on the duration of amiodarone exposure, with a single dose posing minimal risk. Bisoprolol does not appear to accumulate to any great extent in breast milk.

Abstract: Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is a leading cause of death in the United States. Ventricular fibrillation (VF) is the most common initial rhythm after cardiac arrest.
To describe a novel approach to the patient with intractable VF after cardiac arrest.
A 51-year old man presented in cardiac arrest after a ST-elevation myocardial infarction. He remained in VF despite receiving typical therapy including cardiopulmonary resuscitation, amiodarone, lidocaine, epinephrine, and five attempts at defibrillation with 200 J using a biphasic defibrillator. VF was eventually terminated with 400 J by the simultaneous use of two biphasic defibrillators. The patient had a full recovery.
We present a case and supportive literature for a novel treatment of high-energy defibrillation in a patient with refractory VF.

Abstract: Cardiac rhabdomyoma (CR) is a rare tumor commonly associated with tuberous sclerosis. They are often detected prenatally or in early infancy. The case of a Nigerian human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-exposed neonate with CR who presented with supraventricular tachycardia and cardiovascular collapse is presented. The infant was born to a mother on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). The possible role of HIV and HAART in CR etiology and the difficulty in the management of this case are highlighted.

Abstract: Early graft failure after CABG surgery may lead to severe adverse events and death. Because the cause of the graft failure can vary, rapid diagnostic management is mandatory in order to address these complications appropriately. In the present 2 cases, patients who underwent CABG procedures showed typical electrocardiograms and serology of a perioperative myocardial ischemia shortly after surgery. In the first case, a rapidly performed coronary angiogram revealed a torqued right CABG, which was detorqued and, in order to avoid further torsion, fixated to the pericardium in a redo procedure. In the second case, the patient underwent a revascularization by means of percutaneous coronary intervention with stent implantation for severe stenosis due to a localized dissection of the vein graft, diagnosed on coronary angiogram. The further postoperative course of both patients was smooth and both could be discharged on day 8 and 11 after initial surgery, respectively.

Abstract: Acute heart failure related to anaphylactic shock is often reversible and necessitates aggressive support to ensure full recovery. We report the case of a 15-year-old boy who developed severe ventricular dysfunction and haemodynamic instability after administration of amiodarone and required temporary mechanical circulatory support with a left ventricular assist device. He had full recovery of cardiac function and returned to baseline neurologic status. This is the first report of successful left ventricular assist device use for recovery from cardiovascular collapse due to anaphylaxis.

Abstract: To report 3 cases of reversible hypothyroidism-induced kidney dysfunction and review the interaction between these commonly encountered, yet seemingly disparate, conditions.
We describe the clinical course and laboratory and physical findings of 3 patients who presented with kidney dysfunction that improved after initiating thyroid hormone replacement therapy. We also review similar cases in the literature and discuss the pathophysiologic mechanisms.
A 68-year-old male presented with classical signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism, including fatigue, confusion, and gait imbalance. Physical exam showed bradycardia, thyromegaly, slow mentation, and cracked, thin skin; he was found to have decreased kidney function. Second, a 42-year-old previously healthy female presented with bilateral hand swelling and elevated serum creatinine with an otherwise unremarkable physical exam. The third patient was a 72-year-old male with advanced heart failure on amiodarone and stage 3 chronic kidney disease who presented with fatigue, acute kidney injury, and lower extremity edema. In all cases, serum creatinine and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) were elevated at presentation (1.4-3.0 mg/dL and 94.1-184 mIU/L respectively), and free thyroxine (T4) was low (undetectable-0.4 ng/dL). The initiation or increased dose of levothyroxine normalized serum creatinine to baseline within 2 to 10 months.
Hypothyroidism and kidney dysfunction are both commonly encountered clinical entities, but the interplay between the thyroid gland and kidneys may be infrequently recalled, causing the reversible relationship between these 2 disorders to be missed.

Abstract: Therapy for HIV often can make pharmacologic management of comorbidities challenging since many antiretroviral agents significantly modulate drug metabolism pathways. Amiodarone is commonly used to control cardiac arrhythmias; however, it is recognized as having a narrow therapeutic window with potential for significant drug toxicity. Amiodarone is metabolized by CYP3A4, CYP2C8 and CYP1A1 to an active metabolite and therefore may be affected by comedications that modulate these isoenzymes. Since amiodarone is frequently associated with toxicity, the Heart Rhythm Society (formerly the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology) developed guidelines to minimize the potential for adverse events. However, recommendations for the management of situations where amiodarone must be given with a drug that significantly affects its metabolism are lacking. This paper will discuss our experience with a case of concurrent amiodarone and antiretroviral therapy, as well as provide a review of interactions that may lead to toxicity or potential treatment failure with amiodarone. Primary literature was identified through Medline (1946 to May 2013) and Embase (1980 to May 2013), using the following terms: amiodarone, antiretroviral, HIV, cytochrome P450 and drug interaction. Case reports, studies of xenobiotic interactions with amiodarone in healthy volunteers, and in vitro studies that investigated metabolic pathways of amiodarone were reviewed. Although clinical data was limited, several cases support the finding that potent inhibitors or inducers of cytochrome P450 may lead to amiodarone toxicity or lack of therapeutic effect, respectively. As well, several case reports, in vitro data and clinical investigations have associated some of the antiretrovirals with QT prolongation, which may result in additive cardiotoxicity in patients also receiving amiodarone. Therefore, to manage situations where amiodarone must be used with concurrent interacting antiretrovirals, we recommend a monitoring plan that follows the Heart Rhythm Society guidelines, however with the addition of serial therapeutic drug level monitoring and frequent electrocardiography to minimize potential toxicity and successfully manage both conditions.

Abstract: We report a case of a 68 year-old-female patient with clinical features of drug-induced lupus erythematosus after five years of treatment with amiodarone. She presented generalized skin rash, arthralgia on upper and lower extremities, associated with difficulty to walk. Remarkable laboratory results revealed a positive antinuclear antibody test and a skin rash biopsy showing a superficial and deep perivascular infiltrate of lymphocytes, histiocytes, and eosinophils. Once the etiology of the patient's symptoms was identified, the culprit drug was removed and she had a complete remission of all signs and symptoms. Early diagnose should be recognized for prompt intervention and avoid further complications associated with this rare side-effect.

Abstract: Amiodarone is associated with thyroid dysfunction and life-threatening thyrotoxicosis. In medically refractory cases, or where medical therapy is contraindicated, thyroidectomy may be required. To decrease perioperative thyroid storm and to reduce overall surgical risk, apheresis may be considered preoperatively to restore euthyroidism.
We report a 46-year-old female with a history of cardiac arrhythmia and tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy for which she received amiodarone. Months after discontinuation of amiodarone, the patient presented with wide complex tachycardia and symptoms of thyrotoxicosis. Laboratory testing confirmed severe thyrotoxicosis which was subsequently refractory to medical therapy. Total thyroidectomy was required. Following a total of 10 apheresis treatments, thyroid hormone levels were reduced to near normal levels and the patient's symptoms improved. Thyroidectomy was performed without intraoperative or postoperative complication.
In the setting of life-threatening, medically refractory amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis, therapeutic apheresis can effectively reduce thyroid hormone levels and restore a state of clinical and biochemical euthyroidism.

Abstract: Amiodarone is a Class III antiarrhythmic agent used for cardioversion and prevention of recurrences of atrial fibrillation. However, its use is limited due to its side-effects resulting from the drug's long-term administration. We have described acute epigastric pain following treatment with intravenous amiodarone for atrial fibrillation in a previous report. Hereby, we describe a second patient who suffered acute epigastric pain, as well as one who suffered acute low back pain. Intravenous amiodarone has been related to a series of minor and major adverse reactions, indicating other constituents of the intravenous solution as the possible cause, possibly polysorbate-80. A possible correlation between acute epigastric and low back pain after intravenous amiodarone loading is unproven; however it is of crucial importance for clinicians to be aware of this phenomenon, and especially since an acute epigastric pain is implicated in the differential diagnosis of cardiac ischemia.

Abstract: The Holter function of implanted devices will record events with characteristics meeting criteria determined by the manufacturer or programmed by the physician. It does not show a continuous ECG. It is reliable, provided the basic functions of the device are operating correctly. This is an ideal tool for assessing the electrophysiologic profile of heart disease patients with implants and to assess the efficacy of various treatments (anti-arrhythmic drugs, ablation procedures). Combined with telemedicine technology, it can provide early alerts to the physician about deterioration in the rhythmic or hemodynamic status of their patients and thus prevent complications that would otherwise have led to costly hospitalizations. It is a very reliable tool to assess ICD function (diagnostic capabilities by the discrimination algorithms and efficacy of the delivered therapies). The technology will evolve and offer extended data in the future, such as sensor information or repolarization data (ST segment, QT duration, variability, &c.).

Abstract: A 64-year-old female was diagnosed with systemic amyloidosis associated with multiple myeloma. Bortezomib and dexamethasone-therapy was initiated; however, she developed lethal ventricular fibrillation (VF) and cardiac arrest after 84 hours of therapy. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation using direct current shocks with epinephrine and amiodarone was initiated but failed to receive cardiac function. Although her arterial pulsations recovered immediately after the injection of vasopressin, she died of heart failure 8 hours after the onset of VF. Cardiac amyloidosis was verified by autopsy. Although the direct association of bortezomib with lethal VF remained to be clarified in our patient, the current report emphasizes on bortezomib as a substantial risk factor for cardiomyocyte damage. The potential risk of lethal events associated with cardiac amyloidosis should be carefully considered during bortezomib treatment for patients with AL amyloidosis.

Abstract: Amiodarone is a benzofuran class III antiarrhythmic drug used to treat a wide spectrum of ventricular tachyarrhythmias. The parenteral formulation is prepared in polysorbate 80 diluent. We report an unusual case of acute elevation of aminotransaminase concentrations after the initiation of intravenous amiodarone. An 88-year-old Caucasian female developed acute hepatitis and renal failure after initiating intravenous amiodarone for atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response in the setting of acutely decompensated heart failure and hepatic congestion. Liver transaminases returned to baseline within 7 days after discontinuing the drug. Researchers hypothesized that this type of injury is related to liver ischemia with possible superimposed direct drug toxicity. The CIOMS/RUCAM scale identifies our patient's acute hepatitis as a highly probable adverse drug reaction. Future research is needed to understand the mechanisms by which hyperacute drug toxicity occurs in the setting of impaired hepatic perfusion and venous congestion.

Abstract: A 79-year-old woman presented with lower extremity weakness and unsteadiness for 2 weeks. She was recently diagnosed with refractory atrial flutter and was prescribed amiodarone. Physical examination revealed signs of cerebellar dysfunction. Neuroimaging including CT and MRI were unremarkable. Her hospital course included the development of ventricular tachycardia necessitating increment in amiodarone dose. Laboratory studies were unremarkable except mild transaminitis. Other workup including the one for paraneoplastic neurological involvement was negative. The patient experienced worsening of ataxia requiring assistance with ambulation. In view of comprehensive routine negative work-up for ataxia, recent use of amiodarone and worsening of symptomatology with increase in its dosing, drug-induced neurotoxicity from amiodarone was suspected. Amiodarone dose was subsequently reduced and mexilitine was introduced as an additive antiarrhythmic therapy for ventricular tachycardia. In follow-up, the patient experienced significant improvement in her symptoms and was able to ambulate independently. She was subsequently discharged to short-term rehabilitation.

Abstract: Amiodarone is an effective medication for the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias. Originally developed for the treatment of angina, it is now the most frequently prescribed antiarrhythmia drug despite the fact that its use is limited because of potential serious side effects including adverse effects on the thyroid gland and thyroid hormones. Although the mechanisms of action of amiodarone on the thyroid gland and thyroid hormone metabolism are poorly understood, the structural similarity of amiodarone to thyroid hormones, including the presence of iodine moieties on the inner benzene ring, may play a role in causing thyroid dysfunction. Amiodarone-induced thyroid dysfunction includes amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) and amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism (AIH). The AIT develops more commonly in iodine-deficient areas and AIH in iodine-sufficient areas. The AIT type 1 usually occurs in patients with known or previously undiagnosed thyroid dysfunction or goiter. The AIT type 2 usually occurs in normal thyroid glands and results in destruction of thyroid tissue caused by thyroiditis. This is the result of an intrinsic drug effect from the amiodarone itself. Mixed types are not uncommon. Patients with cardiac disease receiving amiodarone treatment should be monitored for signs of thyroid dysfunction, which often manifest as a reappearance of the underlying cardiac disease state. When monitoring patients, initial tests should include the full battery of thyroid function tests, thyroid-stimulating hormone, thyroxine, triiodothyronine, and antithyroid antibodies. Mixed types of AIT can be challenging both to diagnose and treat and therapy differs depending on the type of AIT. Treatment can include thionamides and/or glucocorticoids. The AIH responds favorably to thyroid hormone replacement therapy. Amiodarone is lipophilic and has a long half-life in the body. Therefore, stopping the amiodarone therapy usually has little short-term benefit.

Abstract: We herein report a rare autopsy case of tako-tsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC) presenting ventricular tachycardia after pacemaker implantation. A 69-year-old male received a dual-chamber pacemaker implantation for complete atrioventricular block. He had no chest symptoms after the operation. Three days later, he developed severe chest pain, followed by syncope. Electrocardiogram showed sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia. Despite the use of amiodarone and frequent electrical defibrillation, ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation were repeated incessantly. He died 24 h after the syncope. The autopsy revealed no hemopericardial effusion, or perforation of leads. There were also no obstructive lesions in the coronary arteries. Myocardial necrosis was observed in the entire circumference and the all layers of the left ventricle. Microscopically, myocardial necrosis was plurifocal and contraction band necrosis. We speculate that catecholamine cardiotoxicity caused ventricular tachycardia in this case. Further studies are needed to clarify the heterogeneity of this disease. <

Abstract: Phototoxicity is a skin reaction that occurs in patients using photosensitizing drugs in combination with exposure to ultraviolet light. Common photosensitizing pharmacologic agents include antibiotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, diuretics, neuroleptics, retinoids, and amiodarone. Dronaderone is a novel antiarrhythmic that is similar in composition to amiodarone, but is non-iodinated and also has a methane-sulfonyl group, significantly decreasing its incidence of adverse effects as compared to amiodarone. While phototoxicity is a commonly reported complication of amiodarone, this reaction has rarely been documented in patients using dronaderone. We report the case of a 63 year-old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation that presented with a phototoxic drug eruption following use of dronaderone for maintenance of normal sinus rhythm.

Abstract: A 5-year-old male English Bulldog was presented with a 1-year history of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) partially responsive to amiodarone. At admission the surface ECG showed sustained runs of a narrow QRS complex tachycardia, with a ventricular cycle length (R-R interval) of 260 ms, alternating with periods of sinus rhythm. Endocardial mapping identified the electrogenic mechanism of the SVT as a circus movement tachycardia with retrograde and decremental conduction along a concealed postero-septal atrioventricular pathway (AP) and anterograde conduction along the atrioventricular node. These characteristics were indicative of a permanent junctional reciprocating tachycardia (PJRT). Radiofrequency catheter ablation of the AP successfully terminated the PJRT, with no recurrence of tachycardia on Holter monitoring at 12 months follow-up.

Abstract: Amiodarone has been implicated as a cause of thrombocytopenia but the responsible mechanism is unknown. We performed studies in three patients to characterize the pathogenesis of this complication. No amiodarone-dependent, platelet-reactive antibodies were identified using conventional serological techniques. However, water-insoluble amiodarone solubilized in methanol and diluted to 1·0 mg/ml in aqueous buffer reproducibly promoted binding of IgG antibodies in patient serum to platelets. Solid phase assays identified drug-dependent antibodies specific for platelet glycoproteins (GP)Ia/IIa (integrin α2 β1 ) in each patient and a second antibody specific for GPIIb/IIIa (αII b β3 integrin) in one patient. When studied by ion mobility analysis and transmission electron microscopy, the serologically active amiodarone preparation, a milky suspension, was found to consist of particles 2-30 nm in diameter, typical of a coacervate, a state characteristic of amiodarone in aqueous medium. The findings provide evidence that thrombocytopenia in the three patients studied was caused by drug-dependent antibodies specific for platelet glycoproteins GPIa/IIa and/or GPIIb/IIIa. We postulate that, in vivo, amiodarone may become incorporated into occult lipophilic domains in platelet glycoproteins, producing structural modifications that are immunogenic in some individuals, and that the resulting antibodies can cause platelet destruction in a person taking this drug.

Abstract: Radiofrequency ablation (RFCA) became a treatment of choice in patients with recurrent ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, and appropriate interventions of implanted cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), however, electrical storm (ES) ablation in a pregnant woman has not yet been reported.
We describe a case of a successful rescue ablation of recurrent ES in a 26-year-old Caucasian woman during her first pregnancy (23rd week). The arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia/cardiomyopathy (ARVD/C) was diagnosed 3 years earlier and several drugs as well as 2 ablations failed to control recurrences of ventricular tachycardia. RFCA was performed on the day of the third electric storm. The use of electroanatomic mapping allowed very low X-ray exposure, and after applications in the right ventricular outflow tract, arrhythmia disappeared. Three months after ablation, a healthy girl was delivered without any complications. During twelve-month follow-up there was no recurrence of ventricular tachycardia or ICD interventions.
This case documents the first successful RFCA during ES due to recurrent unstable ventricular arrhythmias in a patient with ARVD/C in pregnancy. Current guidelines recommend metoprolol, sotalol and intravenous amiodarone for prevention of recurrent ventricular tachycardia in pregnancy, however, RFCA should be considered as a therapeutic option in selected cases. The use of 3D navigating system and near zero X-ray approach is associated with minimal radiation exposure for mother and fetus as well as low risk of procedural complication.

Abstract: A 45-year-old male was admitted to our hospital after successful resuscitation of cardiac arrest. Ventricular fibrillation (VF) had occurred during breakfast and was defibrillated by an automated external defibrillator operated by emergency medical service staff. On admission, his ECG demonstrated complete right bundle branch block as the sole abnormality. Intensive examination could not detect any structural disease leading to a diagnosis of idiopathic VF and implantation of an ICD. VF storm occurred one month after hospital discharge and beta-blocker, amiodarone, and sedative administration had no effect on VF. Likewise, catheter ablation for triggering premature ventricular beats failed to control the VF storm. The VF storm then subsided in the following weeks and the patient was discharged on amiodarone. A half month later VF storm recurred and the patient was admitted again. This time, isoproterenol infusion was effective in suppressing VF, and thereafter the patient was administered bepridil and followed up without recurrence of VF for 1.5 years. From these beneficial effects, the VF of the patient was suggested to share common arrhythmogenic characteristics to those of Brugada syndrome or J-wave associated VF.

Abstract: Amiodarone is a commonly prescribed and one of the most effective anti-arrhythmic drugs available. However, its use is limited by serious toxic adverse effects including optic neuropathy. Previously, amiodarone-associated optic neuropathy has been reported at an incidence of 1.3%-1.8%. Nearly, one-third of patients with amiodarone-induced toxic optic neuropathy are asymptomatic and typically visual acuity improves after drug cessation. We describe the case of a 75-year-old woman who experienced severe optic neuropathy with bilateral optic disc edema and hemorrhages, irreversible loss of vision, and severe defects in visual fields after 1.5 months use of amiodarone. The optic disc edema resolved promptly after discontinuation of the drug, but the patient remained blind permanently. This is the first report of only 6.5 weeks of amiodarone treatment resulting in bilateral optic neuropathy with bilateral and irreversible loss of vision. To ideally establish a connection between amiodarone and optic neuropathy, re-exposure of the patient to the drug should reproduce the symptoms. As a limitation of the study, this was not done in the present case because it would have been unethical. The worldwide growth of the elderly population in number is expected to increase age-related conditions including cardiac diseases. The use of cardiovascular drugs, also anti-arrhythmic agents such as amiodarone, may increase. Thus, clinicians need to be aware of the possibility of drug-induced toxic optic neuropathy, especially if a patient receiving a regimen of amiodarone complains of visual problems.

Abstract: A 62-year-old patient with chronic bronchitis had treatment-resistant atrial fibrillation. Electrical cardioversion was performed, but sinus rhythm (SR) lasted only for some minutes. Administration of amiodarone was withheld in favour of a course of acupuncture treatment in order to increase the success rate of a second attempt of electrical cardioversion. After two acupuncture treatments, spontaneous conversion to SR occurred. Relapses into atrial fibrillation in the following five winters, associated with attacks of bronchitis, also responded to acupuncture. The mechanisms of action of the acupuncture treatment and the value of this integrated approach to treatment are discussed.

Abstract: Amiodarone is used in a large number of cardiac conditions. Amiodarone-induced thyroid dysfunction has been reported to affect up to 20% of users. Amiodarone can lead to both amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism (AIH) and less commonly amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT). There are two main forms of AIT. Type 1 AIT, a form of io-dine-induced hyperthyroidism, and type 2, a drug-induced destructive thyroiditis. Type 1 AIT develops on individuals with underlying thyroid disease. Treatment of Type 1 AIT includes the use of antithyroid drugs and discontinuation of amiodarone. Type 2 AIT is commonly self-limiting in nature. In this article wedescribe a patient with Amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis discussing its clinical features and medical therapeutic approach.

Abstract: Amiodarone has been widely used in treating cardiac arrhythmias. Drug-induced lupus due to amiodarone has been rarely reported. Here, we report the rare occurrence of drug-induced lupus in a 37-year-old male shortly after the initiation of amiodarone. After cessation of drug exposure, the patient recovered completely.

Abstract: Recombinant human thyroid-stimulating hormone(rhTSH) increases radioactive iodine uptake(RAIU) in selected populations, while lithium is used as an adjunct to radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy in Graves' disease with low RAIU. In this report, both drugs used in combination, overcame low iodine-131 uptake in a Graves' patient.
A 39-year old female with Graves' disease, acquired thionamide-induced agranulocytosis, and severe hypokalemia, subsequently went into cardiorespiratory arrest. On resuscitation, she had ventricular tachyarrhythmias which were cardioverted using amiodarone. She was subsequently placed on IV hydrocortisone amiodarone and propranolol. On admission, she was normotensive, tachycardic, and afebrile. She had fine tremors, hyper reflexia, and diffuse, non-tender thyromegaly. Initial investigations showed normal complete blood count, hypokalemia and elevated alanine transaminase levels. Levels of thyroid stimulating hormone were low (0.03 uIU/L, N = 0.27-3.75). Thyroid ultrasound showed diffuse thyromegaly with uniform echopattern and normal color flow Doppler, radioiodine uptake showed low uptake at 0400h and 2400h (6% and 7%, respectively). In preparation for RAI therapy, she was given lithium 900mg/day for 12 days to increase RAI retention. To increase iodine-131 uptake, two doses of 0.9mg rhTSH were injected intramuscular, 24 hours apart, before RAI therapy. Repeat RAIU after the second dose of rhTSH showed more than a 5-fold increase in 0400h uptake compared with the baseline (32% vs. 6%). Exactly 24 hours after the second dose of rhTSH, she was given 25mCi of iodine-131. Thereafter, the patient's clinical and biochemical markers continued to improve. She became hypothyroid and is currently on levothyroxine replacement therapy.
This case demonstrates the efficacy of combining rhTSH and lithium to overcome amiodarone-induced low iodine-131 uptake in Graves' disease.

Abstract: Amiodarone is an effective treatment for atrial and ventricular arrhythmias, but its use is limited by a toxic adverse-effect profile. Although dronedarone has been touted as an antiarrhythmic agent devoid of both solid organ toxicity and proarrhythmic properties, its potential for prolonging ventricular repolarization may augment triggered ectopy. We describe a 66-year-old man who began dronedarone 400 mg twice/day for new-onset paroxysmal atrial fibrillation; he had no left ventricular dysfunction or clinical heart failure. Three months after starting the drug, he complained of malaise, fatigue, and rare palpitations. Twenty four-hour Holter monitoring revealed increased premature ventricular complexes, and the rate-corrected QT (QTc) interval was prolonged (range 525-760 msec). Dronedarone was discontinued and the patient's symptoms gradually resolved over the next 3 weeks. Holter monitoring revealed a marked reduction in ventricular ectopy burden, and the QTc interval decreased to his baseline values. Even in the absence of documented symptomatic torsade de pointes, this case suggests that caution should be exercised when prescribing dronedarone and that serial QTc interval monitoring may be appropriate. In addition, clinicians should have a low threshold to perform Holter monitoring if symptoms develop during dronedarone therapy.

Abstract: Amiodarone is often prescribed for the control of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. While generally effective, the potential for a variety of side effects is substantial. Pulmonary toxicity, leading to acute or chronic respiratory failure, manifests with cough, dyspnea, infiltrates on chest radiograph, and a potential for progression to death. Although routinely cited as an adverse effect of amiodarone, it is relatively rare in terms of statistical incidence. In an effort to shed light on this syndrome, we present a stereotypical case study in amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity, as a prelude to a review of theorized pathophysiology, epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, therapeutics, monitoring recommendations, and areas for future research.

Abstract: In cases of coronary artery spasm, life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias are possible and can lead to sudden cardiac death. Treatment for this condition includes implantable cardioverter defibrillators, but their effectiveness in patients who present with ventricular fibrillation is debated. Our patient presented with intractable ventricular fibrillation episodes that triggered shocks from her implanted defibrillator. At 2 years of follow-up, we placed her on 200 mg/day of oral amiodarone, after identifying short-coupled premature contractions as the trigger for the ventricular fibrillation. In the 2 years following initiation of this drug therapy, the patient had no further fibrillation episodes.

Abstract: To review the literature regarding the interaction among amiodarone therapy, thyroid hormone levels, and warfarin metabolism.
A 73-year-old male with type 2 after describing an unusual case of amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) who experienced a severe rise in international normalized ratio (INR) values after initiating warfarin therapy due to an unusual combination of excessive thyroid hormones, amiodarone therapy, and a genetic abnormality affecting warfarin metabolism.
Genetic analysis revealed that the patient was CYP2C9*2 wild-type, CYP2C9*3/*3 homozygous mutant, and VKORC1*3/*3 homozygous mutant. A review of the literature revealed that both mutations can independently affect warfarin metabolism. In addition, amiodarone therapy and the presence of thyrotoxicosis per se can affect warfarin metabolism and reduce the dose needed to maintain INR in the therapeutic range. The association of the 2 genetic polymorphisms in a patient with AIT is extremely rare and strongly impairs warfarin metabolism, exposing the patient to a high risk of overtreatment.
In patients with AIT, warfarin therapy should be gradually introduced, starting with a very low dose, because of the significant risk of warfarin overtreatment. Whether the genetic analysis of CYP2C9 and VKORC1 polymorphisms should be routinely performed in AIT patients remains conjectural.

Abstract: Dronedarone was introduced in 2009 as a new antiarrhythmic agent and since then has been increasingly prescribed in atrial fibrillation or flutter. To date, two cases of severe toxic hepatitis have been reported in patients treated with dronedarone, both requiring emergency liver transplantation, and the FDA as well as the EMA have issued warnings about possible severe hepatotoxicity of dronedarone. Here we report an additional case of toxic hepatitis associated with dronedarone presenting with acute liver failure, followed by spontaneous recovery, in a 69-year old woman.

Abstract: A 58-year-old woman with chronic heart failure (CHF) received cardiac resynchronization-defibrillator (CRT-D) therapy without atrial lead implantation due to longstanding atrial fibrillation (AF). Three months after oral amiodarone therapy was initiated for the treatment of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia detected by the CRT-D device, the patient's heart failure symptoms worsened and 12-lead electrocardiography showed newly emerged p-waves with atrioventricular (AV) dissociation. Immediately after the device was upgraded to the DDD-biventricular pacemaker, the patient's heart failure symptoms and cardiac function dramatically improved, which suggests that AV dissociation has a much more negative impact on the cardiac function than AF in patients with CHF.

Abstract: In the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), the presence of baseline left bundle branch block or a permanent pacemaker rhythm poses a challenge.
We present a case report highlighting this challenge, along with a review of pertinent literature.
A 70-year-old female with known severe idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and moderate coronary artery disease who was status post-biventricular pacemaker/implantable cardioverter defibrillator insertion was brought to our institution via Emergency Medical Services with recurrent firing of her implantable cardioverter defibrillator and syncope. After stabilization in the Emergency Department and treatment with intravenous amiodarone, the patient admitted to having ongoing chest pains. The electrocardiogram revealed evidence of biventricular pacing with superimposed ST-segment elevations in the anterolateral leads indicative of myocardial injury. She underwent prompt angiography, thrombectomy, and bare-metal stent insertion to a totally occluded proximal left anterior descending coronary artery, with resolution of her chest pain and improvement in the ST-segment changes.
Despite proposed criteria that aid in the recognition of AMI with underlying left bundle branch block and paced rhythm; the advent of new pacing modalities and the potential variability of pacing sites impose additional diagnostic challenges requiring higher level of suspicion and better physician awareness.

Abstract: Ventricular arrhythmia-related sudden cardiac arrest in infants with structurally normal hearts is rare. There have been no previously published reports of infants <3 months of age with ventricular fibrillation in which a primary diagnosis could not be defined.
Retrospective chart review of 3 unrelated infants <2 months of age from 3 different tertiary care centers within the United States and Australia was conducted. All 3 infants survived sudden cardiac arrest secondary to multiple episodes of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation. Each infant demonstrated unique and transient ECG findings consisting of ST changes and QRS widening before arrhythmia onset, which have not been previously reported. Amiodarone, sedation, sodium channel-blocking agents, and ventricular pacing were effective in suppressing acute events. Despite thorough investigation, including genetic testing, the cause of ventricular arrhythmias in each of these infants remains unclear.
This is the first report of idiopathic ventricular fibrillation in young infants preceded by stereotypical transient ECG changes. These findings may represent a new, potentially treatable cause of sudden infant death. Recognition of these prodromal changes may be important in future management and survival of these infants.

Abstract: We describe a case of a healthy male full-term neonate, 21 days old, admitted to the emergency room, presenting a severe cardiovascular collapse with an initial sinus rhythm. The first diagnostic hypothesis was of septic shock, having antibiotics, fluid resuscitation, inotropic drugs and ventilatory support started immediately. After achieving haemodynamic stability, a new cardiovascular collapse occurred with supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). The latter was successfully treated and the neonate did not suffer any organ damage. Cardiogenic shock should be considered despite being a much rarer cause of shock in neonates. SVT is promptly diagnosed when a cardiorespiratory monitor is available; however, the intermittent occurrence of the tachycardia episodes makes this diagnosis more difficult to recognise and manage.

Abstract: We report electroversion in treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF) and atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia (AVNRT) in a patient with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and cervical spinal cord injury. At first, the patient sustained respiratory failure and weak cough reflex, thereafter repeated bronchoscopy was used to aspirate the sputum as well as control the pneumonia, which resulted in arrhythmia (AF and AVNRT). Two doses of intravenous amiodarone failed to correct the arrhythmia. After restoration of sinus rhythm by electroversion, he was successfully weaned from mechanical ventilation and discharged from the intensive care unit without recurrent arrhythmia.

Abstract: We present a case of severe acute kidney injury (AKI) occurring shortly after the initiation of dronedarone therapy, which we suspect was the result of an adverse drug reaction. The mechanism of AKI cannot be definitively determined. The most probable mechanism however involves dehydration secondary to diarrhoea, and medications causing hypotension, both precipitating AKI, further exacerbated by reduced excretion of medications reducing tissue perfusion. This case adds to the growing number of reports submitted to pharmacovigilance authorities regarding the association between dronedarone and AKI. It serves as a reminder of the risks of cardiovascular polypharmacy likely to be prevalent in patients considered for dronedarone (which causes diarrhoea as a common side-effect).

Abstract: The concept of chronotropic incompetence may have to be fine-tuned in an era of proven benefit of heart rate reducing therapy. It is illustrated in three patients with heart failure referred for heart transplantation evaluation. In patients one and two, symptoms of heart failure and exercise capacity improved by reducing the dose of the beta-blocking agent (case 1 and 2) and, in patient three, by additionally lowering the dose of amiodarone. Patient three showed reduced exercise tolerance, particularly during cycling albeit not during walking. Exercise tolerance during cycling improved after adaptation of the rate response parameters of his pacemaker. In conclusion, the three cases illustrate that chronotropic incompetence is a clinical reality, while a correct history taking and specific measures can solve the problem, reduce the complaints and even avoid more aggressive therapeutic options such as orthotopic transplantation.

Abstract: Hyponatremia secondary to the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) during amiodarone therapy is a rare but potentially lethal adverse effect. We report a case of severe hyponatremia associated with amiodarone, and discuss its clinical implications.
An 84-year-old Caucasian man with a past medical history of hypertension and diabetes was admitted to the hospital with a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction. He underwent coronary artery bypass graft and developed atrial fibrillation on postoperative day 2. A loading dose of amiodarone followed by a maintenance dose was started. The serum sodium level was 136 mmol/l at discharge and subsequently decreased to 105 mmol/l 11 days later, at which time the patient represented with altered mental status. The diagnosis of SIADH was made based on euvolemic hypoosmotic hyponatremia, lack of any other medication known to cause SIADH and urine that was less than maximally dilute. The serum sodium increased gradually to 123 mmol/l after 36 h of treatment with hypertonic saline, demeclocycline and fluid restriction.
SIADH-induced hyponatremia associated with amiodarone occurs rarely. Since severe hyponatremia is associated with significant neurological damage and mortality, clinicians should carefully monitor serum sodium during amiodarone therapy.

Abstract: A full-term male neonate presented with cyanosis upon delivery and was subsequently diagnosed with d-transposition of the great arteries, ventricular septal defect, and restrictive atrial septal defect. Following initiation of intravenous prostaglandins and balloon atrial septostomy, an arterial switch operation was performed on day 3 of life. The postoperative course was complicated by intractable ventricular tachycardia that was refractory to lidocaine, amiodarone, esmolol, fosphenytoin, and mexiletine drug therapy. Ventricular tachycardia was suppressed with overdrive atrial pacing but recurred upon discontinuation. Seven weeks postoperatively, radiofrequency catheter ablation was performed due to hemodynamically compromising persistent ventricular tachycardia refractory to medical therapy. The ventricular tachycardia was localized to the inferior-lateral right ventricular outlet septum. The procedure was successful without complications or recurrence. Antiarrhythmics were discontinued after the ablation procedure. Seven days after the ablation, a different, slower fascicular rhythm was noted to compete with the infant's sinus rhythm. This was consistent with the preablation amiodarone having reached subtherapeutic levels given its very long half-life. The patient was restarted on oral beta blockers and amiodarone. The patient was subsequently discharged home in predominantly sinus rhythm with intermittent fascicular rhythm.

Abstract: The wearable cardioverter-defibrillator (WCD) is indicated in patients who are considered to be at temporarily high risk for sudden cardiac death (SCD), when an implantable defibrillator is not yet clearly indicated. We report the case of a 41-year-old patient with a newly diagnosed severely reduced left ventricular (LV) function for suspected myocarditis and repeated nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (VT). This patient was supplied with a WCD who came back to the hospital 4 weeks after discharge with an electrical storm and adequate discharge of the WCD. After application of amiodarone, no further arrhythmias were detected during intrahospital course. For further risk stratification, we performed a magnetic field imaging (MFI), that was reported to be useful in risk assessment of SCD in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy. This measurement showed a normal result, but we decided to give an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) to the patient. During a follow-up of 1 year, no further arrhythmias occurred. With this case, we report the efficacy of a WCD, which is a novel tool in patients at temporarily high risk of SCD and we report a novel method of risk stratification in patients with a high risk of SCD.

Abstract: This was an interesting, yet enigmatic, case. An elderly male with a prolonged QT interval developed a third-degree block with a slow ventricular rate. This spontaneously converted to a polymorphic v tach (probably torsades) that worsened his cardiac output causing pulmonary congestion and hypoxia. He ultimately converted back to a third-degree block following treatment with amiodarone and magnesium sulfate. More importantly, paramedics recognized the complexity of the case and, because of the very short transport time, elected to rapidly transport the patient. Complex cases such as this do not fit into any standardized EMS protocol. Because of this, we need paramedics who see and recognize serious conditions that don't fall within the constraints of algorithmic protocols. In this case, they identified the problem, transported promptly and alerted the staffin a busy ED of the patient's complex and deteriorating condition.

Abstract: Amiodarone pulmonary toxicity (APT) is the most serious side effect of amiodarone. Although severe APT, such as ARDS, is rare, mortality of severe APT is high. Polymyxin B-immobilized fiber column direct hemoperfusion (PMX-DHP) is a medical device that reduces blood endotoxin levels in sepsis. Recent reports have shown that PMX-DHP improves oxygenation in patients with acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and drug-induced severe interstitial pneumonia. Here, we present a case study of a patient with severe APT treated with PMX-DHP with complete recovery. The patient rapidly developed respiratory failure and required mechanical ventilation. Despite corticosteroid pulse therapy, no clinical improvement was noted. PMX-DHP was then started, and severe respiratory failure improved with reduction of serum levels of amiodarone and its metabolite monodesethylamiodarone. The patient was weaned from mechanical ventilation and has done well without recurrence. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of PMX-DHP therapy for severe APT. We speculate that PMX-DHP could be a new treatment strategy for severe APT.

Abstract: Oral direct thrombin inhibitors have improved treatment of non-valvular atrial fibrillation. Safety concerns have been raised since there is no antidote for treatment of secondary haemorrhages and the absence of widely validated test to monitor drug levels. We present a case of dabigatran overdose in an 82-year-old female who was treated with a seemingly appropriate dose.

Abstract: Junctional ectopic tachycardia (JET) after cardiopulmonary bypass surgery for congenital heart defects is often therapy-resistant and associated with high morbidity and mortality. Improvement of pharmacological therapy is needed.
We retrospectively analysed the clinical data of four patients with congenital heart defects, who developed post-operative JET and were treated with landiolol hydrochloride, representing all such patients treated at our university. In two patients, landiolol was used after failure of response to anti-arrhythmic therapies, including thermal control, sedation, discontinuation of catecholamines, and pharmacological therapy with nifekalant and amiodarone. Landiolol was used as a first-line therapy in the other two patients. In all patients, landiolol, at a dose ranging from 1.0 to 10.0 µg/kg/min, achieved successful sinus conversion within 15 min. No adverse events, such as bradycardia, hypotension, or hypoglycaemia, were encountered in all four patients.
Although limited to a small and heterogeneous group of patients, the results suggest that landiolol is a potentially useful therapeutic option for the well-known difficult condition of post-operative JET, and warrant further investigation in large-scale controlled studies.

Abstract: The HeartMate II is a continuous-flow left ventricular assist device that can be explanted from patients after cardiac recovery. We implanted a HeartMate II in a 21-year-old man who had idiopathic cardiomyopathy. A year later, he developed thyrotoxicosis, presumably secondary to amiodarone administered for ventricular fibrillation. Four months after the diagnosis of thyrotoxicosis, thyroid hormone levels had returned to normal, and native cardiac function had improved remarkably. After a support period of 24 months, the HeartMate II was explanted. Six years later, the patient continues to be in New York Heart Association functional Class I. Amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis may have contributed to myocardial recovery.

Abstract: Amiodarone is a widely used and very potent antiarrhythmic substance. Among its adverse effects, pulmonary toxicity is the most dangerous without a causal treatment option. Due to a very long half-life, accumulation can only be prevented by strict adherence to certain dosage patterns. In this review, we outline different safe and proven dosing schemes of amiodarone and compare the incidence and description of pulmonary toxicity. Reason for this is a case of fatal pulmonary toxicity due to a subacute iatrogenic overdosing of amiodarone in a 74-year-old male patient with known severe coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure and ectopic atrial tachycardia with reduced function of kidneys and liver but without preexisting lung disease. Within 30 days, the patient received 32.2 g of amiodarone instead of 15.6 g as planned. Despite early corticosteroid treatment after fast exclusion of all other differential diagnoses, the patient died another month later in our intensive care unit from respiratory failure due to bipulmonal pneumonitis.

Abstract: A 27-year-old woman with a history of depression and previous overdose presented within 60 min of ingestion of 50 g of caffeine powder. Initially alert but hypotensive and tachycardic, the patient developed a broad complex tachycardia followed by a seizure and multiple ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrests. Following multiple defibrillations for VF, eight cycles of cardiopulmonary resuscitation and treatment with amiodarone, lidocaine, magnesium and potassium supplementation, the patient went to the intensive care unit (ICU). While there, the patient had further VF and required haemofiltration for a profound metabolic acidaemia with cardiac rhythm instability. She developed a postcardiac arrest systemic inflammatory response syndrome with episodes of acute pulmonary oedema, profound vasoplegia, hypothermia and coagulopathy. After 5 days in the ICU, the patient was stable enough to be transferred to the ward, with a persistent sinus tachycardia, and was discharged 3 days later with cardiology and psychiatry follow-up.

Abstract: A 61 year old patient with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy and implantable cardioverter defibrillator presented with multiple shocks for ventricular tachycardia (VT). EKG revealed monomorphic sustained VT which was left bundle inferior axis that spontaneously changed into sustained VT which was right bundle superior axis. This was suggestive of an outflow tract VT transforming into a VT probably related to reentry from LV scar. The patient was transferred to our university for VT ablation. However, further investigation revealed amiodarone induced hyperthyroidism which was the cause of his ventricular tachycardia storm. Reversible causes of VT should be considered before proceeding with radiofrequency ablation.

Abstract: We report the case of an adult male patient who was admitted to our hospital with a diagnosis of vivax malaria complicated with renal insufficiency and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient was treated with intravenous artesunate. He was intubated and mechanically ventilated and taken up for haemodialysis in view of worsening renal parameters. He developed tachycardia a few hours later. ECG showed sinus tachycardia. Tachycardia persisted though the blood pressure was normal, there was no evidence of bleeding, and the heart was clinically normal. We tried to control the heart rate with diltiazem, adenosine and metoprolol but the tachycardia persisted. The heart rate was finally controlled with amiodarone. The patient improved, was weaned off from the ventilator and extubated. His renal functions gradually improved. Oral amiodarone was continued and there was no recurrence of tachycardia. We present this case to highlight the interesting association of vivax malaria with persistent, difficult to treat tachycardia.

Abstract: A 73-year-old gentleman presented to the hospital after an episode of loss of consciousness. He had a defibrillator in situ, which on interrogation was found to have fired for an episode of ventricular fibrillation. As an inpatient he developed frequent episodes of self-terminating ventricular tachycardia, treated initially with oral amiodarone. A 24 h amiodarone infusion was started on day 3 of admission, following which the patient developed hyperventilation. Investigations revealed that this was secondary to acute hepatic and renal failure, requiring haemofiltration on the intensive care unit. Cessation of amiodarone was associated with normalisation of liver function over 48 h. The patient had normal blood and jugular venous pressures throughout days 1-4 of admission. We discuss the role of amiodarone as the predominant factor in the deterioration of this patient's liver function, versus the differential diagnosis of ischaemia-induced hepatotoxicity, citing recent research regarding this subject.

Abstract: Takotsubo syndrome (TTS)/cardiomyopathy is a syndrome that mimics acute myocardial infarction in the absence of coronary artery disease and is characterized by acute onset of chest pain, electrocardiographic abnormalities, and reversible left ventricular dysfunction. It is usually induced by emotional and physical stress. Fluorouracil is one of the most frequently used chemotherapy agents and a relatively common adverse reaction of fluorouracil is cardiotoxicity. Herein we describe a patient without a history of cardiovascular disorder who developed severe heart failure during infusion of fluorouracil for metastatic gastric cancer. Remarkably, the patient did not develop TTS during prior chemotherapy regimen, which also included fluorouracil. The patient's findings were consistent with the proposed TTS diagnostic criteria and coronary angiography was normal, without obstructive coronary artery disease. With supportive care, the patient's cardiac functions returned to normal. TTS is not a well known syndrome to clinicians and this condition appears to occur more frequently than previously thought. In addition to the presented case, a review of the clinical features and outcome of 10 reported cases of fluorouracil-induced TTS is presented.

Abstract: A known complication of Amiodarone therapy is Amiodarone induced Pulmonary Toxicity (APT). Several features of this adverse effect make it difficult to diagnosis and treat. The case of a 63-year-old male with classic radiographic and histologic findings of APT is discussed. Clinical presentation, pathophysiology, diagnostic findings, and treatment strategies are reviewed. The patient was successfully managed with pulse high dose steroid therapy.

Abstract: Acute amiodarone toxicity after a single dose of intravenous amiodarone is very rarely seen. We report the case of a 64-year-old Chinese man who presented with atrial fibrillation and fluid overload due to congestive cardiac failure. He was treated with a single bolus dose of intravenous amiodarone, after which he developed elevated serum transaminases, coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia and acute renal failure. His parameters returned to normal after 25 days and his recovery was uneventful.

Abstract: New-onset atrial fibrillation in patients hospitalized for an acute myocardial infarction often leads to hemodynamic deterioration and has serious adverse prognostic implications; mortality is particularly high in patients with congestive heart failure and/or a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. The mechanism of atrial fibrillation in the context of an acute myocardial infarction has not been well characterized and an effective treatment other than optimal medical therapy and mechanical hemodynamic support are expected.
A 71 year-old male with an acute myocardial infarction due to an occlusion of the left main coronary artery was treated with percutaneous coronary intervention. He had developed severe congestive heart failure with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 34%. The systemic circulation was maintained with an intraaortic balloon pump, continuous hemodiafiltration, and mechanical ventilation until atrial fibrillation occurred on day 3 which immediately led to cardiogenic shock. Because atrial fibrillation was refractory to intravenous amiodarone, beta-blockers, and a total of 15 electrical cardioversions, the patient underwent emergent radiofrequency catheter ablation on day 4. Soon after electrical cardioversion, ectopies from the right superior pulmonary vein triggered the initiation of atrial fibrillation. The right pulmonary veins were isolated during atrial fibrillation. Again, atrial fibrillation was electrically cardioverted, then, sinus rhythm was restored. Subsequently, the left pulmonary veins were isolated. The stabilization of the hemodynamics was successfully achieved with an increase in the blood pressure and urine volume. Hemodiafiltration and amiodarone were discontinued. The patient had been free from atrial fibrillation recurrence until he suddenly died due to ventricular fibrillation on day 9.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of pulmonary vein isolation for a rescue purpose applied in a patient with hemodymically unstable atrial fibrillation complicated with an acute myocardial infarction. This case demonstrates that ectopic activity in the pulmonary veins may be responsible for triggering atrial fibrillation in the critical setting of an acute myocardial infarction and thus pulmonary vein isolation could be an effective therapeutic option.

Abstract: Systemic lupus can involve any part of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Diarrhea generally results from complications arising from infection, drugs or pancreatitis. We herein report the case of a 40-year-old hypertensive man with a psychotic disorder in whom the evaluation of chronic diarrhea revealed a diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis and protein-losing enteropathy that required treatment with both steroids and mycophenolate mofetil. Over the following year, the patient developed atrial fibrillation, miliary tuberculosis and generalized clonic tonic seizures. He is currently under regular follow-up care and receives antiepileptics, antihypertensives, diltiazem, amiodarone and warfarin.

Abstract: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) occurs in 1 in every 500 individuals. It represents the most common cause of sudden cardiac death in those under the age of twenty-five. 3-5% patients with HCM go on to develop the dilated, hypokinetic end stage (ES) HCM with systolic failure. They have a higher incidence of heart failure, sudden deaths and defibrillator shocks. To the best of our knowledge this is first report of successful use of dronedarone for suppression of VT associated with ES HCM.

Abstract: A 10-year-old girl presented to the emergency department of a regional hospital with 1 episode of generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Postictal monitoring followed by a 12-lead electrocardiogram showed fast atrial fibrillation with intermittent wide QRS regular tachycardia. Immediately following this, her rhythm changed to wide QRS irregular tachycardia without hemodynamic compromise. She was suspected to have ventricular tachycardia and was treated with intravenous amiodarone with cardioversion to sinus rhythm. Subsequent electrocardiogram in sinus rhythm showed typical features of manifest Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) accessory pathway. This case illustrates the diagnostic and therapeutic dilemmas in patients with atrial fibrillation, wide QRS tachycardia, and undiagnosed WPW syndrome with antidromic conduction of atrial arrhythmias through the accessory pathway. Furthermore, this case demonstrates that undiagnosed wide QRS tachycardias need to be treated with drugs acting on the accessory pathway, thus keeping in mind underlying WPW syndrome as a possibility to avoid potentially catastrophic events.

Abstract: A former 34-week-old female infant with Down syndrome underwent surgical correction of a congenital heart defect at 5 months of age. Her postoperative course was complicated by severe pulmonary hypertension and junctional ectopic tachycardia. Following treatment with amiodarone infusion, she developed laboratory indices of acute liver injury. At their peak, liver transaminase levels were 19 to 35 times greater than the upper limit of normal. Transaminitis was accompanied by coagulopathy, hyperammonemia, and high serum lactate and lipid levels. Hepatic laboratory abnormalities began to resolve within 48 hr of stopping amiodarone infusion. Heart rate control was achieved concurrently with discovery of laboratory test result abnormalities, and no further antiarrhythmic therapy was required. The intravenous formulation of amiodarone contains the diluent polysorbate 80, which may have hepatotoxic effects. Specifically, animal studies suggest that polysorbate 80 may destabilize cell membranes and predispose to fatty change within liver architecture. Polysorbate was implicated in infant fatalities from E-ferol use in the 1980s. This case illustrates a possible adverse event by the Naranjo probability scale. Given the extent of clinically apparent hepatic injury, this patient was not rechallenged with amiodarone during the remainder of her hospitalization. With amiodarone now used as first-line pharmacologic therapy for critical tachyarrhythmia in this population, the number of children exposed to this drug should be expected to increase. Laboratory indices of liver function should be evaluated at initiation of amiodarone therapy, as well as frequently throughout duration of therapy. Consideration should be given to polysorbate-free formulation of intravenous amiodarone for use in the cohort with congenital cardiac disease.

Abstract: Bidirectional ventricular tachycardia (BVT) is an uncommon type of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (PVT) with alternating polarity of the QRS complex most commonly described digitalis toxicity. Recent data has demonstrated the possible molecular basis of this electrocardiographic phenomenon. To our knowledge this is the first reported case of BVT in a patient with orthotopic cardiac transplantation and coronary allograft vasculopathy.

Abstract: Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome is associated with heart failure (HF) mainly via tachycardia. Several case report series have suggested dyssynchrony due to an accessory pathway as a possible cause of HF even in the absence of tachyarrhythmias. The role of cardiac resynchronization in the suppression of anterograde conduction of accessory pathways by catheter ablation or pharmacotherapy in such patients remains unclear, especially in the pediatric population. We describe an infant case with HF due to ventricular dyssynchrony and refractory tachycardia caused by a right anterolateral accessory pathway. Cardiac resynchronization either by catheter ablation or amiodarone appears to be of value in such cases.

Abstract: A 71-year-old white male presented to the emergency department complaining of a worsening lower extremity rash. Thirteen days before presentation, the patient was placed on Multaq (dronedarone) for his paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Biopsy-proven leukocytoclastic vasculitis (LV) was diagnosed, and causes for the condition other than drug-induced were investigated and ruled out. Rash has been cited as a possible side effect of Multaq; however, a literature search has revealed this to be the first documented case of likely multaq-induced LV. Other patients on Multaq therapy should be monitored for signs and symptoms of LV and be referred to an acute care setting as indicated.

Abstract: Tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy (TIC) is an important cause of heart failure as it is potentially reversible after ventricular rate control. A 66-year-old hypertensive woman presented with a 15-day history of tachycardia, dyspnoea and oedema. ECG revealed atrial fibrillation with ventricular frequency of 130 beats per minute (bpm). Echocardiogram showed dilated left ventricle (LV) with 0.39 ejection fraction. Angiography revealed non-obstructed coronary arteries. Heart rate and cardiac failure were controlled with amiodarone, digoxine, captopril, metoprolol and furosemide. During follow-up, despite drug dose optimisation, the patient kept complaining of tachycardia and dyspnoea with a ventricular rate between 108 and 120&emsp14;bpm. Medical staff suspected she was not taking her medicines properly. Two months later, the patient was asymptomatic and had converted to sinus rhythm (heart rate of 76&emsp14;bpm). Echocardiogram showed normal LV size and function. Patient's diagnosis was TIC. Although rare, TIC should be considered in all cases of systolic dysfunction associated with tachyarrhythmia.

Abstract: Subclinical pericardial effusions are common in patients with untreated hypothyroidism and usually resolve with thyroid replacement therapy, but cardiac tamponade is a rare presentation of prolonged untreated hypothyroidism. We report the first case of cardiac tamponade due to hypothyroidism produced by administration of amiodarone.

Abstract: Transcatheter closure of ventricular septal defect (VSD) has been widely used worldwide. Despite high success rate and minimal operative mortality, arrhythmia during and post-operation has been frequently observed. However, sustained ventricular tachycardia following deployment of occluder has not been reported. In this present case, we present one rare case of late-onset sustained ventricular tachycardia, which developed 71 hr after deployment of an Amplatzer-type occluder for perimembranous VSD (PmVSD) in a 3-year and 5-month-old boy. The sustained ventricular tachycardia was successfully corrected with the administration of lidocaine, amiodarone, and dexamethasone. The reoccurrence of ventricular tachycardia was not observed in the most recent follow-up at 6 month. In summary, the current case indicated that sustained ventricular tachycardia could occur following deployment of Amplatzer-type occluder for PmVSD, which could be corrected with antiarrhythmic drugs.

Abstract: Postoperative junctional ectopic tachycardia (JET) in children undergoing cardiac surgery is a serious arrhythmia that is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. We present here a case of successful landiolol therapy for postoperative JET in a 3-month-old infant who underwent ventricular septal defect closure and right pulmonary artery plasty. His left ventricular function was poor postoperatively. The JET was refractory to amiodarone and caused severe hypotension, which was required cardiac massage. Continuous intravenous infusion of low-dose landiolol reduced the persistent JET rate immediately, and restored to sinus rhythm with stable hemodynamics.

Abstract: A 3-year-old man with an implanted cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) for type 2 Brugada syndrome was admitted to coronary care unit with ventricular fibrillation electrical storm and consequent appropriate recurrent ICD shocks. The rhythm did not settle with conventional antiarrhythmics such as β-blockers and amiodarone. An isoprenaline infusion was set up with immediate stabilisation of rhythm. After a period of monitoring, the infusion was stopped and oral quinidine was started. He has remained free of problems for 1 year. This case-report summarises these novel treatments for electrical storm in Brugada syndrome and the mechanism behind them.

Abstract:  We report the first use of a new platform, the Guiraudon Universal Cardiac Introducer (GUCI), in humans for accessing the left atrium for catheter-based ablations in patients with resistant atrial arrhythmias after total cavopulmonary derivation. The GUCI was originally designed for intracardiac access for closed, beating instrumental intracardiac surgery.The patient was a 29-year-old man with problematic atrial arrhythmias resistant to antiarrhythmic drugs because of severe uncontrolled bradycardia and because his pacemaker was explanted for infection.The GUCI was attached to the left atrial appendage via an anterior left thoracotomy. The GUCI was modified to accommodate introduction and manipulation of multiple catheters. This allowed electrophysiologists to perform catheter-based exploration and ablation. A DDD pacemaker was implanted, with an atrial endocardial lead introduced via the GUCI cuff and a ventricular epicardial lead.Postoperative atrial arrhythmias were controlled using amiodarone and atrial pacing. At the 12-month follow-up, the patient was arrhythmia- and drug-free and returned to full employment.This new access offers an additional new alternative atrial access to treat resistant arrhythmia after total cavopulmonary derivation. The current state-of-the-art makes patient selection difficult and uncomfortable for the surgeons because of incomplete preoperative electrophysiological data, such as a return to the beginning of surgery for arrhythmia; however, more cumulative experience with intraoperative electrophysiological data and new mapping technologies should address these limitations.

Abstract: In this report, the clinical characteristics of a 65-year-old female patient with tricuspid regurgitation, ischemic cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure, and chronic renal failure were retrospectively evaluated. Laboratory studies revealed cardiogenic ascites coincided with nephrogenic ascites and subclinical amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism. The ascites of the patient was responsive to management of congestive heart failure and therapeutic paracentesis during the first episode, add-on therapy with intensified hemodialysis during the second episode, and add-on therapy with low-dose eltroxin during the third episode. When nephrogenic ascites and cardiogenic ascites of maintenance hemodialysis patients become refractory, hypothyroidism should be examined in these patients.

Abstract: To describe a case in which hemodialysis was performed before cardiac transplantation in an attempt to reverse the effects of dabigatran and reduce the risk of bleeding associated with surgery.
A 59-year-old female with heart failure and atrial fibrillation was admitted for orthotropic heart transplant. She had been stable at home with continuous milrinone therapy 0.25 μg/kg/min, amiodarone 200 mg twice daily, and dabigatran 150 mg twice daily for stroke prevention secondary to atrial fibrillation. Upon notification of organ availability, the patient was admitted to the hospital for transplant surgery, with her last dose of dabigatran taken approximately 36 hours before admission. Coagulation studies indicated normal activated partial thromboplastin time, slightly elevated international normalized ratio of 1.2, and elevated thrombin time (TT) of 90.6 seconds (upper limit of normal 19.9 seconds). A hemodialysis catheter was emergently placed and dialysis was initiated. One hour after initiation, TT decreased to 65.5 seconds. After 2.5 hours of dialysis, TT further decreased to 60.2 seconds; at that time, the patient underwent transplantation with no abnormal bleeding during or following surgery.
Minimal data exist on techniques to reverse the effects of dabigatran in cases of bleeding or emergent surgery. This case examines the efficacy of hemodialysis to decrease dabigatran's effect on clotting assays prior to surgery to reduce the risk of bleeding. In this case, a TT of 60.2 seconds with recent dabigatran administration did not result in abnormal bleeding associated with cardiac surgery.
To our knowledge, this case report represents the first published data on the effects of hemodialysis on dabigatran removal and reversal of anticoagulation associated with dabigatran before surgery. The routine use of preoperative hemodialysis in patients on dabigatran is not recommended; however, the potential efficacy in such circumstances is supported by the successful results in this case.

Abstract: Epsilon wave, which is a major diagnosis criterion for arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy/dysplasia (ARVD/C), is defined as small amplitude potentials. The present case is a 49-year-old man with a history of syncope and palpitations for 6 months. The ECG documented ventricular tachycardia (VT) when the patient has palpitations. However, there has been a giant epsilon wave in sinus rhythm. Electroanatomic mapping also has a prominent double potential identified on ABL catheter. The amplitude of epsilon wave reached 0.9 mV, which might be the maximum epsilon wave until now.

Abstract: Neonatal enterovirus myocarditis is a rare but serious infection that is often an underrecognized cause of cardiovascular collapse. Enterovirus myocarditis in patients with such collapse should be suspected when signs of congestive heart failure and tachyarrhythmia are present. The majority of reported electrical disturbances associated with enterovirus myocarditis are ventricular in origin, but the infection can present as atrial tachyarrhythmia. Atrial tachyarrhythmias associated with enterovirus myocarditis are difficult to manage because of their resistance to conventional antiarrhythmic therapy. We present 2 cases of neonates with atrial tachycardia associated with enterovirus myocarditis who responded to a combination of amiodarone and flecainide.

Abstract: An obese 65-year-old male smoker with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease developed an iatrogenic pneumothorax with pulmonary haemorrhage during an elective transthoracic needle biopsy of a pulmonary lesion. Successful re-inflation was achieved with a chest drain which was then removed before transfer to the medical ward. He later developed persistent atrial fibrillation with breathlessness and haemoptysis. He was treated empirically for a pulmonary embolus, which was subsequently ruled out with CT pulmonary angiogram. Serial chest radiographs demonstrated recurrence of his pneumothorax and a chest drain was re-inserted. His atrial fibrillation was erroneously managed as supraventricular tachycardia, which was resistant to vagal manoeuvres and adenosine but later responded to intravenous amiodarone before a further relapse. Upon successful management of the pneumothorax, his atrial fibrillation terminated. This case highlighted the persistent and serious nature of complications posttransthoracic needle biopsy.

Abstract: This report describes the case of a 6-month-old girl with a large cardiac fibroma in the right ventricle. Ventricular tachycardia associated with the fibroma was successfully treated with amiodarone. At the age of 3 years, surgical resection was indicated because of right ventricular outflow tract obstruction caused by progression of the tumor. The fibroma was successfully resected, and further follow-up evaluation was uneventful.

Abstract: Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) is widely accepted as a treatment for air or gas embolism, carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning, clostridial myonecrosis, crush injuries, and thermal burns. To the best of our knowledge, after HBO therapy, atrial fibrillation (AF) has not been reported in the literature yet. We herein describe a case of AF that occurred in a woman who had taken HBO therapy for CO poisoning. The 78-year-old female patient was admitted to the emergency department with less of consciousness. Carboxyhemoglobin value at arterial blood gases was found to be 42.6% and was thought to be CO poisoning. Electrocardiography (ECG) was normal sinus rhythm. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy was planned. After the HBO therapy, ECG showed AF. Her rhythm returned to the normal sinus rhythm after amiodarone treatment. Physicians should keep in mind that HBO treatment could contribute to AF, and all patients' ECG should be monitored before and after HBO therapy.

Abstract: A previously fit and well 40-year-old man presented to the emergency department with palpitations after suffering an 11 000 volt electrical shock from overhead power cables through a mobile crane which he was operating. His ECG demonstrated the presence of new atrial fibrillation at a rate of 80 beats per min. He was haemodynamically stable, and had otherwise only sustained a small exit burn to his left great toe. Routine blood tests including creatine kinase and troponin T were normal. A bolus of intravenous flecainide failed to restore sinus rhythm, but an amiodarone infusion was successful. An electrical shock is a rare cause of atrial fibrillation. There is no consensus over optimal medical management. Numerous treatment plans have been previously employed with varying degrees of success.

Abstract: Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is an inherited condition associated with ventricular tachycardia (VT) triggered by exercise or sympathetic stress. Incessant VT may develop due to defibrillator-induced storming-a condition where implantable cardioverter-defibrillator discharges result in a hyperadrenergic state, provoking further VT and defibrillator discharge. We describe the case of a 14-year-old boy with CPVT caused by a calsequestrin-2 mutation, who presented with defibrillator-induced storming refractory to β-blockers, calcium-channel blockers, amiodarone, and dronedarone. Flecainide and β-blocker use suppressed incessant VT and defibrillator-induced storming.

Abstract: Postmortem distribution concentrations of the pain medication tapentadol and its metabolite N-desmethyltapentadol are reported. Tapentadol (Nucynta®) is a synthetic mu-opioid receptor agonist that also has norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor action. The laboratory received two cases. Case 1: a 19-year-old, morbidly obese male with sudden unexpected death. Toxicology results revealed tapentadol (femoral blood: 0.77 mg/L, liver: 1.65 mg/kg), N-desmethyltapentadol (femoral blood: 0.07 mg/L, liver: 0.19 mg/kg), diazepam (femoral blood: 0.04 mg/L), nordiazepam (femoral blood: 0.06 mg/L) and amiodarone (femoral blood: 5.30 mg/L). Case 2: a 60-year-old female who died from complications following hip replacement. Only tapentadol (femoral blood: 0.26 mg/L, liver: 0.52 mg/kg) was found in the toxicology results. Quantitative results of tapentadol/N-desmethyltapentadol were achieved using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in multiple reactions monitoring mode. This is the first known distribution study of tapentadol and N-desmethyltapentadol values in postmortem cases.

Abstract: We report a congenital giant cardiac tumor that occupied the majority of left ventricular cavity with severe left ventricular inflow and outflow obstruction. The hemodynamics were similar to univentricular physiology. He was treated with prostaglandins and bilateral pulmonary artery banding. He had frequent supraventricular tachycardia associated with ventricular pre-excitation that was controlled by long-term administration of intravenous amiodarone. The patient died due to sepsis after 3 months.

Abstract: We report a case of torsade de pointes after intravenous amiodarone and concurrent hypokalemia. Despite treatment cessation and correction of electrolyte abnormalities, excessive QTc prolongation was noted, which persisted for 14 days. This prolonged course for QTc normalization may be attributed to the high rate of amiodarone loading and concurrent electrolyte disturbances coupled with possible underlying individual variability in pharmacokinetics.

Abstract: Factor V inhibitor is in itself a rare entity. We are reporting a case of an elderly male who presented with symptoms of bleeding and was later found to have developed factor V inhibitors. He had been on amiodarone for atrial fibrillation and developed hemorrhagic manifestations due to factor V inhibitors within a few months of initiating amiodarone therapy. Most of the cases of factor V inhibitors reported in the literature were found to be associated with exposure to bovine coagulation factors. However, in our case there was no evidence of bovine thrombin use during surgery. Furthermore, bovine thrombin-associated factor V inhibitors commonly emerge within 1-2 weeks after exposure during surgery versus several months later in our patient. There was dramatic improvement in the coagulation profile 6 weeks after discontinuation of amiodarone and institution of steroids and cyclophosphamide. We propose the consideration of amiodarone as a contributing agent in inhibitor generation even though a spontaneous development of factor V inhibitor could not be ruled out.

Abstract: A 58-year-old woman presented with severe left ventricular dysfunction and malignant arrhythmias after taking combination drug treatment for weight loss. The combination treatment included sibutramine, liothyronine, hydrochlorothiazide diuretic, metformin and fucus. The effect of these drugs individually and in combination is discussed, with particular reference to it being a malignant combination. The patient showed reversability of the left ventricular dysfunction and negative ventricular stimulation studies after cessation of the drug concoction.

Abstract: An 88-year-old female, living independently in the community, developed duodenal and gastric ulcers from using overthe-counter naproxen sodium for pain related to a shoulder fracture and arthritis of the knees. She was hospitalized and received packed red blood cells and intravenous proton pump inhibitor therapy. During her hospitalization, she developed atrial fibrillation (AF). Warfarin was not prescribed for stroke prevention because of the gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. The patient was initially placed on atenolol, and then amiodarone was added. After a two-week hospital stay she was discharged to a nursing facility to gain strength, further correct her anemia, and receive physical therapy for the shoulder and ambulation problems from arthritis of the knees. The amiodarone was continued in the nursing facility. After 15 days of amiodarone therapy (hospital and nursing facility), a laboratory report indicated an elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone level. Levothyroxine was prescribed. The patient was eventually discharged to an assisted living facility once her strength returned and her ambulation improved. GI bleeding with anemia and weakness from nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use and changes in thyroid function with amiodarone therapy for AF will be discussed.

Abstract: Warfarin is considered a high-risk drug because of its narrow therapeutic window, variability in dose response, and multitude of drug and food interactions. Although travel advice is available for patients who are taking warfarin, it is geared toward patients who are traveling to developed countries and tends to be lacking in detail. We describe a 53-year-old woman with two mechanical heart valves and chronic atrial fibrillation who was taking warfarin for thromboembolism prophylaxis and had plans to travel to Vietnam for 10 weeks. Three days before her departure, she was prescribed amiodarone for long-term use. As a result of the extended duration of her travel and the complexities of warfarin use, the pharmacists who managed the patient's anticoagulation reviewed several aspects of a comprehensive management approach with the patient for a safe international trip. They assessed the patient's thromboembolic and hemorrhagic risks, and determined which other drugs (e.g., enoxaparin, phytonadione), dosages, and adequate supplies would be required along with warfarin, as well as how to safely transport these drugs during travel. In addition, the logistics of effectively monitoring international normalized ratio (INR) levels were evaluated, and methods of managing multiple potential scenarios were carefully planned out. Contact with the patient was made through pharmacist-directed telephone visits throughout the travel period. A total of 12 telephone visits were conducted with the patient during the 10 weeks of travel. Her INR was supratherapeutic on three occasions and was subtherapeutic once; however, neither enoxaparin nor phytonadione were needed during the travel period, and the patient returned safely to the United States. Effective and safe use of high-risk drugs for patients leaving the United States requires extensive pretravel planning, and pharmacists can play a central role in optimizing therapeutic outcomes for these patients during international travel.

Abstract: Electrical storm is a challenging diagnosis for the clinician and requires detailed evaluation of the patient. Amiodarone is frequently used for the cessation of ventricular tachycardia attacks. Within antiarrhythmic effects of amiodarone, there are some harmful effects of the recent drug. Thyroid gland toxicity is one of the most important adverse effects of amiodarone and is called amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis. Thyrotoxicosis may alter arrhythmia and lead to frequent ventricular tachycardia attacks. Herein, we report a case of electrical storm caused by amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis.

Abstract: We report the case of a 67-year-old female with a wide QRS complex tachycardia at 180 bpm. A diagnosis of class IC atrial flutter with aberrant ventricular conduction caused by flecainide therapy was formulated. Intravenous adenosine administration resulted in adequate slowing of the ventricular rate and normalization of QRS complexes. Restoration of sinus rhythm was achieved with intravenous amiodarone. The response to adenosine confirmed the diagnosis of supraventricular tachycardia with aberrant conduction, but the transition from arrhythmia onset to restoration of sinus rhythm showed interesting peculiarities.

Abstract: A 23-year-old male presented with severe rest dyspnoea, engorged jugular veins, ankle oedema and heart rate 140 bpm. Computed tomography (CT) scan showed a large mediastinal mass with pericardial and atrial infiltration, pulmonary artery and superior vena cava compression. HIV infection was detected. Echocardiography showed 5 × 4 cm masses both in the right and the left atria, pericardial effusion, thickening of the right and left ventricular walls and hypokinesis; after intravenous contrast medium (SonoVue), the ventricular myocardium showed an increased, granular echogenicity, as did the mediastinal mass and pericardium. Nadroparin, bisoprolol, amiodarone and (suspecting non-Hodgkin lymphoma) steroids were started. After 3 days, at echocardiogram, the thickness of the ventricular walls was reduced and ejection fraction was improved. Mediastinal biopsy disclosed a large B-cell lymphoma. After starting systemic chemotherapy (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin) and highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), 11 days after admission the patient was in New York Heart Association (NYHA) class 1-2, with normal jugular veins and no oedema. The echocardiogram showed no more pericardial effusion, atrial masses reduced by 50%, normal interventricular septum thickness and ejection fraction. In August 2010, after six cycles of chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy, the patient was in complete remission. This case shows both the echocardiographic findings typical of neoplastic infiltration of the myocardium and the rapid improvement observed within a few days after chemotherapy. In the HAART era patients with HIV-related lymphoma and even massive involvement of the heart may receive aggressive treatment with curative intent. Echocardiography is useful in early assessment of the response to therapy.

Abstract: Amiodarone is effective for treating ventricular and supraventricular tachyarrhythmias, despite potential side effects which can include injury to the liver, thyroid, cornea, skin, and neuromuscular system. Acute lung toxicity is a known but rare side effect of amiodarone use, most commonly taking the form of an acute or subacute interstitial pneumonitis. Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage is a rare reaction, with few case reports documented in the literature since amiodarone became widely used in the early 1980s. We report the case of a patient who developed severe respiratory failure and diffuse alveolar infiltrates within 72 hours of initiating amiodarone therapy. Postmortem lung histology confirmed the diagnosis of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. The case presentation and proposed mechanisms of action will be reviewed here.

Abstract: A 58-year-old male diabetic patient with severe left ventricular dysfunction and pulmonary arterial hypertension successfully underwent coronary artery by pass grafting (CABG) and was extubated 48 hours after surgery. Patient had atrial fibrillation on 3rd post-operative day requiring loading dose of amiodarone followed by maintenance dose to control the arrhythmia. On 4th post operative day patient became tachypnoiec and required higher concentration of oxygen to maintain SpO2 >90%. There was new infiltrates on the x-ray, which was more on right side. Initially treated as pulmonary infection and antifailure measures. The patient did not respond and the lesions progressed to opaque hemithorax by the 10th postoperative day. On 11th POD he was reintubated due to respiratory distress. After excluding pulmonary infections, pulmonary oedema, embolism and vascular obstruction, the possibility of drug induced pulmonary toxicity was considered. Hence amiodarone was withdrawn and steroid was initiated. There was good radiological and gas exchange improvement and he was extubated the following day. After one week course of steroids the infiltrates cleared and oxygenation also improved. Post CABG patients are prone for acute amiodarone toxicity and high index of suspicion is needed to diagnose this early so that fatal complication can be averted by timely intervention.

Abstract: Amiodarone use is often limited by pulmonary toxicity. Amiodarone lung disease (ALD) classically manifests as organizing pneumonia with intra-alveolar foamy macrophages, but other patterns may also occur. Here we report 2 previously unreported patterns of ALD: lymphoid hyperplasia (LH) and eosinophilic pneumonia (EP). We identified patients with LH or EP as a prominent feature among 75 cases of probable ALD from the authors' teaching files collected from 1997 to 2010. Clinical history and lung wedge biopsies were reviewed. Twelve patients (7 men) met inclusion criteria (median age, 71 y). The exact amiodarone dose was known in all cases (median, 200 mg/d). Treatment duration was known in 10 cases and ranged from 1 to 12 years. Thoracic imaging showed diffuse infiltrates causing concern for a diagnosis of ALD. Histologic review revealed intra-alveolar foamy macrophages in all cases. Eight cases prominently displayed patterns of LH, including diffuse LH (7), follicular bronchiolitis (5), lymphoid interstitial pneumonia (2), and lymphocytic perivascular cuffing (2). Two showed features of acute EP, including diffuse alveolar damage with abundant eosinophils. Two showed features of chronic EP, including interstitial pneumonia with abundant eosinophils, patchy organization, and fibrinous exudates with macrophages and eosinophils. One chronic EP case also showed focal LH. Additional features included intra-alveolar giant cells (6), pleuritis (3), small poorly formed granulomas (3), and thrombi (2). LH and EP are previously unrecognized histopathologic manifestations of ALD, and amiodarone exposure should be included in their differential diagnosis.

Abstract: Propylthiouracil (PTU) therapy is associated with a variety of adverse reactions, among the most rare being interstitial pneumonia. To date, this has been reported in four Asian patients with autoimmune hyperthyroidism. Here we describe a Caucasian woman who developed a bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP)-like interstitial pneumonia after PTU administration for amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis.
The patient was a 68-year-old woman who had been treated with amiodarone for chronic atrial fibrillation starting in May 2004. She had been a heavy smoker with a history of hypertension but no dust exposures. In October 2006, amiodarone was stopped after she developed thyrotoxicosis. In January 2007 serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) was 0.01 mIU/L (0.35-4.94) and free T4 was 17.5 pg/mL (7 to 15). She was initially started on methimazole and then changed to PTU after she developed pruritus. She developed severe dyspnea 9 months after starting PTU. At the time she was also taking warfarin, enalapril, and sotalol. Chest X-ray showed diffuse interstitial peripheral opacities and transbronchial lung biopsy revealed subacute lung injury with organizing pneumonia with hyperplasia of the alveolar type 2 pneumocytes, and characteristics of BOOP-like interstitial pneumonia. Signs and symptoms progressively improved after PTU discontinuation as confirmed at X-ray and computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest and by respiratory function tests. She has been recurrence free for 4 years after stopping PTU.
This woman of Caucasian ancestral origin developed BOOP-like interstitial pneumonia after PTU treatment for apparent amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis, with resolution of her lung disease after stopping PTU. Tests for TSH receptor antibodies, thyroid peroxidase antibodies, and antinuclear cytoplasmic autoantibody were negative. Thyroid ultrasound was consistent with thyroiditis without nodules.
PTU-associated interstitial pneumonia is not limited to patients of Asian origin or those with autoimmune thyroid disease. PTU must be withdrawn in the presence of respiratory symptoms and documented interstitial pneumonia. X-ray films, CT-scan, respiratory function tests, and lung biopsy are needed to diagnose PTU-induced interstitial pneumonia with certainty and to monitor the evolution of the disease after PTU discontinuation.

Abstract: Long QT syndrome is characterized by electrocardiographic appearance of long QT intervals and propensity to polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. Aggressive anticipatory clinical management is required for a good outcome, especially in the symptomatic neonate. We present a neonate with a compound mutation with refractory ventricular tachycardia that necessitated multimodal pharmacotherapy with lidocaine, esmolol, and amiodarone along with ventricular pacing. Despite normal serum lidocaine levels, complex pharmacokinetic interactions resulted in presumed neurotoxicity due to lidocaine. This report discusses the implications and challenges of management of a neonate with compound long mutations.

Abstract: Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) is a common tachyarrhythmia in the pediatric population that can necessitate immediate treatment. Adenosine has been well studied as a mainstay treatment, but the methods of adenosine administration have not been very well delineated. The intraosseous technique has presented itself as a possible method of administration. We describe 2 cases in which adenosine was administered through bone marrow infusion to convert SVT without success. The cases we describe show that intraosseous is not a reliable method of administering adenosine to stop SVT. Both patients presented with SVT refractory to vagal maneuvers and difficult intravenous placement. Intraosseous access was achieved, but administration of adenosine at increasing doses was unable to successfully convert the arrhythmia.

Abstract: Amiodarone is a widely used antiarrythmic drug for various atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. It has the potential to cause prolongation of the QT interval, which, in turn, can increases the incidence of torsade de pointes. Amiodarone is also one of the causes of prominent U waves. The presented case exemplifies the phenomenon of amiodarone-induced T-U fusion and QT prolongation. Other causes of QT prolongation as electrolyte abnormalities or administration of other drugs that prolong the QT interval were excluded. Awareness of this phenomenon and method of calculation of QT interval in this scenario is of utmost importance.

Abstract: A woman presented with broad complex tachycardia. She was converted to sinus rhythm with intravenous amiodarone and continued on oral amiodarone. The amiodarone was stopped 3 weeks later as she was pregnant. Electrocardiogram (ECG) then revealed coved-type ST elevation in C1, suggestive of Brugada syndrome, and widespread inferior ST elevation. Electrocardiogram several months later showed resolution of inferior ST elevation.

Abstract: Hyperthyroidism is a common side effect encountered in patients prescribed long-term amiodarone therapy for cardiac arrhythmias. We previously studied 354 patients prescribed amiodarone in whom the occurrence of hyperthyroidism was associated with major adverse cardiovascular events including heart failure, myocardial infarction, ventricular arrhythmias, stroke and even death [1]. We now present a case of amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism complicated by isolated right heart failure and pulmonary hypertension that resolved with treatment of hyperthyroidism. Detailed quantitative echocardiography enables improved understanding of the haemodynamic mechanisms underlying the condition.

Abstract: Amiodarone (AM)-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) is a condition with uncertainties from the diagnostic and therapeutic standpoints. A 54-year old male was referred to the hospital due to thyrotoxicosis. He had history of atrial fibrillation medicated with AM. No history of pre-existing thyroid disease was present, thyroid palpation revealed no goiter, and there were no signs of Graves' ophthalmopathy. Thyroid autoantibodies and thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor antibodies (TRABs) were negative. Thyroid and Doppler ultrasounds were normal. 99mTc-sestaMIBI thyroid scan (STS) showed uptake with rapid washout. AM therapy was discontinued, and combined therapy was started. After a long course of glucocorticoid and thionamides, the patient became euthyroid. It is necessary to distinguish between the types of AIT to decide whether or not continue AM treatment; after that, the appropriate therapy should be selected. STS was very important in the diagnosis of the type of AIT.

Abstract: In 1988, Tumiati et al described the first case of calcinosis cutis related to a calcium-containing heparin. Since then, only 18 cases have been reported in the literature; they usually have an altered calcium-phosphate product, an elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH), or both. We report a 33-year-old patient who developed calcinosis cutis at sites of nadroparin injections without any disturbance of calcium-phosphate product, PTH, or vitamin D. The pathogenesis of calcinosis cutis secondary to nadroparin injections remains controversial; Proposed causes included metastatic, dystrophic, iatrogenic, or multifactorial etiologies. This is the first case of multiple nodules of calcinosis cutis without alterations of calcium-phosphate product, PTH, or vitamin D, which supports an iatrogenic mechanism. We also suggest that calcinosis cutis could be more frequent than we thought and is probably an underdiagnosed entity.

Abstract: Increases of pacing threshold stimulation are well documented with different antiarrhythmic drugs, but not with amiodarone. We report a case of a patient with dual-chamber pacing, with stable thresholds on repeated measurements on the last year, who presented severe increase of atrial pacing threshold resulting in loss of atrial capture after a year of treatment with amiodarone. Thresholds were normalized once amiodarone was removed. Ventricular thresholds were not affected.

Abstract: We report a case of Volkmann's-like syndrome occurred after an extravasation of 300 mg of cordarone administrated for a cardiac arrest.The day following the extravasation, an extensive necrosis of the skin and soft tissues occurred. The patient progressively developed a retraction of the muscles of her forearm. To the best of our knowledge this is first the reported case of an acute necrosis of the soft tissue inducing a Volkmann's-like retraction of the upper limb subsequent to a cordarone extravasation. The imaging findings are provided along with a review of the literature.

Abstract: To report a case of amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) concomitant with thyroid cancer in multinodular goiter (MNG).
A 61-year-old man treated with amiodarone for 5 years presented with mild sweating. He was found to have AIT simultaneously with thyroid papillary cancer and MNG. Administration of amiodarone was stopped, and he was treated with methimazole for AIT. Five weeks after the initial treatment, thyroid function normalized. Total thyroidectomy was considered to enable use of amiodarone again.
This case showed that thyrotoxicosis, MNG and amiodarone may contribute to thyroid carcinogenesis. Amiodarone should be carefully commenced in cases with MNG.

Abstract: A 57-year-old man who had been receiving chemotherapy for multiple myeloma complained of chest pain and was diagnosed with coronary artery disease. Coronary artery bypass grafting without cardiopulmonary bypass was performed smoothly, and extubation was done in the operating room. The next evening, cluster of ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation triggered by ventricular premature contractions occurred and required multiple electrical defibrillations. Despite intravenous administration of lidocaine, amiodarone, magnesium, and β-blocker, the storm sustained and was suppressed only by temporary ventricular overdrive pacing. He was discharged on foot.

Abstract: A number of drugs can cause cutaneous hyperpigmentation through a variety of mechanisms. The pigment is comprised of dermal deposits of the drug and its metabolites, often combined with melanin and hemosiderin. Minocycline and amiodarone are among the most common medications to cause skin-induced pigmentation. Affected individuals generally develop slate-gray pigmentation in affected sites. Treatment with various Q-switched lasers has been shown to be effective at removing drug-induced pigmentation. The author presents a man with amiodarone pigmentation of the face who responded to treatment with the Q-switched neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Nd:YAG) laser.

Abstract: This case report describes incessant monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT), not torsade de pointes, induced by intravenous amiodarone in a 48-year-old woman with dilated cardiomyopathy. VT was reproducibly triggered by short coupled premature ventricular complex (PVC) with different morphology from VT. After amiodarone infusion, the coupling interval of initiating PVC was prolonged, and moreover, the morphology of initiating PVC became the same as that of VT. Though amiodarone has become the first line drug to treat ventricular tachyarrhythmias in patients with cardiac dysfunction, it is important to be aware of its proarrhythmic effect, which may lead to an electrical storm of monomorphic VT.

Abstract: A 59-year-old patient with dilated cardiomyopathy and incessant ventricular tachycardia leading to progressive cardiogenic shock is presented. Due to hemodynamic instability, high dose catecholamines were required in addition to the implantation of an intraaortic balloon pump (IABP), which, however, appeared to further augment the frequency and duration of ventricular tachycardias. The implantation of a microaxial blood pump allowed catecholamine administration to be terminated, thereby, ending this vicious circle of catecholamine-driven electrical storm. Within 5 days, the patient was hemodynamically stabilized and kidney and liver function recovered with the support of intensive antiarrhythmic therapy (amiodarone, mexiletine, sotalol). During a 24-month follow-up, the patient had no further ICD shocks and no rehospitalization was required for treatment of congestive heart failure.

Abstract: To describe a patient with resolution of cornea verticillata while still using amiodarone as a result of a drug interaction lowering serum levels of amiodarone.
An 83-year-old retired physician with long-standing cornea verticillata was noted to have complete resolution of cornea verticillata on a routine follow-up eye examination. The patient reported complete compliance with using amiodarone daily, with no recent changes in dosage or formulation. Despite this, he reported a recent increase in the frequency of palpitations. He had recently started rifampin for treatment of tuberculosis.
Serum amiodarone and desethylamiodarone levels were obtained and found to be below therapeutic range. After rifampin was discontinued, serum amiodarone and desethylamiodarone levels increased to a therapeutic range and cornea verticillata returned after 4 months.
In patients currently using amiodarone, clearing of cornea verticillata should alert the ophthalmologists to the possibility of decreased serum amiodarone levels.

Abstract: The proliferation signal inhibitors (PSIs)-sirolimus, everolimus, and temsirolimus-have been associated with a noninfectious pneumonitis characterized by lymphocytic alveolitis and bronciolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia (BOOP). This condition usually occurs within the first year. Herein we presented a case of a deceased donor renal transplant with interstitial pneumonitis developing 6 years after a switch from tacrolimus to sirolimus due to chronic graft dysfunction. After the addition of intravenous pentamidine due to the suspicion of Pneumocystis pneumonia, there was marked clinical deterioration requiring intubation. Open lung biopsy revealed sirolimus-induced pulmonary toxicity (BOOP) with the additional finding of a drug-induced phospholipidosis (DIPL) that we ascribe to pentamidine treatment. After cessation of both drugs and application of corticosteroid therapy, there was only partial improvement. Eight months later the residual interstitial fibrosis demands supplemental home oxygen. We review the literature on PSI-induced pneumonitis and discuss the pathophysiology of a potential interaction with pentamidine. We caution against its use in the setting of PSI-induced pneumonitis. It is currently unknown whether these concerns also apply to prescription of other more commonly used medications associated with DIPL, eg, amiodarone and aminoglycosides.

Abstract: We present a case of fetal-neonatal acute myocarditis caused by coxsackievirus B3 infection in a term neonate. The condition manifested as high-grade atrioventricular (A-V) block prenatally. After delivery, various arrhythmias such as high-grade A-V block, ventricular tachycardia, and junctional ectopic tachycardia appeared, and we had difficulty managing these arrhythmias. This is the first report describing a case of acute myocarditis due to coxsackievirus infection presenting with fetal A-V block. This case is also unique in that it is extremely rare that various arrhythmias occur serially in one patient without left ventricular dysfunction.

Abstract: A 58-year-old man presented with chest pain and tightness and was diagnosed with a Q-wave anterior myocardial infarction. He then developed pulseless ventricular arrhythmias, which were treated with repeated direct-current shocks and intravenous amiodarone. He underwent emergency cardiac catheterization: stents were deployed in the left anterior descending coronary artery and right coronary artery, and an intra-aortic balloon pump was inserted. Severe refractory cardiogenic shock and incessant ventricular arrhythmias compelled us to place a TandemHeart percutaneous left ventricular assist device 4 hours later. The patient's hemodynamic status stabilized, but the arrhythmias persisted for 36 hours. Multiple doses of intravenous amiodarone and lidocaine and multiple external direct-current shocks were all tried, but these measures failed to terminate the life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. We performed a pharmacologic block of the left stellate ganglion, and this resulted in a return to sinus rhythm after 1 direct-current shock. To our knowledge, this is the 1st patient with refractory ventricular arrhythmias to have been treated with TandemHeart support and left stellate ganglion block.

Abstract: To describe a case of elevated international normalized ratio (INR) after addition of dronedarone to warfarin therapy.
A 72-year-old white female with a history of tinnitus, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and permanent pacemaker implantation was taking warfarin (target INR 2-3) and sotalol for chronic atrial fibrillation; atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia; and risedronate for osteopenia. Her warfarin therapy had been managed by a nurse-run anticoagulation clinic for several years. During the prior year, her INR had been stable with a weekly dose of warfarin 25 mg. After persistent episodes of atrial fibrillation, the antiarrhythmic agent was changed from sotalol to dronedarone 400 mg twice daily. Approximately 10 days after starting dronedarone, the INR was 4.8; she stated that there was no bleeding. The warfarin dose was decreased to 20 mg/wk, and the INR remained stable with that dosage for the next 11 months.
Postmarketing surveillance has revealed cases of increased INR values with or without bleeding in patients taking warfarin who were started on dronedarone. In this case, the Horn Drug Interaction Probability Scale suggested a probable causality for an interaction between dronedarone and warfarin. Based on current knowledge, this interaction may involve an indirect gastrointestinal mechanism and/or a direct pharmacokinetic mechanism.
Clinicians should monitor patients who are taking warfarin and dronedarone for INR changes and bleeding episodes about 1 week after initiation of dronedarone. If a significant interaction is noted, the warfarin dosage should be decreased and the patient should be monitored within 2 weeks to assess the need for further adjustments.

Abstract: Emergency medical services (EMS) encountered an alert patient with sustained ventricular fibrillation with preserved hemodynamics via a left ventricular assist device (LVAD). Multiple firings of the patient's implantable defibrillator were the only sign that this patient was experiencing the usually fatal ventricular arrhythmia. Initial attempts at rhythm conversion with amiodarone and 200-J biphasic shocks were unsuccessful. The patient was finally defibrillated to normal sinus rhythm after a 360-J biphasic shock. This case conference highlights the increasing prevalence of LVADs. These devices are used not only as a bridge to cardiac transplantation, but also as definitive therapy for patients in end-stage cardiac failure. Ventricular fibrillation has been shown to be well tolerated in patients with LVADs, and we discuss a standard of care for these patients. The occurrence of sustained ventricular fibrillation in patients with ventricular assist devices represents a challenging situation for EMS and emergency department providers and one that will be increasingly encountered in the future.

Abstract: Giant cell myocarditis is a rare but often devastating disease affecting young, otherwise healthy individuals. Patients often die of heart failure and ventricular arrhythmia unless cardiac transplantation is performed. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging with or without cardiac biopsy can be helpful in making the correct diagnosis and ensuring that correct timely treatment is administered.

Abstract: Highlight the management of a critically ill premature hydropic baby with refractory atrial flutter (AF) and successful outcome without neurologic sequel at 1 year of follow-up.
A 23-year-old pregnant woman, G1PO, presented with fetal tachycardia at 32 weeks.
Ultrasound revealed a hydropic fetus with fetal atrial rate (FHR) of 440 bpm and A:V block of 2:1. Transplacental therapy resulted in a temporary response with the combination of digoxin and flecainide, and subsequently digoxin plus sotalol. Termination of pregnancy at 34 weeks was performed for postnatal treatment, giving birth to a premature hydropic baby, weighing 3320 grams. At birth flecainide failed to control the AF Therefore, intravenous adenosine was started and successful conversion to normal sinus rhythm was temporally achieved. Finally, conversion to normal sinus rhythm with amiodarone plus digoxin was satisfactorily achieved and then long-term control with only oral flecainide. The hydropic signs gradually disappeared without any significant sequelae. The baby was healthy at one year of follow-up without any neurological sequelae.
This case may be evidence that combined therapy with amiodarone and digoxin is probably effective in treatment of refractory AF with hydropic changes, at least in some cases.

Abstract: Regular broad QRS complex tachycardias may be ventricular in origin or due to supraventricular tachycardia with aberrancy. Antidromic atrioventricular re-entrant tachycardia occurring in Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome is a third possibility. The electrocardiogram is a key tool for distinguishing these tachycardias, which have differing causes, prognoses and treatment strategies. Ventricular tachycardia may be monomorphic or polymorphic. The management of ventricular tachycardia depends on clinical symptoms and is influenced by the presence of structural heart disease.

Abstract: A 70-year-old patient with 3-vessel coronary artery disease and a left ventricular aneurysm underwent coronary artery bypass grafting, together with a surgical anterior ventricular endocardial restoration (SAVER) procedure. Four days later, he suddenly developed recurrent sustained and nonsustained polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, preceded by monomorphic ventricular premature contractions, and did not respond to any antiarrhythmic drug, including lidocaine, esmolol, or amiodarone. Repeated electrical cardioversion procedures were performed (28 in total). Mapping was performed to target the earliest site of activation in the left ventricle during the ventricular premature contractions, a site where the premature beats were preceded by Purkinje potentials. That site was located along a scar border-zone. Ablation at that site resulted in the disappearance of the monomorphic ventricular premature contractions and in the complete suppression of the electrical storm. These findings appear to indicate that the area in which the Purkinje potentials were recorded along the scar border-zone played an important role in the mechanism of the polymorphic ventricular tachycardia after myocardial infarction.

Abstract: Aluminum Phosphide or rice tablet is one of the most common pesticides which leads to accidental or intentional acute intoxication and finally death. In this paper, we describe a successful management of intoxication with rice tablet in a young girl.
A 14-year-old girl was admitted due to consumption of rice tablet. Gastric washing with two vials of sodium bicarbonate and discharge suction was done. In the first 24 hours, the patient underwent recurrent hydration, dopamine infusion with sodium bicarbonate, calcium, magnesium and amiodarone. On the second day of admission, the patient was transferred to intensive care unit (ICU) and five days later, she was discharged without liver or renal complications.
Short interval between consumption of this tablet and start of the treatment and on time rescue to the patient can be some of the important factors to prevent early death in intoxication with this tablet.

Abstract: Myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, is a well-known, albeit rare complication of statin therapy. Predisposing factors include comorbidities and the concomitant use of cytochrome P-450 (CYP) 3A4 inhibitors. We report a case of severe simvastatin-induced rhabdomyolysis triggered by the addition of amiodarone to previously well-tolerated chronic statin therapy. Physicians should be aware of the risk of this potentially severe drug interaction. The dose of simvastatin should be reduced (to 20 mg daily) when concomitant treatment with amiodarone is required, or preference should be given to pravastatin, rosuvastatin or fluvastatin, which are not metabolised by the CYP 3A4.

Abstract: The central role of thyrotropin receptor antibodies (TRAbs) in the pathogenesis of Graves' disease has been recognised for several decades. However, the practical application of testing for TRAbs in clinical decision making remains the subject of controversy. The diagnosis of Graves' disease can be made in most cases simply based on a patient's clinical presentation. The TRAb test is therefore of most value in ambiguous clinical scenarios such as in the differential diagnosis of unilateral exophthalmos, euthyroid Graves' ophthalmopathy, subclinical hyperthyroidism, thyrotoxicosis associated with hyperemesis gravidarum, amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis and painless thyroiditis. It may also have a role in predicting the risk of a recurrence of Graves' disease following a course of antithyroid drug treatment. One further clinical utility of the TRAb test is in pregnancy where antibody titre measured during the third trimester is used to predict the risk of neonatal thyroid dysfunction. The TRAb titre not only aids in clinching a difficult diagnosis but can also help guide treatment in some patients. Although the TRAb assay has become more affordable in recent years, cost remains an important factor when considering its use routinely. Nonetheless, this is an underutilised blood test that could augment standard endocrine investigations in the differential diagnosis of hyperthyroidism.

Abstract: Dronedarone is a relatively new antiarrhythmic drug approved for paroxysmal or persistent atrial fibrillation. Dronedarone can inhibit P-glycoprotein-mediated digoxin clearance and increase steady-state digoxin level 2.5 times. It is important to closely monitor plasma digoxin levels or administer a lower loading dose of digoxin in patients taking dronedarone concomitantly. We report a case of digoxin toxicity in a patient taking concomitant dronedarone as a result of interaction between digoxin and dronedarone.

Abstract: Extracorporeal life support (ECLS) to manage acute antiarrhythmic drugs toxicity in neonates has never been reported. Here presented is a case of venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support in a newborn with refractory low cardiac output as a result of acute Ca-channel and β-receptor antagonist toxicity for treatment of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). Shortly after onset of ECLS, the baby recovered sinus rhythm and subsequent bouts of SVT were controlled by amiodarone infusion and repeated DC shocks. Weaning was possible on the 5th day after implant, once recovery of the left ventricular function and optimization of the antiarrhythmic medication were achieved. In neonates with severe but potentially reversible cardiac dysfunction caused by drug toxicity, ECLS can maintain cardiac output and vital organ perfusion while allowing time for drug redistribution, metabolism, and clearance.

Abstract: Amiodarone use has been rarely associated with the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), usually in association with surgery or pulmonary angiography. In patients with preexisting left ventricular dysfunction, the diagnosis may be overlooked.
A 92-year-old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation who was on low-dose amiodarone presented to the Emergency Department with sudden onset of shortness of breath. The patient was started on treatment for acute heart failure based on the physical examination and the elevated brain natriuretic peptide level. Despite adequate diuresis, the patient showed no improvement. A chest computed tomography scan revealed acute interstitial pneumonitis. The patient received corticosteroids due to suspected amiodarone-induced acute interstitial pneumonitis resulting in ARDS. She returned to her baseline activity within 2 weeks of the therapy.
Although rare, clinicians should be vigilant for amiodarone-induced acute interstitial pneumonitis resulting in ARDS, as delay in treatment may result in a high risk of mortality. In addition, the development of ARDS occurred in our patient in the absence of precipitating factors such as surgery or pulmonary angiography.

Abstract: A 50-year-old woman with arterial hypertension suffered from recurrent syncope. On admission, recurrent torsades de pointes tachycardia, ventricular flutter, and ventricular fibrillation with the necessity of cardiopulmonary resuscitation were documented. After administration of β-blocking agents, amiodarone, and magnesium, heart rhythm was stabilized. Coronary angiography excluded coronary artery disease. Echocardiography revealed apical ballooning with reduced ventricular function. The ECG showed left bundle-branch block and profound QT prolongation. A WCD (wearable cardioverter-defibrillator) LifeVest was prescribed for the patient, and, thereafter, no arrhythmias were experienced. The ECG gradually normalized; echocardiography revealed slight anteroapical hypokinesia with overall normal left ventricular function. After a period of 3 months, the patient was no longer asked to wear the LifeVest; 6 months later the patient is without any complaints.

Abstract: Amiodarone is a class III antiarrhythmic agent that is widely used in the treatment of a variety of arrhythmias. Several different systemic side effects are reported after use of this medication. In this article, we report a case that had developed syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) after starting treatment with this agent.
The patient is a 66-year-old male with past medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, and class III New York Heart Association congestive heart failure who presented with monomorphic nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. A loading dose of amiodarone followed by maintenance dose was started. Baseline serum sodium of 138 mmol/L on admission decreased to 119 mmol/L by day 7, and a diagnosis of SIADH was made. The patient was not taking any other medication known to cause SIADH, nor had any such comorbidity to explain it. Serum sodium increased to 133 and 138 mmol/L, respectively, after 16 and 33 days from discontinuation of amiodarone.
SIADH is a rare but serious side effect of amiodarone and practicing physicians should be aware of this complication, particularly after loading dose of the medication.

Abstract: Amiodarone, which has been used since 1967 as an antiarrhythmic drug, gives rise to a variety of cardiac and extracardiac adverse side-effects. Among these, pulmonary toxicity is considered the most frequent and serious extracardiac side-effect, since it may occur in various atypical forms and often limits the drug's clinical use. We encountered a 67-year-old white male patient with suspected amiodarone pneumonitis characterized by multiple lung nodules associated with pleural and pericardial effusion and peripheral neuropathy. Because differential diagnosis with pulmonary infectious diseases may be extremely difficult, the attending physician should therefore bear in mind the possibility of amiodarone pneumonitis whenever the drug is given.

Abstract: Inhalation or ingestion of aluminum phosphide (AP) generates phosphine gas on exposure to moisture, which, in turn, produces widespread organ toxicity primarily involving the lungs, heart, liver, and kidneys. Cardiac manifestations of AP poisoning include toxic myocarditis, refractory heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, and tachyarrhythmias including ventricular tachycardia (VT). A 19-year-old depressed male farm worker ingested ten 500-mg tablets of Celphos in a suicide attempt. Each Celphos tablet contains 56% AP. Over the course of 10 hours, the patient developed heart failure and respiratory failure associated with a rise in serum troponin level to 12.7 ng/mL. Serum electrolytes (including magnesium) and serum creatinine levels were normal throughout. His course was further complicated by acidemia and hypotension. These hemodynamic and metabolic abnormalities were initially corrected by assisted ventilation and continuous veno-venous hemofiltration. However, he developed hemodynamically stable sustained monomorphic VT, which proved unresponsive to treatment with intravenous magnesium sulfate and intravenous amiodarone therapy. After a decline in blood pressure, 6 attempts at electrocardioversion failed to restore sinus rhythm, and he died. Postmortem histologic examination of myocardium showed contraction band necrosis, early coagulation necrosis, edema, hemorrhage, and pyknosis of cardiac myocyte nuclei. Ventricular tachycardia associated with AP poisoning has been successfully treated with magnesium sulfate, amiodarone, and electrocardioversion. This case report documents failure of all 3 of these therapeutic modalities.

Abstract: Thyrotoxicosis caused by destructive thyroiditis is self-limited and results from the subacute release of preformed thyroid hormone. Common etiologies include painful subacute thyroiditis and silent (painless) subacute thyroiditis (including postpartum thyroiditis, amiodarone-associated destructive thyroiditis, and lithium-associated thyroiditis). Thyrotoxicosis commonly evolves slowly over a matter of weeks.
We report a unique case of severe thyrotoxicosis caused by acute- onset painful destructive thyroiditis in a patient who received large amounts of nonionic contrast dye Hexabrix® for cardiac catheterization. The results of thyroid function and physical examination were normal before the catheterization.
The acute onset of severe thyroid pain, rapid increase in serum Free Thyroxine Index, and thyroglobulin concentrations with a triiodothyronine to free thyroxine index ratio of < 20 to 1 were compatible with an acute onset destructive thyroiditis, likely related to direct toxicity from the iodinated contrast material.
In light of the large number of patients who receive these contrast agents during cardiac catheterization, clinicians should be advised of this potentially serious complication, particularly in the setting of unstable cardiac disease.

Abstract: Amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant useful for the treatment of depression. Amiodarone is a class III antiarrhythmic agent used for the treatment of cardiac dysrhythmias.
The objective of the current report is to describe the case of a previously asymptomatic patient receiving amitriptyline who developed extrapyramidal symptoms within 1 month of initiating concomitant treatment with amiodarone for atrial fibrillation.
An 82-year-old, right-handed, white woman was brought to the medical center's emergency department with speech difficulty suggesting stroke. She was noted to have continuous orobuccal dyskinesias, upper and lower extremity shaking, and dry mouth. Once it was determined that no other focal neurologic findings indicated stroke, her medications were reviewed. The patient had been taking amitriptyline 50 mg/d for the past year for insomnia without any adverse events. However, 1 month before presentation, she also initiated treatment with amiodarone 200 mg/d for atrial fibrillation and had developed the symptoms of concern shortly thereafter. The patient's amitriptyline treatment was discontinued and she received benzotropine for extrapyramidal symptoms from amitriptyline toxicity. She experienced complete resolution of dysarthric speech and limb shaking within 2 days. A total score of 7 was achieved using Naranjo's adverse drug reaction causality algorithm, suggesting amitriptyline was a probable cause of these adverse events.
This was a probable case of extrapyramidal symptoms in an elderly woman who began using amiodarone while also taking amitriptyline.

Abstract: Amiodarone is a one of the most commonly used antiarrhythmic drug with efficacy in both supraventricular and ventricular tachycardia. Hepatic, pulmonary, and thyroid adverse effect profiles of this drug are well described and mandate a close follow-up. We report a case of amiodarone-related hyponatremia, which is one of the rarest side effects associated with this medication and our case was unlike other previous case reports because severity of symptoms required hemodialysis for correction of hyponatremia despite trying dose reduction strategy.

Abstract: Flumazenil is one of imidazo-benzodiazepine (Anexate) which has been generally used as benzodiazepine competitive antagonist for the treatment of benzodiazepine intoxication during recent decades. Some has recommended diagnostic usage in ICU as well, for suspected benzodiazepine intoxicated cases. In this study we present a patient intoxicated with lorazepam who developed a ventricular tachycardia after receiving flumazenil as therapeutic mean, though the attack was appropriately terminated by administration of a bolus dose of Amiodarone. We believe that the ventricular tachycardia onset in above mentioned case is secondary to Flumazenil administration in susceptible patient with previous history of ischemic heart disease. Ventricular tachycardia has rarely reported as flumazenil side effects.

Abstract: Amiodarone is a class III antiarrhythmic agent that is frequently prescribed today for the treatment of ventricular and atrial arrhythmias. Amiodarone has many adverse effects, and one of them is thyroid dysfunction. Advanced practice and staff nurses need to be vigilant, recognizing early signs and symptoms of thyroid dysfunction to prevent adverse drug reactions. Often, the signs and symptoms of amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism are overlooked because of the complexity of the patient's condition. The purpose of this article was to review a case study, present differential diagnoses and testing, discuss risk factors associated with amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism, discuss its pathogenesis, and review clinical management.

Abstract: Long QT syndrome (LQTS) is a disorder of myocardial repolarization characterized by a prolonged QT interval on the electrocardiogram (ECG). This disorder is associated with an increased risk of torsade de pointes (TdP). We report a case of TdP induced by citalopram, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), taken in conjunction with amiodarone.

Abstract: Chaotic or multifocal atrial tachycardia (MAT) is a rare tachyarrhythmia in children, accounting for less than 1% of supraventricular tachycardia seen in childhood. The majority of children with MAT are healthy; a few may exhibit mild to life threatening cardiorespiratory disease.
To report a new case of MAT revealed by a severe respiratory distress and cardiogenic shock.
We report a rare case of MAT revealed by a severe respiratory distress and cardiogenic shock in a 12-day-old newborn. The echocardiogram demonstrated an isolated secundum-type atrial septal defect with a decreased left ventricular function. He was successfully treated with intravenous amiodarone. A relay by oral amiodarone and digoxine was made. Four months later, he had no recurrence of arrhythmia and left ventricular function returned to normal.
Our case is original by its association to an isolated ostium secondum-type atrial septal defect and by the occurrence of a congestive heart failure revealing the arrhythmia and the structural heart disease during the neonatal period.

Abstract: A 24-year-old male patient was admitted to the coronary intensive care unit with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. He was given amiodarone (Cordarone 150 mg i.v., Sanofi-Aventis) intravenous loading dose of 300 mg in 100 mL dextrose 5% in water (D5W) over 1 hour, followed by a maintenance dose of 900 mg in 500 mL D5W for infusion up to 24 hours. At the emergency department, the patient was conscious and cooperative; his pretreatment arterial blood pressure was 120/80 mm Hg, and the arrhythmic tachycardia was 145 per minute. After intravenous amiodarone loading and half an hour into maintenance infusion, extreme perspiration, hypotension (blood pressure immeasurable), and mild cyanosis developed. The patient was conscious; his auscultation and pulse were normal. He was given physiologic serum and dopamine support. Approximately an hour later, the blood pressure was measurable. Infusion was terminated because of suspicion of an allergic reaction to acetylsalicylic acid or amiodarone. The allergic reaction observed was attributed to acetylsalicylic acid and amiodarone; infusion was resumed when the clinical situation worsened during the maintenance infusion. Once again, the patient was given physiologic serum (2000 mL), dopamine (20 mg/kg per minute), and, additionally, 250 mg of methyprednisolone sodium succinate intravenous, whereby the clinical condition improved within 20 minutes. Anaphylactic shock cases due to amiodarone are rare; it is important to take a history of drug-mediated anaphylaxis before prescribing amiodarone. An addition to a review of the literature regarding treatment of amiodarone-related anaphylactic shock cases had not been reported before.

Abstract: Cardiac adverse effects are not commonly reported complications of nebulized epinephrine therapy. We present a case of critical cardiac arrhythmia developed at the Pediatric Emergency Department in an otherwise healthy infant after receiving 3 mg of L-epinephrine (1:1000) nebulization over a 90 min period for a diagnosis of bronchiolitis. Unstable ventricular tachycardia was found after the nebulization therapy that required chemical cardioversion. Frequent premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) were found initially following the cardiac insult that was controlled with oral amiodarone, and disappeared during follow-up. Although epinephrine inhalation is generally safe, adverse life-threatening events could be unpredictable and may evolve even after a single dose of nebulized epinephrine.

Abstract: Amiodarone-induced thyroid dysfunction has been reported to affect 2-24% of users. Despite the easy management of amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism, the development of thyrotoxicosis leads to a difficult approach in most cases. The aim of this study is to describe three different cases of patients with amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis and discuss the clinical and laboratorial aspects, and the different approaches to them. It is essential to carefully evaluate patients before and during amiodarone therapy, since the prompt diagnosis and treatment of this condition is essential in patients with high cardiovascular risk.

Abstract: The authors describe an 11-year-old girl who presented with congestive heart failure due to arrhythmogenic dilated cardiomyopathy. She had curly, woolly hair since birth and palmoplantar keratoderma. Molecular genetic analysis of the desmoplakin gene revealed that she was homozygous for the c.3901C>T (p.Gln1301X) change in exon 23 of the desmoplakin (DSP) gene, confirming the diagnosis of Carvajal disease. As per the Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Dysplasia/ Cardiomyopathy Genetic Variants Database, this is a novel mutation. She was managed with diuretics, enalapril, carvedilol and amiodarone, is presently stable, and on regular follow-up. Carvajal disease is a rare cardiocutaneous disorder and few cases have been reported in the literature. The authors review the published cases of the Naxos-Carvajal phenotype from India. Pediatricians need to be aware of this clinical entity whenever arrhythmogenic dilated cardiomyopathy is associated with woolly hair and/or palmoplantar keratoderma.

Abstract: The authors describe a patient treated with amiodarone presented with high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels who did not respond to treatment with a statin. Both amiodarone and amiodarone induced hypothyroidism influence the synthesis of LDL-receptor which may explain the lack of effect of statin. This was confirmed by normalisation of LDL-C upon discontinuation of amiodarone and treatment with thyroxine.

Abstract: High-dose insulin (HDI) and intravenous fat emulsion (IFE) are used in overdoses, although rarely combined. To our knowledge, IFE therapy has not been reported in overdoses of diltiazem, metoprolol and amiodarone. We report a severe overdose of these drugs treated with HDI and IFE in a patient with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). We also discuss the potential clinical implications of the inotropic effects of HDI in the setting of HCM and the use and efficacy of IFE in this overdose.

Abstract: Cardiac involvement occurs frequently in primary amyloidosis and is associated with heart failure hospitalizations and poor survival. The initial presentation of the disease may be misleading, resulting in under-diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis and late initiation of treatment. We present a case of cardiac amyloidosis initially misdiagnosed as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and we discuss the key findings of the disease along with the latest evidence regarding the management and prognosis of cardiac amyloidosis.

Abstract: Amiodarone is a widely used antiarrhythmic drug whose use is significantly limited by numerous undesirable effects following long-term administration. In the literature so far, it has been reported that the most common acute adverse effect of the intravenous administration of amiodarone requiring intervention is hypotension. We present the case of a female patient who experienced low back pain after an intravenous loading dose of amiodarone.

Abstract: Amiodarone is used extensively in clinical practice for the treatment of arrhythmias but is associated with a number of well-known side effects. We present 3 cases of extensive thrombosis occurring secondary to intravenous amiodarone. In cases like these, amiodarone must be stopped immediately and patients started on appropriate anticoagulation therapy. Providing education to nursing and pharmacy staff regarding the administration of IV amiodarone and the necessity of defining institutional guidelines are central to decreasing the risk of complications from using this widely available antiarrhythmic agent.

Abstract: Patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy who undergo septal myectomy are at risk for developing postoperative atrial fibrillation. Amiodarone is effective in treating this arrhythmia but is associated with multiple adverse effects, often with delayed onset. A novel case is described of a patient who developed type 2 amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism that presented as recurrence of outflow obstruction after septal myectomy. The patient's symptoms and echocardiographic findings of outflow obstruction resolved substantially with the treatment of the amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism. Amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism of delayed onset can be a subtle diagnosis, requiring a high index of suspicion. In conclusion, recognition of this diagnosis in patients with recurrence of outflow obstruction by symptoms and cardiac imaging after septal myectomy may avoid unnecessary repeat surgical intervention.

Abstract: Idiopathic ventricular fibrillation is a rare entity seen in a very small subset of patients presenting to the emergency department. Management of ventricular arrhythmias in pregnant women is similar to that in nonpregnant women, but special consideration is given to avoid adverse fetal effects when selecting antiarrhythmic agents. Electrical defibrillation is the intervention of choice in both pregnant and nonpregnant patients with ventricular fibrillation of all etiologies. This was not associated with any significant adverse effects for mother or fetus. Although lidocaine and sotalol are Food and Drug Administration category B antiarrhythmics used in pregnancy, Food and Drug Administration category C antiarrhythmics such as β-blockers and category D drugs such as amiodarone can be used as pharmacologic adjuncts to facilitate termination of recurrent ventricular fibrillation where other agents have failed. Isoproterenol has been used to terminate recurrent ventricular fibrillation in patients with Brugada syndrome and torsades de pointes resistant to magnesium therapy. This case report describes a previously healthy 32-year-old pregnant woman with recurrent idiopathic ventricular fibrillation that failed to respond to standard therapy including electrical defibrillation, intravenous lidocaine, metoprolol, and amiodarone but eventually terminated with isoproterenol infusion.

Abstract: This 24-year-old woman had incessant polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (PVT) during week 24 of her pregnancy and received over 200 implantable cardioverter-defibrillator discharges. She failed to respond to quinidine, magnesium, isoproterenol, amiodarone, esmolol, and cilostazol during her PVT storm, although her dramatic response to verapamil was consistent with the diagnosis of short-coupled variant of torsades de pointes. The case illustrated the utility of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation during refractory PVT, while attempting diagnostic and therapeutic pharmacologic maneuvers.

Abstract: We report the case of a female patient presenting to the emergency department with postprandial syncope and atrial fibrillation. After amiodarone administration, the electrocardiogram showed marked QT prolongation associated with ventricular arrhythmias, including an episode of torsade de pointes requiring immediate electrical cardioversion. During history taking, the patient reported that she had been drinking large amounts of grapefruit juice regularly. The inhibition of amiodarone metabolism induced by grapefruit juice was responsible for enhancing the proarrhythmic effects of the drug with development of electrical storm.

Abstract: Acute hepatotoxicity is a rare but potentially fatal complication of amiodarone use. Although oral long-term use of the drug is frequently complicated by an asymptomatic rise in serum aminotransferase concentrations, acute hepatotoxicity during intravenous loading is much less frequent and potentially fatal. We report a case of liver injury after intravenous administration in a patient with atrial fibrillation.

Abstract: Optimal medical treatment, cardiac resynchronization, and the use of an implantable cardioverter defibrillator are established therapies of severe congestive heart failure. In refractory cases, left ventricular assist devices are more and more used not only as bridging to cardiac transplantation but also as destination therapy. Ventricular arrhythmias may represent a life-threatening condition and often result in clinical deterioration in patients with congestive heart failure. We report a case of asymptomatic sustained ventricular fibrillation with preserved hemodynamics caused by a nonpulsatile left ventricular assist device. Consecutive adequate but unsuccessful discharges of the implantable cardioverter defibrillator were the only sign of the usually fatal arrhythmia, prompting the patient to consult emergency services. Electrolyte supplementation and initiation of therapy with amiodarone followed by external defibrillation resulted in successful restoration of a stable cardiac rhythm after 3.5 hours.

Abstract: Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (formerly known as bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia) is a clinicopathological entity with characteristical radiographic findings such as bilateral, asymmetrical, sometimes migrating, patchy infiltrates in chest radiograph and ground-glass opacities in computed tomography. The disease has been observed in the context of gastrointestinal disorders, certain lung infections, autoimmune-mediated diseases (such as Wegener granulomatosis), inhalation of toxic fumes, bone marrow transplantation and administration of drugs. The benzofuran amiodarone, a commonly used antiarrythmic drug for atrial fibrillation, can exhibit several pulmonary adverse effects, amongst them cryptogenic organizing pneumonia as a rarely diagnosed and published one. We report a case of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia secondary to amiodarone treatment, its clinical course with significant improvement of clinical symptoms within a few days after discontinuation of amiodarone treatment and administration of corticosteroids. Also the infiltrations found in chest X-ray and computed tomography responded well and showed remarkable resolution tendency quickly. During 5 months of corticoid therapy pulmonary abnormalities gradually resolved almost completely and remained equal during the 8 months follow-up after corticoid termination.

Abstract: Intravenous injection of amiodarone, a class III anti-arrhythmic is widely used for persistent refractory arrhythmias. We present a case report suggesting the efficacy of amiodarone in refractory ventricular fibrillation (Vf) during weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). A 66-year-old woman with hypertension had a medical examination as a result of an episode of palpitations and syncope. Echocardiography and an invasive hemodynamic study revealed severe aortic stenosis (AS) with left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy because of calcified degeneration in a congenital bicuspid aortic valve (AV). Aortic valve replacement (AVR) was scheduled under general anesthesia and CPB. Intraoperative diagnosis was AS with calcified AV, LV hypertrophy, and aneurysm of ascending aorta (Ao). AVR with a biological valve, artificial vessel replacement of ascending Ao, and excision of the outflow myocardial septum were performed under CPB with intermittent antegrade blood cardioplegia at a body temperature (BT) of 24°C. The patient suffered from Vf at a BT of 35.3°C. Vf was not responsive to lidocaine 100 mg and 10 direct current (DC) shocks. After continuous intravenous infusion of amiodarone 225 mg/h for 10 min and a single intravenous injection of amiodarone 150 mg followed by a single DC shock, she returned to normal sinus rhythm. Sinus rhythm was maintained by continuous intravenous infusion of amiodarone 60 mg/h. Total CPB time was 5 h 43 min. Aortic cross-clamping time was 3 h 50 min. Administration of amiodarone is effective for refractory Vf resistant to lidocaine and cardioversion during weaning from CPB in cardiac surgery for heart diseases with LV hypertrophy.

Abstract: Management of symptomatic atrial arrhythmia in pregnancy remains a challenge. In this case report, a pregnant woman with incessant tachycardia underwent successful left atrial ablation. The entire procedure was performed without fluoroscopy.
A 20-year-old woman, 27 weeks pregnant, was admitted with congestive cardiac failure and incessant atrial tachycardia. She had an elevated brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and chest X-ray demonstrating heart failure. The 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) showed atrial tachycardia with a cycle length of 310 ms, inverted P waves in lead I and the inferior leads, and a ventricular rate of 84 bpm during 2:1 block. Echocardiogram showed a global reduction in left ventricular function with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 0.40. Electrical cardioversion failed. Rate control could not be achieved with beta-blockers and calcium antagonists. Amiodarone with repeat cardioversion was also unsuccessful. The patient then underwent catheter ablation. The entire procedure was performed using intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) and electroanatomical mapping with no fluoroscopy. Electrophysiology (EP) study and an activation map of the left atrium confirmed a focal left atrial tachycardia which was successfully ablated. Six weeks postablation, the left ventricular function had normalized and the patient delivered a healthy child at term, without complication.
Ablation of left atrial tachycardia using ICE and electroanatomical guidance is feasible in pregnant women.

Abstract: This is a case report of myxedema coma secondary to amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism in a patient with severe congestive heart failure (CHF). To our knowledge and after reviewing the literature there is one case report of myxedema coma during long term amiodarone therapy. Myxedema coma is a life threatening condition that carries a mortality reaching as high as 20% with treatment. The condition is treated with intravenous thyroxine (T4) or intravenous tri-iodo-thyronine (T3). Patients with CHF on amiodarone may suffer serious morbidity and mortality from hypothyroidism, and thus may deserve closer follow up for thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels. This case report carries an important clinical application given the frequent usage of amiodarone among CHF patients. The myriad clinical presentation of myxedema coma and its serious morbidity and mortality stresses the need to suspect this clinical syndrome among CHF patients presenting with hypotension, weakness or other unexplained symptoms.

Abstract: To describe a challenging patient case in which dronedarone was selected for a patient with atrial fibrillation and heart failure; the drug may have been associated with worsening heart failure, leading to acute renal and hepatic failure.
A 47-year-old male with a history of heart failure with New York Heart Association class III-IV symptoms presented to our institution with ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia storm. Torsade de pointes secondary to a combination of dofetilide and hypokalemia was determined to be the etiology. Upon stabilization, the patient was initiated on dronedarone 400 mg orally twice daily by the electrophysiology service for atrial fibrillation. The patient had a questionable history of amiodarone intolerance. By hospital day 9 (day 4 of dronedarone therapy), the patient demonstrated a clinical picture consistent with acute renal and hepatic failure possibly due to worsening heart failure. Dronedarone was discontinued on hospital day 10. He was subsequently transferred to an outside hospital where he required milrinone therapy for cardiogenic shock. Laboratory markers of renal and hepatic function improved over the remainder of his hospitalization and he was discharged on hospital day 20.
Dronedarone is a newly approved antiarrhythmic agent with multichannel blocking properties similar to amiodarone. Use of the Naranjo probability scale determined that this patient's worsening heart failure leading to acute renal and hepatic failure was possibly caused by dronedarone. The implication from the ANDROMEDA trial as well as our experience in this case is that dronedarone should be used cautiously in patients with heart failure and avoided in patients specifically outlined in the product labeling.
This case report, to our knowledge, represents the first published postmarketing report of worsening heart failure complicated by multiorgan dysfunction in the setting of dronedarone initiation. Dronedarone use must be approached with caution in patients with a history of heart failure.

Abstract: We describe a case of severe drug-induced interstitial pneumonitis in a woman with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension receiving epoprostenol confirmed by a drug T-cell proliferation assay. Proliferation assays were completed in our patient and in a healthy control. Isolated T cells were incubated with CD3-depleted peripheral blood mononuclear cells and then stimulated to proliferate with (3)H-thymidine in the presence of epoprostenol, other prostanoid analogs, and controls. A significant (p < 0.001) T-cell proliferation response occurred in our patient in the presence of epoprostenol alone. There was a trend towards an increased T-cell response to treprostinil but this was statistically insignificant. There was no significant T-cell response to the diluent alone, normal saline, iloprost, or alprostadil. There was no significant proliferation to any drug in the healthy control. Hence, a drug T-cell proliferation assay confirmed that epoprostenol can rarely incite a profound inflammatory response in the pulmonary interstitium.

Abstract: Amiodarone-induced thryrotoxicosis (AIT) is a rare but serious complication of amiodarone use, especially in patients with severe cardiac disease. We present a patient who developed AIT, following administration of amiodarone for life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. We discuss the medical management of AIT and anesthetic considerations for management of patients with thyrotoxicosis and severe cardiac disease who require surgery including thyroidectomy.

Abstract: The identification of the different subtypes of amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) may provide a rational basis for the choice of the appropriate medical treatment. The aim of this study was to evaluate differential diagnosis and treatment regimens of AIT in children and adolescent.
We reported 3 patients: A 6.7 years old boy with type I AIT; a 17.9 years old girl with type II AIT and a 14.6 years old girl with mixed type AIT.
AIT is not an uncommon complication in countries with low iodine intake. AIT can be asymptomatic and can occur at any time in patients receiving amiodarone therapy. It is also very important to distinguish the type of AIT when planning therapy. Steroid therapy should be started when findings indicate type II or mixed-type AIT. Beta blockers may prevent heart thyrotoxicosis and recurrence of primary arrhythmia if amiodarone is discontinued.

Abstract:  
Dronedarone is a multichannel blocker with similar electrophysiological properties to amiodarone. Dronedarone has not been studied in humans as an agent to suppress ventricular arrhythmias.
This case report describes the dramatic antiarrhythmic effects of dronedarone in a patient with nonischemic cardiomyopathy and recurrent ventricular tachycardia, which was resistant to multiple antiarrhythmic agents and endocardial catheter ablation.
Dronedarone was effective in completely suppressing ventricular tachycardia.
Further research is needed to establish a potential larger role for dronedarone in controlling ventricular arrhythmias in humans.

Abstract: Acquired long QT interval has been widely reported to be a consequence of drug therapy and electrolyte disturbances. We describe two cases of multifactorial acquired QT interval prolongation and torsades de pointes. In the first case, the drugs venlafaxine, amiodarone and domperidone may have contributed to QT interval prolongation in a patient with hypokalemia and hypomagnesaemia. In the second case, QT interval prolongation occurred in a patient taking quetiapine and citalopram, and whose use of hydrocholorothiazide and history of chronic alcohol abuse likely contributed by rendering the patient hypokalemic. These cases highlight the potential risks associated with polypharmacy and demonstrate that though torsades de pointes is an uncommon arrhythmia, the combination of multiple factors known to prolong QT interval may precipitate this life-threatening arrhythmia.

Abstract: Anti-arrhythmic drugs such as amiodarone have the potential to prolong QT intervals, which can result in torsades de point arrhythmia. It is unknown whether amiodarone, given to a recipient prior to cardiac transplantation, can cause arrhythmia in a newly transplanted donor heart. We report on a case of a 71-year-old male patient who had received intravenous and oral amiodarone prior to transplantation, which was associated with QT prolongation in the transplanted heart after re-exposure to the drug during subsequent episodes of ventricular fibrillation. An ICD was implanted, which has not been described that soon after cardiac transplantation. Amiodarone, given to a recipient, might cause QT prolongation in a donor heart after transplantation, possibly due to its long half-life and increased bioavailability caused by interaction with immunosuppressive drugs.

Abstract: Amiodarone, a benzofuranic iodine-rich antiarrhythmic drug, causes thyroid dysfunction in 15-20% of cases. Although amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism poses no particular problem, amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) is a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. There are two main forms of AIT: type 1, a form of iodine-induced hyperthyroidism, and type 2, a drug-induced destructive thyroiditis. However, mixed/indefinite forms exist that may be caused by both pathogenic mechanisms. Type 1 AIT usually occurs in abnormal thyroid glands, whereas type 2 AIT develops in apparently normal thyroid glands (or small goiters). Diagnosis of thyrotoxicosis is easy, based on the finding of increased free thyroid hormone concentrations and suppressed TSH levels. Thyroid radioactive iodine (RAI) uptake values are usually very low/suppressed in type 2 AIT, most commonly low or low-normal, but sometimes normal or increased in type 1 AIT despite the iodine load. Color flow Doppler sonography shows absent hypervascularity in type 2 and increased vascularity in type 1 AIT. Mixed/indefinite forms may have features of both AIT types. Thionamides represent the first-line treatment for type 1 AIT, but the iodine-replete gland is not very responsive; potassium perchlorate, by inhibiting thyroid iodine uptake, may increase the response to thionamides. Type 2 AIT is best treated by oral glucocorticoids. The response very much depends on the thyroid volume and the severity of thyrotoxicosis. Mixed/indefinite forms may require a combination of thionamides, potassium perchlorate, and steroids. RAI is usually not feasible in AIT due to low RAI uptake values. Thyroidectomy represents a valid option in cases resistant to medical therapy.

Abstract: To report the potential clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction between sirolimus and dronedarone.
A 67-year-old man status post-kidney transplant in 2004 was maintained on an immunosuppressive regimen consisting of sirolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and prednisone. He had been maintained for more than 1 year on a stable dose of sirolimus (5 mg/day), with concentrations ranging between 5 and 13.5 ng/mL. The patient was admitted to the hospital with a complaint of bloody diarrhea; shortly after admission, he developed atrial fibrillation for which dronedarone 400 mg twice daily was initiated. Sirolimus concentrations obtained 3 days after initiation of dronedarone revealed a trough concentration that was increased by more than 3-fold (38.6 ng/mL) from his baseline trough concentration. After sirolimus was held for 6 days, the trough concentration was 7.8 ng/mL. The dosage was reduced to 1 mg/day; there was no need for further adjustment.
While the potential for an interaction between sirolimus and dronedarone is listed in the package insert of dronedarone, there are no documented reports of this interaction in the peer-reviewed literature. Since sirolimus is a narrow therapeutic index medication, information about the severity and magnitude of the interaction with dronedarone may help clinicians avoid therapeutic misadventures when this combination is employed. Our case clearly demonstrates a significant pharmacokinetic interaction between sirolimus and dronedarone. The Horn Drug Interaction Probability Scale indicates that the occurrence of an interaction between sirolimus and dronedarone in our case is probable.
Due to the potential for sirolimus toxicity and excessive immunosuppression, the concurrent use of dronedarone and sirolimus should be avoided when possible. If concurrent administration cannot be avoided, we suggest close monitoring and a 50-75% dose reduction of sirolimus prior to dronedarone initiation.

Abstract: Thyroid nodules are common in the adult population. Widespread use of sensitive imaging studies often leads to their incidental discovery. Recent guidelines recommend thyroid-stimulating hormone determination and ultrasonography during initial nodule evaluation. Fine-needle aspiration is often performed to detect malignancy. However, the management of thyroid nodules in cardiac transplantation patients has not been directly addressed by recent guidelines. Confounding medications such as amiodarone and anti-coagulants present a management dilemma. The timing of fine-needle aspiration is crucial because (1) malignancy diagnosed pre-operatively usually precludes organ transplantation, and (2) patients undergoing solid-organ transplantation are at increased risk of developing de novo malignancies, including thyroid. With the rising incidence of thyroid cancer, donor-related malignancy will likely become a more prominent issue. This review addresses thyroid nodule management in the cardiac transplant population and provides recommendations for organ donation and transplantation in donors and recipients with thyroid cancer.

Abstract: To report a case of postnatal, postoperative amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism in an infant with a congenital heart defect.
Case report and literature review.
Pediatric intensive care unit at a freestanding tertiary care children's hospital.
At 7 wks of age, a female infant with a congenital heart defect was confirmed to have profound hypothyroidism after amiodarone administration for a postoperative cardiac arrhythmia.
Levothyroxine treatment.
Thyroid function tests were regularly performed to guide levothyroxine dosing. Thyroid hormone replacement was discontinued after the infant had been off amiodarone for 6 mos.
Given the potential adverse developmental consequences associated with hypothyroidism during infancy and early childhood, thyroid function tests should be carefully monitored in any infant treated with amiodarone.

Abstract: To compare and contrast the pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of new, emerging, and established antiarrhythmic and anticoagulant medications and describe nonpharmacologic interventions for the treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF).
Shortcomings of established antiarrhythmic agents include a risk for proarrhythmias and intolerable adverse effects. Dronedarone is a recently introduced amiodarone congener for maintenance of sinus rhythm after cardioversion in patients with AF that is better tolerated than amiodarone. Vernakalant is an emerging antiarrhythmic agent for conversion of AF to normal sinus rhythm with atrial-selective activity that appears to minimize the risk for proarrhythmia. An unpredictable dose-response relationship and the need for laboratory monitoring are among the many shortcomings of warfarin. Rivaroxaban, an emerging oral direct factor Xa inhibitor, and dabigatran, an emerging oral direct thrombin inhibitor, have predictable dose-response relationships and do not require laboratory monitoring. Additional data from comparative clinical trials will clarify the role of these emerging agents in the treatment of AF. Various nonpharmacologic interventions may be used for rhythm control, rate control, or cardioversion in patients whose AF cannot be managed with pharmacotherapy because of a lack of efficacy or intolerable adverse effects.
New and emerging antiarrhythmic and anticoagulant agents offer advantages over established agents and may improve outcomes in patients with AF.

Abstract: To discuss the therapeutic goals in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF); antithrombotic, rate-control, and rhythm-control medications used in these patients; rationale for choosing between rate-control and rhythm-control strategies; and safety, efficacy, and patient-specific considerations in choosing among established antiarrhythmic medications for these patients.
The three primary goals for patients with AF are prevention of thromboembolic stroke, heart rate control, and rhythm control. Warfarin is more effective than aspirin for stroke prevention in patients with AF, and it is recommended for patients at high risk for stroke. However, warfarin is underused, especially in elderly patients. Diltiazem, verapamil, beta-blockers, digoxin, and amiodarone may be used for rate control; the choice among these agents is based on the patient's blood pressure and the presence of certain underlying diseases. Rhythm-control strategies for patients with AF offer no advantage over rate-control strategies in terms of mortality or quality of life, and they are associated with a higher rate of hospitalization. Exercise tolerance is greater with rhythm control, however. The choice among antiarrhythmic agents for maintenance of sinus rhythm after cardioversion is based on safety, efficacy, and the presence of underlying structural heart disease (e.g., heart failure, coronary artery disease, hypertension with or without left ventricular hypertrophy) and renal impairment.
Careful consideration of patient-specific characteristics and the differences in safety and efficacy among antithrombotic, rate-control, and rhythm-control medications is needed to optimize treatment of and outcomes in patients with AF.

Abstract: Delirium related to levetiracetam has not been previously described in the literature and is infrequently associated with amiodarone.
The aim of this report was to discuss the possibility that administration of levetiracetam and amiodarone may precipitate delirium in some elderly patients.
An 80-year-old white woman with levothyroxine-treated hypothyroidism developed acute confusion and paranoia 5 days after substituting levetiracetam 1000 mg orally twice daily for phenytoin 100 mg orally twice daily to control new, generalized seizures. Before starting levetiracetam treatment, results of the patient's blood and urine tests, brain magnetic resonance imaging, and cerebrospinal fluid examination were within normal limits. Delirium from levetiracetam was suspected. Therefore, the dosage was titrated downward to allow discontinuation of the drug; levetiracetam was replaced with pregabalin 150 mg twice daily. Subsequent improvement in mental status occurred within 14 days after administration of the last dose of levetiracetam. Three months later, the patient developed symptomatic atrial fibrillation, which was treated with cardioversion, followed by oral amiodarone 400 mg twice daily for 10 days and then 200 mg once daily for 3 months. Within 1 to 2 weeks after starting amiodarone, she developed changes in cognition consistent with delirium. Computed tomography of the brain showed no acute changes, and blood test results were within normal limits with the exception of a serum free thyroxine level of 2.06 ng/dL and a suppressed but measurable serum thyroid-stimulating hormone level (0.13 microIU/mL). No improvement was noted after reduction of the dose of levothyroxine from 0.1 mg to 0.075 mg daily. Two weeks after amiodarone was discontinued, her mental status had returned to baseline levels. Based on a score of 6 (probable) for each medication using the Naranjo scale, the 2 episodes of delirium were probably related to levetiracetam and amiodarone.
This case report describes separate episodes of delirium probably related to treatment with levetiracetam and amiodarone in an elderly patient.

Abstract: The objective of this review is to explore and challenge the superiority of amiodarone for rate control in Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and concomitant atrial fibrillation (WPW-AF). The current recommendation for pharmacological treatment of this condition is amiodarone. A review of the past 25 years of literature finds several studies that identify a small risk of ventricular fibrillation secondary to amiodarone administration for rate control in WPW-AF. Additionally, the literature supports the safe and effective use of procainamide for rate control in WPW-AF. This review concludes that amiodarone is not superior to procainamide in rate control for WPW-AF, and may be dangerous.

Abstract: An "electrical storm" is a life-threatening condition defined as a recurrent attack of ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation. The current report is a case study of a patient who had electrical storms developing unexpectedly after undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. The electrical storms were terminated dramatically by the administration of nifekalant hydrochloride. We suggest that nifekalant hydrochloride has great therapeutic potential for the suppression of intractable ventricular tachyarrhythmias refractory to amiodarone.

Abstract: We reported a case of a child with neurodevelopment delay induced by long-term amiodarone exposure due to a treatment of fetal supraventricular tachycardia (FSVT), subtype permanent junctional reciprocating tachycardia (PJRT) with the normal thyroidal function. Refractory persistent FSVT was treated intrautero with digoxin (0.5 mg QD) until delivery and amiodarone (100 mg QD) from 26 to 35 weeks of gestation. A baby weighing 3550 g with normal acid-base status was delivered at 38 weeks of gestation. The PJRT recurred 28 hours after delivery and reverted to sinus rhythm with amiodarone and propranolol for another 24 months. The neurological disturbances were manifested at the age of 12 months, when hypotonia and delayed motor milestones were recognised. At the age of 18 months, the child had mildly neurological development delay with hypotonia, ataxia and foot deformities. At the age of 24 months, motor milestones were mildly delayed with the usage of a few words without the ability to connect them into the sentence. The developmental quotient (DQ) was 68. Electroencephalogram and magnetic resonance imaging of the central nervous system were all normal. At the age of 30 months, motor milestones were still delayed together with speech development and language delay, only some words were used, not distinctly, DQ was 78. Thyroid function was normal on each examination. All blood and urine analyses were in normal ranges. Chromosome analysis did not show any abnormalities. Since we excluded all possible reasons, we could only bring an indirect link between the long-term amiodarone exposure during fetal and postnatal life and neurodevelopment delay.

Abstract: Amiodarone pulmonary toxicity (APT) is a common and distinctive form of drug-induced lung injury. Several patterns have been described and the most common pattern of APT is interstitial pneumonitis. However, amiodarone-induced diffused alveolar haemorrhage is rarely reported. We describe a case of early onset of APT manifested by respiratory distress, haemoptysis, severe hypoxia and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates that was finally diagnosed with amiodarone-induced diffuse alveolar haemorrhage. High suspicion of APT in patients with these non-specific clinical symptoms is needed. Early recognition and treatment are imperative.

Abstract: A 74-year-old woman presented with a one-week history of persistent cough. A chest x-ray and computed tomography images revealed features mimicking lung cancer, which included a large solitary consolidation and hilar lymphadenopathy. She had received low-dose amiodarone (200 mg/day) for treatment of atrial fibrillation for more than 2.5 years. The tumour-like abnormalities did not disappear until the discontinuation of amiodarone therapy. The finding of low-dose amiodarone causing tumour-like abnormalities on a chest x-ray is unique. Once amiodarone-induced tumour-like changes are diagnosed, therapeutic options are limited. In most cases, the tumour-like changes are reversible, if diagnosed early. An unusual case involving amiodarone-induced pulmonary abnormalities is reported, followed by a review of the relevant literature.

Abstract: To highlight the possibility of development of thyroiditis after parathyroidectomy.
Clinical and laboratory findings in 2 cases are presented, and the relevant literature is reviewed.
In 2 women (84 years old and 55 years old) with no history of thyroid disease in one of them and a remote history of excision of a follicular adenoma in the other, thyrotoxicosis developed a few days to a week after parathyroidectomy for primary hyperparathyroidism. The first patient underwent bilateral cervical exploration with removal of a right inferior parathyroid adenoma, whereas the second patient had excision of 3 1/2 parathyroid glands for 4-gland hyperplasia and 2 benign nodules from the left thyroid lobe. Both surgical procedures were uncomplicated. Neither patient had received any iodinated contrast agents or medications such as lithium or amiodarone before presentation. Laboratory results showed elevated levels of free thyroxine, suppressed thyroid-stimulating hormone levels, very low radioiodine uptake (in the second patient), and an elevated thyroglobulin level (in the first patient). Both patients were treated symptomatically with beta-adrenergic antagonists. Thyroid function normalized and symptoms diminished after 1 to 2 months.
Parathyroidectomy-induced thyroiditis is underrecognized. The majority of patients are asymptomatic, although clinically significant thyrotoxicosis can also occur. Candidates for parathyroidectomy should be informed of this potential complication, and thyroid function should be assessed if clinically indicated.

Abstract: A case of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome with atrial fibrillation (AF) is reported in a patient who presented with syncope, tachycardia, and hypotension. The electrocardiogram (ECG) showed a fast irregular rhythm with wide polymorphic QRS tachycardia without the QRS twisting around the isoelectric baseline, diagnostic of AF and Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. The patient did not respond to intravenous amiodarone. Elective cardioversion restored sinus rhythm, and the ECG showed a wide QRS complex, short PR interval, and delta wave, indicating the presence of an accessory pathway and pre-excitation. AF was easily induced during the electrophysiologic study, requiring electrical cardioversion for severe hypotension. Successful radiofrequency ablation of the accessory pathway completely prevented further inducible AF. The patient no longer had any evidence of pre-excitation on ECG and remained symptom-free with no medications for 11 months.

Abstract: Amiodarone-induced hepatotoxicity consists of mild liver test abnormalities and rare cases of acute hepatitis and chronic hepatic lesions, and histologically resembles the whole spectrum of alcoholic liver disease, i.e., non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Amiodarone-induced neurotoxicity, including tremor, ataxia and peripheral neuropathy, is known, and some cases of parkinsonism following amiodarone use have also been reported.
To study the pathology of amiodarone-associated parkinsonism.
Light and electromicroscopic examinations of a patient with liver cirrhosis and amiodarone-induced parkinsonism.
On postmortem examination, the liver showed micronodular cirrhosis. Striking steatosis and frequent Mallory bodies were present on light microscopy. There were lysosomal inclusion bodies on electron microscopy. From these findings, amiodarone-induced liver cirrhosis was diagnosed. Brain atrophy and infarcts were not observed, and pigmentation in the substantia nigra was preserved. Histologically, there was a slightly lesser degree of neuronal loss with astrocytosis in the substantia nigra, locus ceruleus, and dorsal vagal nucleus. Lewy bodies were not found. In the cerebral white matter and basal ganglia, Alzheimer Type II astrocytes, which are abundant in hepatic encephalopathy, had deposition of electron-dense materials within the lysosomes and mitochondrial matrices. The materials were compatible with the accelerated amiodarone.
This is the first case in which the accumulation of amiodarone in the brain was morphologically observed. Amiodarone accumulation in the brain may play a role in neurotoxicity inducing parkinsonism.

Abstract: Ayurveda is an East Indian tradition involving the treatment of medical ailments through the use of herbal medications. A previously asymptomatic 62-year-old man with a history of hypertension and stable coronary artery disease developed paresthesias and fascicular and ventricular tachycardia after ingestion of an Ayurveda bowel regimen containing substrates from the Aconitum species, which is a known neurotoxin and cardiotoxin. Findings of electrophysiologic study and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging were within normal limits, pointing to the ingestion of Aconitum as the most likely source of his arrhythmia.

Abstract: Pleural effusion is an uncommon manifestation of amiodarone toxicity and is usually associated with amiodarone-induced interstitial pneumonitis. We describe a 70-year-old woman who came to the emergency department with bilateral pleuritic chest pain and malaise 4 weeks after her amiodarone dose was increased from 200 mg/day to 600 mg/day. She had bilateral exudative pleural effusions without associated pneumonitis. She was diagnosed with amiodarone-induced pleural effusions after a thorough workup during her hospitalization excluded other causes for the effusions. Due to intractable arrhythmias, the patient's amiodarone was not discontinued, and she was discharged home. Four days later at a follow-up visit at the pulmonary clinic, the patient complained of worsening chest pain as well as dyspnea and cough. A computed tomography scan showed left-sided pleural effusion with multiple loculations. She underwent a pulmonary vein isolation procedure, and amiodarone was discontinued. She was treated with prednisone 40 mg/day, tapered over the next 2 weeks. Three weeks after the amiodarone was stopped, the patient was asymptomatic, and a chest radiograph showed complete resolution of the effusions. Review of the patient's medical records revealed that she had experienced similar symptoms and exudative pleural effusions 2 years earlier after a similar dose escalation of amiodarone; the symptoms and pleural effusions resolved after the amiodarone dosage was reduced. Use of the Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale indicated that the association between the pleural effusions and amiodarone was highly probable (score of 9). This case report emphasizes that amiodarone should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with exudative effusions after a thorough workup has excluded other causes. Amiodarone should be replaced with alternative antiarrhythmic therapy if clinically feasible, and corticosteroids may be beneficial.

Abstract: Caffeine is a natural alkaloid methylxanthine that is found in various plants such as coffee or tea. Symptoms of a severe overdose may present with hypokalemia, hyponatremia, ventricular arrhythmias, hypertension followed by hypotension, respiratory failure, seizures, rhabdomyolysis, ventricular fibrillation and finally circulatory collapse. A 21-year-old woman called for the ambulance herself soon after the ingestion of about 10,000 mg of caffeine. At the arrival of the ambulance, the patient went into cardiac arrest almost immediately. After a total resuscitation period of 34 min including seven counter-shocks and 2 mg epinephrine, the patient was stable enough to be transferred to the hospital. The patient soon went into VF again and received two more counter-shocks and 1 mg epinephrine and finally an intravenous bolus dose of 300 mg amiodarone. The initial arterial blood gas showed pH at 6.47, lactate at 33 mmol/l and potassium level at 2.3 mmol/l. Unfortunately, no blood samples for caffeine analysis were taken. Three days after hospital admission, the patient developed myoclonus, which did not respond to medical treatment. Excessive intake of caffeine may produce arrhythmias and pronounced hypokalemia and ensuing ventricular fibrillation. In case of counter-shock-resistant VF, it can be necessary to give an early loading dose of amiodarone. Furthermore, it may be beneficial to replace the potassium as early as possible. Epinephrine and buffer solutions used during resuscitation may further decrease blood potassium levels and should be administrated cautiously. Epinephrine can be replaced by other vasopressor drugs, such as vasopressin without effects on beta-receptors.

Abstract: Bone marrow infiltration by granulomas rarely presents with cytopenias and is usually a result of atypical infections, lymphomas, or sarcoidosis. Drugs are also an important but often overlooked causal agent of bone marrow granulomas. Although rare, amiodarone has been associated with bone marrow granuloma formation. This case report describes a 73-year-old male who presented with pancytopenia during a preoperative evaluation. Amiodarone therapy was suspected to be the causal agent after diagnostic evaluation and exclusion of other causes. After cessation of amiodarone, the patient's pancytopenia gradually resolved over a period of several months. Our report illustrates an often overlooked yet important cause of reversible pancytopenia owing to suspected amiodarone-induced bone marrow granuloma formation, and guides clinicians in an expected timeline for blood count improvement after cessation of this drug.

Abstract: We report the first case with Eisenmenger syndrome secondary to an isolated perimembranous ventricular septal defect (VSD) in a patient who underwent bilateral lung transplantation and closure of the VSD in Japan. This male patient was diagnosed as having a VSD associated with severe pulmonary hypertension at the age of 7, and right unilateral pulmonary artery banding was performed at age 9. At 38 years of age, we performed bilateral cadaveric lung transplantation with patch closure of the VSD. Explant pathology revealed grade 3 for the right lung and grade 4 for the left lung by the Heath-Edwards classification. The ventricular contractility had gradually improved, and ventricular arrhythmia requiring amiodarone prior to lung transplantation had disappeared. When cardiac function is preserved, bilateral lung transplantation is an option for patients with Eisenmenger syndrome secondary to VSD and should be considered as an alternative to heart-lung transplantation, especially in Japan, where donor organ shortage is critical.

Abstract: Knowledge on ventricular tachycardia (VT) in isolated ventricular noncompaction (IVNC) is limited. We report on a patient with IVNC who presented with cardiogenic shock due to an incessant drug-resistant VT that was cured by radiofrequency ablation. The VT had characteristics of a deep septal focal arrhythmia, which was distinctive by ablation-induced alternation of the rightward and leftward exits, and was difficult to ablate from either side of the ventricular septum.

Abstract: The differential diagnosis of wide QRS tachycardia is a challenge for the emergency physician. The major tool is the electrocardiogram (ECG), even though the sensitivity and specificity may be variable, depending on presentation. Additional leads could be used to improve the diagnostic accuracy of the ECG.
To document the use of the Lewis lead in improving the diagnostic accuracy of the ECG in wide QRS tachycardia.
A 52-year-old woman with rheumatoid arthritis, in treatment with methotrexate, was admitted with progressive dyspnea that evolved to acute respiratory distress and shock at arrival. Pneumonia was diagnosed as the infection and she received antibiotics, and respiratory and inotropic support. She was also using amiodarone for more than 10 years, but she couldn't state the reason. On cardiac monitoring, wide QRS tachycardia was detected and ventricular tachycardia was considered on the differential diagnosis. The standard 12-lead ECG was complemented with the Lewis lead, obtained with higher speed and amplitude, demonstrating atrioventricular concordance and excluding ventricular tachycardia. The patient was treated for septic shock, and she died 2 days later.
The Lewis lead is a simple and easy strategy to enhance atrial activity detection in wide QRS tachycardia.

Abstract: Therapeutic hypothermia (TH) is used in neuroprotection following cardiac arrest due to ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF). Accidental hypothermia is itself known to cause prolongation of the corrected QT interval (QTc). QTc prolongation can cause polymorphic VT and VF. If this also occurs in TH, it may induce refibrillation. We investigated the effect of TH on the QTc interval.
Prospective case series of all patients undergoing TH following cardiac arrest following VT/VF at our hospital between July 2008 and January 2009. We studied the effect of temperature on QTc. All electrocardiograms (ECGs) undertaken during TH were studied and compared with the ECG prior to this. Four patients underwent TH. A total of 10 ECGs were undertaken during TH. The QTc was normal prior to TH. It became prolonged (>460 ms) in all cases during TH and normalized after cessation of TH, apart from Patient 4 who did not have an ECG post-TH since she died from cardiogenic shock. There was a negative correlation between temperature and QTc (Pearson's correlation coefficient, r= -0.71).
Our series illustrates QTc prolongation during TH. This carries potential for refibrillation. Guidelines on ECG monitoring during TH are needed, especially since hypothermic myocardium is intrinsically prone to arrhythmias and commonly used antiarrythmic drugs such as amiodarone can prolong the QTc.

Abstract: This is a case report in which a 60-year-old man who suffered from ventricular tachycardia with dilated cardiomyopathy was prescribed amiodarone. After taking amiodarone, liver enzymes were increased and computed tomographic (CT) scanning of the abdomen showed a significant increase in the density of the liver without contrast medium. He was suspected as hemochromatosis and liver biopsy was performed. An abnormal high density of liver tissue may be observed in an unenhanced CT in patients treated with amiodarone and we suggest that periodic monitoring of liver function and/or liver biopsy is warranted before an irreversible stage is reached.

Abstract: Intravenous amiodarone (AMD) induces multiple antiarrhythmic effects via blocking of Na(+), Ca(2+), and IKr channels, and beta receptors. A patient on chronic dialysis was administered AMD for nonsustained ventricular tachycardia after successful cardiopulmonary resuscitation. QT prolongation occurred 5 h after AMD administration. AMD was withdrawn at 24 h because of prolonged QTc interval (716 ms), which persisted for a further 48 h (661 ms). Ventricular premature contraction (VPC) was significantly decreased at 7h; however, VPC increased again after discontinuing AMD. Depolarization changes induced by the Na(+)-channel blocking action of AMD were analyzed. There was increasing filtered QRS-duration and duration of low-amplitude signals at voltage <40 µV, and decreasing root-mean-square voltage of signals in the last 40 ms of ventricular late potentials (LPs) within 7 h. However after stopping AMD, LPs were reversed. The blood concentration of AMD reached the effective level within 10 min but decreased immediately to an ineffective level. Onset and disappearance of the VPC-inhibiting effect corresponded to the depressive effect on depolarization but not with the increase in the prolonged repolarization effect and blood concentration. Even if the QT interval is sufficiently prolonged, the Na(+)-channel blocking action is required for AMD to induce the antiarrhythmic effect.

Abstract: Amiodarone is a highly effective antiarrhythmic drug. Its long-term use may, however, lead to several adverse effects, with pulmonary toxicity being the most serious. The article presents the case of a 78-year-old woman with a history of cardiac surgery, who after 2 years of amiodarone therapy for prophylactic treatment of atrial fibrillation developed amiodarone pneumonitis mimicking an acute pulmonary edema. The patient failed to respond to diuretic therapy and several courses of anti-infective therapy. Differential diagnosis of different causes of pulmonary infiltrates did not demonstrate any other abnormality. Lung biopsy findings were consistent with the diagnosis of amiodarone pneumonitis. Given the widespread use of amiodarone as an antiarrhythmic agent, pneumologists and cardiologists should consider this important adverse effect as a differential diagnosis of pulmonary distress refractory to therapy in all patients treated with amiodarone who present with respiratory symptoms and pneumonia-like illness.

Abstract: Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (MD1) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by myotonia, progressive muscular weakness, cataract, and cardiac involvement. Cardiac involvement is common and includes conduction system abnormalities, supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias, and less frequently, myocardial dysfunction and ischemic heart disease. A 54-year-old woman with a previous diagnosis of MD1 was admitted with palpitation, blood pressure of 157/118 mmHg, and a heart rate of 220 beats/min. Electrocardiography (ECG) showed ventricular tachycardia. Within minutes, hemodynamic collapse developed and electrical cardioversion was performed. Immediately following cardioversion, ECG showed atrial fibrillation, a slightly prolonged QT interval, and intraventricular conduction delay. After intravenous infusion of amiodarone, the rhythm converted to sinus. Transthoracic echocardiography showed significantly depressed left ventricular function, an ejection fraction of 25%, and normal coronary arteries. During electrophysiological study, atrium-His interval and His-ventricle interval were 120 msec was 54 msec, respectively, and monomorphic ventricular flutter was induced. An implantable cardioverter-defibrillator was placed. She was discharged in sinus rhythm.

Abstract: Sulpiride, a selective dopamine D2 antagonist and a substituted benzamide derivative, is considered a safe antipsychotic and antidepressant agent with few adverse effects on the cardiovascular system. Sulpiride-induced torsades de pointes is rare. We report a case of long QT syndrome and torsades de pointes induced by ingestion of 1.5 g of sulpiride. Ventricular arrhythmia was initially treated with amiodarone, without success. Eventually, lidocaine and magnesium sulfate successfully terminated the ventricular arrhythmia. The patient was discharged uneventfully after 3 days of hospitalization. This case illustrates the fact that acute sulpiride poisoning may lead to life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia. Early recognition followed by effective therapy is crucial. Intensive cardiac monitoring is recommended for sulpiride poisoning.

Abstract: Nonalcoholic steatosis/steatohepatitis is the most common cause for abnormal liver chemistries. Apart from metabolic syndrome, drugs may also lead to development of steatohepatitis that may, rarely, progress to cirrhosis and portal hypertension. We discuss a case of amiodarone-induced steatohepatitis with advanced fibrosis, presenting with hepatic decompensation and portal hypertension manifesting as ascites and recurrent esophageal variceal hemorrhage. Amiodarone is a lipophilic drug that concentrates in the liver and usually, over a period of time, leads to toxicity related to drug accumulation. There is marked histological similarity between amiodarone-induced liver disease and alcoholic and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. The clinical manifestations of amiodarone-induced hepatotoxicity and the mechanism of toxicity are also discussed.

Abstract: A 43-year-old woman reported pain in the right hypochondrium, which had started 3 years before and had been worsening for the past few days. Claudication in the superior and inferior limbs, diffuse myalgia, dyspnea, precordialgia followed by dizziness and visual turbidity were added to the clinical picture. In the physical examination bilateral carotid bruit was observed, abdominal aorta murmur and the decrease of the right radial and left pedis pulses and arterial hypertension with difference in the diastolic pressure between limbs >10 mmHg was also observed. On cardiac catheterisation with aortography, right coronary with proximal parietal irregularities, slight pressure increase in right chambers and pulmonary artery, preserved left ventricle contractility, competent valves, carotid and subclavian partial obstruction, severe narrowing of the abdominal aorta below the diaphragm (80%) and right renal artery significant stenosis were observed. Takayasu's arteritis (TA) diagnosis was established according to the ACR criteria based on the clinical symptomatology, on physical and image test findings. Two years later she presented malar rash, photosensitivity, nephropathy, leukopenia, lymphopenia and hemolytic anemia confirming the systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) diagnosis. TA coexisting with SLE has rarely been reported.

Abstract: A case of colchicine-induced rhabdomyolysis is reported. A 48 year old African-American male with history of hypertension and chronic gout on colchicine 0.6 mg daily presented with symptoms of a community acquired pneumonia. The patient was started on 500 mg of clarithromycin orally twice daily and represented to the emergency room after 3 days complaining of severe muscle pain. His liver panel showed elevations in the serum aminotransferases; AST 513 mU/ml (nl 15-41) and ALT 182 mU/ml (nl 17-63). His complete blood count showed an elevated white blood cell count of 18,800/ml (nl 4,000-10,000/ml). Urine analysis was positive for myoglobin with no red cells present. Serum creatine kinase (CK) was 22,996 mU/ml (nl 31-221) with a normal troponin I 0.18 (nl <0.4).Investigations confirmed the presence of rhabdomyolysis and discontinuation of colchicine and clarithromycin resulted in resolution of clinical and biochemical features of rhabdomyolysis. By hospital day four, his muscle soreness had improved markedly. His serum CK improved to 3,389 mU/ml (nl 31-221 mU/ml) and serum creatinine improved to 1.5 mg/dl (nl 0.8-1.2). On hospital day five, the patient was discharged on oral anti-hypertensive medication and a ten-day course of doxycycline. Metabolism of colchicine by the cytochrome P450 3A4 system has been previously described, but this is the first published report of colchicine associated rhabdomyolysis secondary to drug metabolism interactions with an antibiotic. A review of medications that are metabolized via the cytochrome 3A4 and A-SLAVED-LIVER (Amiodarone, Simvastatin, Lovastatin, Atorvastatin, Verapamil, Erythromycin, Diltiazem, cLarithromycin, Itraconazole, Voriconazole, colchicinE, Ritonavir) pneumonic was established.

Abstract: We describe the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation to temporize circulatory instability during almost incessant ventricular fibrillation in a patient with Brugada syndrome who had electively discontinued chronic amiodarone therapy. The extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was continued for 3 days after emergent delivery of the neonate, during which time the number of ventricular fibrillation episodes and internal defibrillations markedly decreased concomitant with administration of intravenous amiodarone and verapamil. Oral anti-arrhythmic therapy was subsequently reinstituted, and the remainder of the patient's hospital course was uneventful.

Abstract: Atrioventricular nodal re-entry tachycardia is the most common form of regular paroxysmal tachycardia in the adult population. This tachycardia is a re-entrant rhythm that uses the anatomic location of the atrioventricular node and its surrounding perinodal atrial tissue. The simplest concept regarding the atrioventricular nodal physiology that allows re-entry is founded upon the postulated existence of 2 atrioventricular nodal pathways with different conduction velocities and refractory periods. Herein, we present the case of a 64-year-old man who had a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation; he had a permanent pacemaker for sick-sinus syndrome. He developed a tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy with a perpetual dual response to the pacemaker stimulus. The tachycardia displayed characteristic dual atrioventricular-nodal physiology that was suppressed by amiodarone therapy, leading to a reversal of the cardiomyopathy. We discuss the mechanisms that surround such phenomena.

Abstract: Renal alterations in hypothyroidism include decreased glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow. We herein report a case of amiodarone -induced hypothyroidism associated with a rapid decrease of renal function, reversible upon amiodarone withdrawal. A 72-year-old man presented to our clinic in August 2007 reporting a recent deterioration of renal function. Ten weeks before he was admitted to another hospital for a supraventricular tachyarrhythmia treated with carvedilol 12.5 mg/day and amiodarone 400 mg/day. On admission, laboratory tests revealed altered renal function (serum creatinine 6 mg/dl, blood urea nitrogen 78 mg/dl) and severe hypothyroidism (free T4 0.27 pg/ml, free T3 1.49 pg/ml, TSH 183.36 mU/l). Amiodarone and carvedilol were stopped, while levothyroxine 75 mcg/die was started. After three months renal function had completely recovered to 1.9 mg/dl, BUN 28 mg/dl, with concurrent improvement of thyroid function free T4 14.2 pg/ml, free T3 6.4 pg/ml, TSH 15.5 mU/l.

Abstract: Amiodarone is used commonly in patients with cardiac diseases. Common side effects include thyroid dysfunction and hepatic abnormalities. However, recently there has been concern for developing liver cirrhosis secondary to amiodarone therapy. We present two cases of liver cirrhosis in patients taking amiodarone. Their clinical presentation as well as histological features are discussed in detail.

Abstract: To estimate the concurrent use between statins and amiodarone in context with published case reports of drug-interaction-induced rhabdomyolysis.
Retrospective analysis of a longitudinal prescription claims database for concurrent prescriptions of statins and amiodarone dispensed during 2006.
The study population includes an unprojected annual number of patients who filled a prescription for an HMG CoA reductase inhibitor or simvastatin-containing products or lovastatin-containing products or Lipitor (atorvastatin) or Caduet (amlodipine/atorvastatin) concurrently with brand and generic forms of amiodarone during 2006. The concurrency analysis was used to provide context for published case reports of rhabdomyolysis/myopathy related to simvastatin and amiodarone concurrent use.
Episodes of concurrent use between statins and amiodarone.
Findings from this analysis indicate noteworthy amiodarone and statin concurrency (44%) when based on amiodarone patient volume. Atorvastatin had the greatest level of concurrency (23.5%) with amiodarone followed by simvastatin (13.3%). Proportionality based on amiodarone patient volume shows a greater level of concurrency with 20 mg (6%) and 40 mg (5.5%) simvastatin strengths compared with other simvastatin strengths.
Clinicians should be vigilant in monitoring the regimens of patients prescribed a statin with drugs that may increase the risk of myopathy. In particular, since nearly half of the patients prescribed amiodarone may also be prescribed a statin, then addition of amiodarone or changes in statin dose should trigger a drug regimen review and patient level monitoring. Clinicians should avoid simvastatin doses greater than 20 mg per day in patients taking amiodarone.

Abstract: Early postoperative arrhythmias are a known complication of cardiac surgery. It is unusual, however, to encounter postoperative junctional and ectopic atrial tachycardias in the same patient. We describe our experience with a 2-year-old girl who suffered both these tachycardias after repair of a ventricular septal defect, the abnormal rhythms being controlled solely with intravenous administration of amiodarone.

Abstract: We report a long-term survival case of primary cardiac lymphoma with reversible ventricular tachycardia (VT) and complete atrioventricular block (C-AVB). A 65-year-old man with VT was treated by oral amiodarone administration. Later, a dual-chamber pacemaker was implanted because of C-AVB. Then, he was readmitted, as he complained of fever and chest pain. Echocardiography showed an enlarged cardiac mass and thus an open-chest biopsy was performed. He was then diagnosed with primary cardiac lymphoma. The chemotherapy and radiotherapy resulted in the disappearance of the mass. Complete remission has been maintained for 8 years after the therapy, and no VT or C-AVB has been detected.

Abstract: While electrocardiogram (ECG) changes are common during viral dengue infection, atrial fibrillation (AF) is a very rare manifestation. It has previously been highlighted that cardiac complications during dengue infection are invariably transient and will spontaneously resolve following recovery from the illness. We present the case of a young patient with IgM- and IgG-positive dengue hemorrhagic fever complicated by AF. ECG revealed a structurally normal heart. The patient remained in AF despite resolution of the illness. Reversion to normal sinus rhythm was achieved after loading of oral amiodarone.

Abstract: Intravenous administration of amiodarone has recently been recommended for use during pediatric resuscitation of pediatric patients with ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia. We present two pediatric patients who received amiodarone for polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, although they were ultimately determined to have congenital long QT syndrome. Amiodarone is contraindicated in this setting and may have exacerbated the ventricular arrhythmia.

Abstract: Amiodarone is generally regarded to have a high safety profile with a low incidence of arrhythmias. However, there have been reports of torsades de pointes under certain conditions, such as electrolyte imbalance or concomitant antiarrhythmic therapy. We describe a case of amiodarone-induced torsade de pointes early after initiation of intravenous amiodarone in the setting of T-wave alternans.

Abstract: In the Americas, approximately 20 million people suffer from the chronic phases of Chagas' disease, of which chagasic cardiomyopathy is the most important clinical feature. The elimination of Trypanosoma cruzi is a pivotal step in arresting the evolution of the disease. Unfortunately, currently available chemotherapy is mostly ineffective due to its limited efficacy and toxic side effects. The following case highlights the efficacy of new diagnostic and follow-up methods in the evaluation of novel trypanocidal compounds such as amiodarone and itraconazole.

Abstract: A dog that was referred to the University of Florida Veterinary Medical Center was discovered to have a bamboo skewer within the right atrium and right ventricle, traversing the tricuspid valve. The skewer was ingested approximately four months prior to referral and was partially removed via gastrotomy. The presenting complaint at the time of referral included coagulopathy, anemia and leukocytosis. A linear, hyperechoic structure was identified in the right heart during an echocardiogram. The foreign body was suspected to be a portion of the skewer that the patient had previously ingested. Cardiopulmonary bypass was performed and the foreign body was removed successfully. Complications following surgery included the development of tricuspid valve and ventricular wall thrombi, atrial flutter and amiodarone toxicity. Many indications have been described in the veterinary literature for cardiopulmonary bypass. However, to the best of the authors' knowledge, successful removal of an intracardiac foreign body with cardiopulmonary bypass has not been reported in a veterinary patient. This represents a new indication for cardiopulmonary bypass in veterinary medicine.

Abstract: In this article, we describe a case of a man without diabetes with a long history of amiodarone use. He presented with a foot deformity and plantar ulceration. Examination showed him to have a symmetrical peripheral neuropathy and findings consistent with a Charcot foot. Extensive investigations failed to find other causes for his neuropathy, other than his amiodarone use. We believe that this is the first reported case of a neuropathic foot deformity and ulceration occurring with amiodarone use, and we feel that it is important to point out the association of this commonly used antiarrythmic drug with this form of neuropathic osteoarthropathy.

Abstract: A male newborn weighing 2334 g was delivered at 37 weeks of gestation by caesarean section because of prenatal ultrasound findings of fetal hydrops with atrioventricualr block, ventriucular tachycardia (VT), and impaired ventricular function. In spite of the intravenous administration of lidocaine, VT continued. He developed poor perfusion and systemic hypotension. After the intravenous administration of amiodarone, VT was terminated. The electrocardiogram revealed an extremely prolonged corrected QT interval (860 ms) with 2:1 atrioventricular block. Unfortunately, he died 18 h after birth in spite of the administration of lidocaine, beta-blocker and magnesium. Mutational analysis identified a novel heterozygous de novo mutation (F1486del) in SCN5A. This mutation is associated with the IFM motif in the linker between III and IV domains of Na(v)1.5, which serves as an inactivation particle binding within the pore of sodium channels. This report demonstrates an interesting relationship between the clinical phenotype and the location of the mutation in long QT syndrome.

Abstract: Taxus species are known to be toxic and may result in significant dysrhythmias. Treatment of taxus induced cardiac dysrhythmias is based largely on case reports. We describe a case of a 24-year-old male with Taxus cuspidate (yew berry) toxicity initially treated with amiodarone bolus and infusion and subsequently managed with sodium bicarbonate boluses and continuous infusion.
The patient was found at home by his parents with witnessed "seizure-like"activity 2 hours after reportedly chewing and swallowing 168 yew seeds. The initial prehospital rhythm strip demonstrated ventricular tachycardia (VT); the patient was hypotensive with fluctuating levels of alertness. Prehospital cardioversion was attempted without success. Staff at the local presenting emergency department (ED) consulted toxicology for management of the presumed yew berry ingestion, complicated by cardiac dysrhythmias and mental status change with seizure. Amiodarone 300-mg IV and diazepam 5-mg IV were given. Cardioversion was attempted 4 times without change in the wide complex tachycardia, presumed to be VT, at a rate of 166. An amiodarone drip at 1 mg/min was initiated. The patient was transferred to an intensive care unit (ICU) at a regional toxicology center. On arrival to the toxicology center the patient was alert and verbally appropriate without complaints. Initial heart rate was 76 and regular with premature ventricular contractions (PVCs). A wide complex tachycardia associated with hypotension recurred; however, normal mental status was maintained. A bolus of 100 mEq of sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) was given intravenously followed by sodium bicarbonate infusion at 37.5 mEq/hr. The amiodarone drip was discontinued. Subsequent electrocardiograms (EKG's) revealed a prolonged, but steadily narrowing QRS complex. Ultimately, the QRS complex closed to 92 ms, with a rate of 94, PR 154 and a QT/QTc of 390/487.
This case describes successful treatment of an isolated Taxus cuspidate (yew berry) ingestion with significant toxicity initially with amiodarone bolus and infusion. Due to lack of significant change in telemetry recordings with amiodarone, treatment with sodium bicarbonate bolus and infusion was initiated. While the QRS narrowed significantly temporally related to the bicarbonate, it is difficult to determine if correction of the cardiac dysrhythmias was solely due to the sodium bicarbonate, or the synergism of sodium bicarbonate and amiodarone, or possibly spontaneous improvement due to taxine clearance. One should use caution while drawing conclusions from a single case; however, based on the clinical improvement of this patient, both with EKG recordings and vital signs, this report would suggest that isolated Taxus cuspidate ingestion from yew berry plants can be treated with sodium bicarbonate.

Abstract: Ultrasound examination of a fetus at 32 weeks' gestation revealed dilated cardiomyopathy and a heart rate of 170 beats per minute. Prenatally, this mild tachycardia was not primarily suspected to be the cause of the myocardial changes. Postnatal electrocardiography revealed a persistent junctional reciprocating tachycardia (PJRT) and the diagnosis of tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy (TICM) became apparent. After conversion to a sinus rhythm under digoxin and amiodarone, the cardiac changes regressed. PJRT is a rare form of supraventricular tachycardia. The prenatal findings in the condition have previously been described retrospectively, but it can only be diagnosed postnatally by its characteristic electrocardiographic properties. This case indicates that TICM can occur at lower heart rates than previously assumed. Even severe prenatal cardiomyopathy may be reversible once sinus rhythm has been restored.

Abstract: We report one case of cardiac arrest related to ciprofloxacin administration. One female patient (aged 70 years old) developed a marked QTc prolongation (QTc = 0.62 s) within 24 hours of ciprofloxacin administration, with documented torsades de pointes and recurrent syncope that required defibrillation. The patient was under amiodarone and sotalol therapy for atrial fibrillation, with no obvious QT prolongation prior to ciprofloxacin therapy. QT prolongation and subsequent torsades de pointes appeared only after initiation of ciprofloxacin and normalized after drug discontinuation. Even though ciprofloxacin is thought to be safer than other agents in its class, it may cause QT prolongation and torsades de pointes, particularly in high risk patients with predisposing factors. Prolongation of the QT interval related to the effect of fluoroquinolones on rapid potassium channels (IKr) may result on potentially serious proarrhythmic effect, leading to torsades de pointes.

Abstract: The subarachnoid administration of morphine is a well-established anesthetic technique of postoperative analgesia due to its efficacy safety and low cost. The objective of this paper was to report the accidental subarachnoid administration of 4 mg of morphine complicated by atrial fibrillation after administration of naloxone.
A 45-year old male patient with 75 kg, 1.72 m, physical status ASA II, hypertensive, was scheduled for reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament of the left knee. After spinal anesthesia, it was noticed that the vial of morphine had been changed resulting in the accidental subarachnoid administration of 4 mg of morphine (0.4 mL of the 10 mg vial). Respiratory rate varied from 12 to 16 bpm and the patient remained hemodynamically stable without intraoperative complaints. Thirty minutes after admission to the post-anesthesia recovery unit the patient developed vomiting and diaphoresis being treated with 0.4 mg of naloxone followed by continuous infusion of 0.2 mg x (-1) until the symptoms had subsided. Continuous naloxone infusion was maintained in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), where blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate and oxygen saturation were monitored as well as the presence of nausea, pruritus, vomiting, sedation, pain and urinary retention. Two hours after arriving at the ICU the patient developed acute atrial fibrillation without hemodynamic instability. Sinus rhythm was reestablished after the administration of 150 mg of amiodarone and discontinuation of the naloxone infusion. During the following 18 hours the patient remained hemodynamically stable and did not experience any other intercurrence until his discharge from the hospital.
The present report is an alert for the risk of inadvertently switching of drugs during anesthesia, stressing the importance of referring patients being treated for opiate overdose to the ICU, due to the potential adverse reactions.

Abstract: Accidental intravascular administration of bupivacaine during performance of a brachial block precipitated convulsions followed by asystole. The patient was rapidly resuscitated using cardiopulmonary resuscitation, supplemented by 150 mL of 20% lipid emulsion. Nonetheless, cardiac toxicity reappeared 40 min after completion of the lipid emulsion. In the absence of further lipid emulsion, amiodarone and inotropic support were used to treat cardiotoxicity. This case suggests that local anesthetic systemic toxicity may recur after initial lipid rescue. Since recurrence of toxicity may necessitate administration of additional doses of lipid emulsion, a sufficient quantity of lipid emulsion should be available when regional anesthesia is performed.

Abstract: A case of amiodarone-induced neurotoxicity is reported.
A 76-year-old man arrived at the emergency department with complaints of increasing imbalance over the past 2.5 months after a recent discharge from the hospital. He reported that his balance had worsened over the past week and that he now must use a cane to walk. His medical history included coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Home medications included enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg orally daily, isosorbide dinitrate 20 mg orally twice daily, amiodarone hydrochloride 400 mg orally three times daily, hydralazine hydrochloride 10 mg orally four times daily, extended-release metoprolol succinate 142.5 mg (equivalent to metoprolol tartrate 150 mg) orally daily, simvastatin 80 mg orally daily, and warfarin sodium 2.5 mg orally daily. Physical examination of the patient revealed finger-to-nose dysmetria, unsteady gait with leftward prevalence, positive Romberg's sign, and inability to perform heel-to-toe walk. All radiographic imaging studies and laboratory test values ruled out acute pathologies, bleeding, masses, and ischemia. As there were no physiological findings for the patient's symptoms and after careful evaluation of the patient's drug regimen, the patient's amiodarone was discontinued. His ataxia began to slowly improve. All neurologic symptoms resolved completely five months after discontinuation of amiodarone.
A 76-year-old man developed ataxia after taking amiodarone hydrochloride 400 mg orally three times daily for more than two months; the regimen was the intended loading dosage. The ataxia lessened over the first two weeks after the amiodarone was discontinued and resolved completely within five months after drug discontinuation.

Abstract: Atrial thrombosis is a relatively rare event in children. We report a case of a newborn with AFI who after restoration of sinus rhythm, developed atrial thrombus on a prominent Chiari network floating between the right and left atrium through the patent foramen ovale. The thrombus was resolved following treatment with heparin without events.
Atrial stunning was proposed as a key mechanistic phenomenon because the thrombus occurred after the cardioversion of AFI to sinus rhythm. Heparin may be effective in the resolution of atrial thrombus within a few days.

Abstract: Amiodarone is an effective antiarrhythmic agent and represents the drug of choice in the treatment of severe arrhythmias, especially in the setting of ventricular dysfunction. Amiodarone has the potential for interaction with many cardiac and non-cardiac drugs. Nonetheless few incompatibilities have been reported. We report the incompatibility between amiodarone and heparin administrated in the same vein in a case of a one month old baby with atrial flutter. This topic needs more attention, due to the frequent co-administration of these two drugs in tachyarrhythmias with high thromboembolic risk.

Abstract: Postoperative atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common complication after cardiothoracic surgery, not only associated with an increased length of hospital stay but also predisposing patients to thromboembolic complications and stroke. Current guidelines advocate a therapeutic approach for postoperative AF that is fairly similar to the recommendations given for nonsurgical patients who develop AF. With respect to anticoagulation, heparin or oral anticoagulation is generally considered appropriate when the arrhythmia persists > 48 hours. The authors present the case of a patient developing sudden-onset, highly symptomatic AF 9 days after open-heart surgery, requiring pharmacologic treatment with amiodarone and metoprolol. Despite an early conversion to sinus rhythm, the patient subsequently developed a stroke, which echocardiographically was attributed to a highly mobile thrombus in the left atrial appendage. Surprisingly, good left atrial mechanical activity was observed. This raises the question of whether the early restoration of sinus rhythm without anticoagulation is safe in a postoperative setting.

Abstract: Amiodarone is a class III antiarrhythmic agent with a long half-life which is used to control atrial and ventricular arrhythmias, including atrial flutter and fibrillation. We describe here the case of an elderly woman (77 years of age) who was hospitalized for acute atrial fibrillation, abdominal pain, and dyspnea. In the Emergency Department, treatment with intravenous amiodarone was begun. The following day, the patient developed acute liver damage; improved liver function occurred following the withdrawal of amiodarone. Complete recovery of liver function was documented after three weeks. Unfortunately, the patient died from a severe infectious disease, with multiple organ failure.

Abstract: A 74-year-old man presented with left ventricular failure and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. Coronary angiography revealed normal coronary arteries; left ventriculography showed hypokinesis of the lateral wall segment. The ejection fraction was 54%. Cine-magnetic resonance imaging showed a double-layered appearance on four-chamber view and marked trabeculations as well as intratrabecular recesses in the inferolateral segments on short-axis view, findings consistent with isolated noncompaction of the ventricular myocardium (INVM). Contrast-enhanced imaging revealed hypoperfusion and delayed enhancement of the endomyocardium in the inferolateral segments. Subendomyocardial perfusion abnormality and necrosis may constitute the diagnostic criteria of INVM.

Abstract: A 40-year-old woman was referred to intensive care unit after recurrent ventricular fibrillation. She was free of cardiac medical history or medications. The resting ECG displayed an extended early repolarization in the inferior leads and all the precordial leads. Incessant ventricular fibrillations justified a treatment by intravenous amiodarone associated with general anaesthesia and mechanical ventilation without success on ventricular fibrillation. Because of a low heart rate intravenous isoproterenol infusion was initiated. Isoproterenol infusion was associated with heart rate acceleration and a decrease in J point elevation and the disappearance of ventricular fibrillation episodes. No cardiac disease was documented and the patient was implanted of a single chamber ICD. Six months later the patient was free of syncope and ventricular fibrillation on ICD memory. This case report demonstrates the usefulness and efficiency of the isoproterenol infusion to eliminate recurrent ventricular fibrillation in patients with early repolarization.

Abstract: A new distinct clinical syndrome comprising of ventricular tachycardia or frequent premature beats arising from the base of the posterior papillary muscle has recently been reported. The cardiac arrhythmia had a non-reentrant mechanism and none of the patients had left ventricular dysfunction.
We report on a 55-year-old female patient presenting with a dilated cardiomyopathy and frequent ventricular premature beats (VPB). Ventricular arrhythmia was refractory to amiodarone. Eighteen months after the onset of palpitations the patient evolved from NYHA functional class I to class III, with a LVEF of 38%. VPB comprised 26% of the total number of QRS complexes during 24 h Holter monitoring, which also recorded 12 salvos of non-sustained VT. NT-pro BNP level was 1,080 mcg/ml. During electrophysiologic study LV geometry was reconstructed with Ensite NAVX system which allowed voltage and activation mapping. We found neither scar-like nor low-voltage tissue in the endocardial surface of the LV. VPB was mapped in a site at the base of the posterior papillary muscle, which was confirmed by LV angiography. Cool-tip catheter ablation successfully eliminated VPB. Three months later, the patient was in NYHA functional class I, NT-proBNP level was 98 mcg/ml, with partial LV reverse remodeling and LVEF of 58%. Twenty-four hours Holter monitoring showed only 24 single premature beats.
Focal ventricular arrhythmia arising from the base of the left posterior papillary muscle can provoke significant left ventricular dysfunction. Left ventricular dysfunction reversed after elimination of the VPB.

Abstract: Although pulmonary toxicity from sirolimus is well recognized, the biochemically homologous everolimus has until recently been thought to be free from this side effect. Emerging evidence suggests an association between high-dose everolimus and symptomatic pneumonitis. Toxicity at typical immunosuppressive doses has also been described. In support of these observations, we report the occurrence of clinical pneumonitis in 3 patients in association with everolimus therapy after heart transplantation in the absence of other causative factors. Typical onset consisted of dyspnea, hypoxemia, and bilateral diffuse pulmonary infiltrates beginning between 2 weeks and 6 months after commencement of the drug. Although uncommon, everolimus may cause pneumonitis and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of pulmonary infiltrates and hypoxemia in an appropriate clinical setting.

Abstract: Early repolarization in the inferolateral leads has been recently recognized as a frequent syndrome associated with idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (VF). We report the case of a patient presenting dramatic changes in the ECG in association with recurrent VF in whom a novel genetic variant has been identified.
This young female (14 years) was resuscitated in 2001 following an episode of sudden death due to VF. All examinations including coronary angiogram with ergonovine injection, MRI, and flecainide or isoproterenol infusion were normal. The patient had multiple (>100) recurrences of VF unresponsive to beta-blockers, lidocaine/mexiletine, verapamil, and amiodarone. Recurrences of VF were associated with massive accentuation of the early repolarization pattern at times mimicking acute myocardial ischemia. Coronary angiography during an episode with 1.2 mV J/ST elevation was normal. Isoproterenol infusion acutely suppressed electrical storms, while quinidine eliminated all recurrences of VF and restored a normal ECG over a follow-up of 65 months. Genomic DNA sequencing of K(ATP) channel genes showed missense variant in exon 3 (NC_000012) of the KCNJ8 gene, a subunit of the K(ATP) channel, conferring predisposition to dramatic repolarization changes and ventricular vulnerability.

Abstract: To report on adverse reactions associated with amiodarone and propylthiouracil.
A 64-year-old female with atrial fibrillation and nodular goiter progressed to overt thyrotoxicosis after receiving therapy with amiodarone 200 mg/day for less than 12 weeks. Thyroid scan revealed a hyperfunctioning nodule in the left lobe, while immunologic studies were negative for both thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin antibodies. The thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) receptor antibody level was transiently elevated. Propylthiouracil 100 mg 3 times/day was started after the withdrawal of amiodarone, but the patient developed severe generalized skin rash, fever, and leukocytosis after 4 weeks. Thyroidectomy was performed, and histopathology was compatible with type 1 amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) associated with toxic nodular goiter. An objective causality assessment revealed that thyrotoxicosis was probably related to use of amiodarone.
Amiodarone is an antiarrhythmic agent that may cause thyroid dysfunction. Differentiating between the 2 types of AIT is important for implementation of the correct therapeutic strategy. The transient elevation of TSH receptor antibodies in AIT complicated the diagnosis. As a rare subtype, type 1 AIT by nodular goiter may be associated with early AIT. Initiating thyroid function monitoring within 3 months of amiodarone therapy should be considered.
Type 1 AIT caused by nodular goiter is rarely reported. Amiodarone should be avoided in such patients and subtotal thyroidectomy to remove the toxic nodule may be the treatment of choice.

Abstract: We describe the effects of iopanoic acid on daily levels of free triiodothyronine (FT(3)) and free thyroxine (FT(4)) in a patient with progressive type II amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) who was undergoing thyroidectomy. The patient was a 59-year-old man who was undergoing amiodarone therapy while awaiting cardiac transplantation; the use of beta blockers and corticosteroids to control the AIT was contraindicated in this patient. Prior to thyroidectomy, the patient was started on iopanoic acid at 1.0 g twice a day; in response to gastrointestinal side effects, the dosage was subsequently reduced to 0.5 g twice a day. The patient responded to iopanoic acid with a rapid decrease in his FT(3) level and slight increase in his FT(4) level. This control of thyrotoxicosis allowed for an uneventful thyroidectomy, which was later followed by successful cardiac transplantation. Based on our findings in this single case, we believe that iopanoic can be used to rapidly lower FT(3) levels and to treat symptoms of thyrotoxicosis in a preoperative setting. We also discuss the different pharmacodynamic effects that iopanoic acid has on FT(3) and FT(4) levels.

Abstract: We present a patient with a rare combination of amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis and Eisenmenger's syndrome.
Case report and review of the world literature regarding the morbidity and mortality of surgical management of amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis and the potential hazards of non-cardiac surgery in patients with Eisenmenger's syndrome.
Failure of maximal medical therapy necessitated surgical management to treat amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis which, in this particular patient, carried significant risks. Total thyroidectomy was performed leading to rapid resolution of thyrotoxicosis, and the patient made an uncomplicated recovery. We present this case because of its rarity and the potentially hazardous nature of surgical intervention in patients with Eisenmenger's syndrome. The pathogenesis of amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis and the differing approaches of medical and surgical management are discussed.
Based on our findings, we propose that surgical management should be considered earlier in the treatment algorithm (or possibly as first-line therapy) for amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis.

Abstract: A 19-year-old woman was brought by ambulance to the emergency department (ED) from a police holding cell. Less than 3 hours earlier, the patient had been a passenger in a car stopped for a traffic violation. As the police officer approached the car, the patient was noted to hurriedly stuff 2 plastic bags containing a white powdery substance into her mouth. On questioning, it was reported that the packets contained cocaine. Less than an hour after being taken to the police station, the patient was witnessed to have a generalized seizure. What is the pharmacological basis of acute cocaine intoxication? What are the cardiovascular manifestations of acute cocaine intoxication? What is the basis for using sodium bicarbonate in cocaine-induced wide-complex dysrhythmias? What is the basis for the use of lidocaine in cocaine-induced wide-complex dysrhythmias? Is there any evidence for the use of amiodarone to treat cocaine-induced wide-complex dysrhythmias?

Abstract: The overall incidence of amiodarone-induced thyroid dysfunction ranges from 2% to 24%. One third to half of patients with hypothyroidism have anemia due to some decrease in normal red blood cell mass and erythropoietin (EPO) resistance. Therefore, for patients with chronic renal disease under medication with amiodarone, early regular thyroid function test should be checked in order to avoid amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism and EPO-resistant anemia. If amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism and EPO-resistant anemia occur in patients with chronic renal failure, early thyroxine should be given instead of waiting for spontaneous recovery by amiodarone discontinuation only. Here, we report a patient with chronic renal failure who developed EPO-resistant anemia after amiodarone treatment for arrhythmia. The hemoglobin level responded to EPO therapy rapidly after thyroxine administration and amiodarone discontinuation.

Abstract: Amiodarone is a highly effective antiarrhythmic agent used in life-threatening ventricular and supraventricular arrhythmias. Its long-term use may however lead to several adverse effects, including corneal deposits, liver and thyroid gland dysfunction, lung lesions, bone marrow injury, skin lesions, or neurological abnormalities. The article presents the case of a 56-year-old man with a history of a stroke, who after a few days of amiodarone therapy for an episode of atrial fibrillation was diagnosed with amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism and interstitial pulmonary lesions. Clinical and laboratory symptoms of hyperthyroidism and radiographic signs of pulmonary involvement did not occur until several weeks after discontinuation of amiodarone therapy. Differential diagnosis of causes of hyperthyroidism and diseases causing nodular pulmonary lesions did not demonstrate any other pathologies. Empirical antibiotic therapy and administration of thiamazole and high doses of propranolol failed to improve the patient's clinical status. It was not until thiamazole was given in combination with glucocorticosteroids, when a slow relief of hyperthyroidism symptoms and resolution of radiographic pulmonary signs were observed. Based on the presented case, the risk of appearance of 2 serious concomitant adverse effects was demonstrated, even following a short-term amiodarone therapy. This paper also contains an overview of adverse effects which may be encountered during or after therapy with this effective antiarrhythmic agent. It was emphasized how important it is to select patients appropriately, and to monitor potential adverse effects during amiodarone therapy.

Abstract: Amiodarone is an antiarrhythmic benzoflurane drug with an imposing adverse effect profile. Amiodarone pulmonary toxicity is the major complication. It is well described in adults, whereas it is extremely rare in pediatric patients. This is a case of a child with supraventricular tachycardia post repair of transposition of the great vessels who developed amiodarone toxicity.

Abstract: The occurrence of mixed infections of Trypanosoma cruzi and Leishmania spp. is becoming a common feature in Central and South America due to overlapping endemic areas. Unfortunately, the possibilities for treating flagellated kinetoplastid infections are still very limited and most of the available drugs exhibit severe side effects. Although the development of new drugs for Leishmania has markedly improved in the last years, the tendency is still to employ antimonial compounds. On the other hand, treatment for Chagas' disease is only available for the acute phase with no effective therapeutical options for chronic stage disease. The following case report substantiates the recently discovered effect of amiodarone as a nonconventional antiparasitic drug, particularly against Leishmania, breaching a new perspective in the therapeutic management of these important infectious parasitic diseases.

Abstract: Cardiac arrhythmias associated with thyrotoxicosis tend to be supraventricular in nature with atrial fibrillation being the most common. Ventricular arrhythmias are rarely associated with thyrotoxicosis and are considered to be secondary to intrinsic cardiac disease.
We present three patients with thyrotoxicosis and stable coronary disease in whom the primary cardiac rhythm disturbance was ventricular tachycardia. In all of these patients, the ventricular arrhythmias terminated with achievement of a euthyroid state. We hypothesize that the thyrotoxic state contributed to the etiology of, or lowered the threshold for the ventricular arrhythmias.
Prompt attention to the management of thyrotoxicosis in patients with a history of significant heart disease is warranted in order to avoid potentially fatal arrhythmias.

Abstract: Presented is a case study of a seventy five year old man who experienced psychosis and depression related to the onset and termination of amiodarone therapy. The study looks at the pharmacology of amiodarone and the mechanisms that may have led to the emergence of these symptoms. It also raises the issue of making a careful assessment of a patient's life event history in that life events that may not be classically regarded as significant life events may be important in the precipitation of mental illness.

Abstract: Amiodarone is an anti-arrhythmic drug for life-threatening tachycardia, but various adverse effects have been reported. Reported herein is an autopsy case of valvular heart disease, in a patient who developed a lung mass (1.5 cm in diameter) and proteinuria (2.76 g/day) after treatment with amiodarone for a long time. The lung mass was highly suspected to be lung cancer on CT and positron emission tomography, but histologically the lesion was composed of lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates in alveolar walls and intra-alveolar accumulation of foamy macrophages containing characteristic myelinoid bodies, indicating that it was an amiodarone-related lesion. In addition, the lung tissue had unevenly distributed hemosiderin deposition, and abnormally tortuous capillaries were seen in the mass and in heavily hemosiderotic lung portions outside the mass. In the kidneys, glomeruli had membrane spikes, prominent swelling of podocytes and subepithelial deposits, which were sometimes large and hump-like. Autoimmune diseases, viral hepatitis, malignant neoplasms or other diseases with a known relationship to membranous glomerulonephritis were not found. The present case highlights the possibility that differential diagnosis between an amiodarone-related pulmonary lesion and a neoplasm can be very difficult radiologically, and suggests that membranous glomerulonephritis might be another possible complication of amiodarone treatment.

Abstract: A best evidence topic in cardiac surgery was written according to a structured protocol. The question addressed was whether the administration of amiodarone or lidocaine in patients with refractory VT/VF after cardiac surgery results in successful cardioversion. Altogether more than 434 papers were found using the reported search, from which 23 articles were used to answer the clinical question. No randomized trials have been found in which amiodarone was studied in patients with refractory VF/VT after cardiac surgery. Recommendations on the use of amiodarone in patients with refractory VF/VT in both European and American 2005 Guidelines on Resuscitation are mainly based on expert consensus and are supported by a few randomized trials in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. We would therefore recommend that amiodarone is the first line drug that should be used in patients with refractory ventricular arrhythmias after cardiac surgery that persist after three failed attempts at cardioversion. Lidocaine should only be used if amiodarone is not available or if its use is contraindicated. Amiodarone should be administered as an intravenous bolus of 300 mg after the third unsuccessful shock.

Abstract: Atrial fibrillation occurs frequently after lung transplantation and is commonly treated with amiodarone. Pulmonary toxicity may result from amiodarone exposure and is characterized by non-specific respiratory manifestations. To our knowledge, there are no reports of this complication occurring after lung transplantation. We present a patient who developed radiologic evidence of amiodarone deposition in the lungs after bilateral lung transplantation.

Abstract: Amiodarone is commonly used in the treatment of refractory paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Much of the literature focuses on the toxic effects of this medication in the setting of rapid loading or long-term therapy with high maintenance doses. However, patients have been known to develop multi-organ toxicities with long-term low-dose therapy.
We present a 90-year-old man with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation undergoing low-dose amiodarone therapy for a period of 18 months without medical follow-up who developed signs and symptoms consistent with neurotoxicity and hepatotoxicity in association with hyperammonemia. Upon discontinuation of the medication and treatment of the hyperammonemia, the patient had a rapid decline in symptoms and a return to his baseline status.
Identifying toxicity early and correcting it rapidly may prevent life-threatening sequelae associated with amiodarone toxicity.

Abstract: The antiarrhythmic drug amiodarone accumulates in many organs of the body. Amiodarone lung disease (ALD) most commonly manifests clinically as an interstitial pneumonitis. The few reports of nodular ALD generally have been in the clinical and radiographic literature. No detailed histopathologic analysis of nodular ALD is available. We report 4 patients with nodular ALD, all of whom had excision of a nodule and none had a preoperative diagnosis of ALD. The radiographic suspicion before excisional biopsy in all 4 cases was malignancy. The initial pathologic suspicion in all 4 cases was either an abscess or vasculitis. In 3 of the 4 cases, where the dosages were known, each patient received 800 mg/d for 7 or more months. All cases have strikingly similar histopathology, with vacuolated histiocytes massed within alveoli to form macroscopic nodules with tissue breakdown. Ultrastructural examination of lung and peripheral nerve in 1 case showed the characteristic inclusions of amiodarone in the cytoplasm of swollen histiocytes. Vacuolated histiocytes filled with these inclusions indicate the effect of the drug, but in these 4 cases there was tissue destruction, which indicated disease. The necrotizing nature of the massed histiocytes in the absence of infection or obstruction suggests the correct etiologic diagnosis even when the history of administration of the drug is not available at initial review.

Abstract: Intravenous (IV) amiodarone hydrochloride has proven to be a very effective antiarrhythmic treatment option for a variety of ventricular and supraventricular arrhythmias in adults and paediatric patients. Amiodarone is known to have significant side effects and these especially include profound hypotension in animals and adults, vasodilatation, negative inotropic effects, and significant bradycardia especially when administered intravenously. Special caution is warranted in patients with decreased contractility and end-stage heart failure. We present a case of accidental amiodarone overdose in a newborn treated for atrial flutter resulting in cardiovascular collapse. The patient could be rescued by rapid initiation of VA-ECMO treatment. The patient survived without neurological damage.

Abstract: A fifty-seven year old gentleman developed hemolysis induced oliguric acute renal failure following multiple wasp stings. Patient was hemodynamically stable on dialytic support. Twelve days later, although the patient was recovering from renal failure, he developed sudden onset of tachyarrythmias and echocardiography demonstrated a Takotsubo type of cardiomyopathy. He was managed with amiodarone and hemodialysis. After two more episodes of deterioration, the patient made full recovery from both the renal and cardiac toxicity. A case of delayed Kounis syndrome associated with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy in the setting of acute renal failure is described. The possible mechanism of such a presentation is discussed.

Abstract: Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) is an immunologically mediated lung disease due to the repetitive inhalation of antigens. Most new cases arise from residential exposures, notably to birds, and are thus more difficult to recognise. The present authors report a 59-yr-old male who complained of dyspnoea and cough while being treated with amiodarone. Pulmonary function tests revealed restriction and obstruction with low diffusing lung capacity for carbon monoxide and partial pressure of oxygen. A high-resolution computed tomography chest scan and bronchoalveolar lavage showed diffuse bilateral ground-glass attenuation and lymphocytic alveolitis, respectively. Initial diagnosis was amiodarone pulmonary toxicity, but because of a rapidly favourable evolution, this diagnosis was questioned. A careful environmental history revealed a close contact with lovebirds shortly before the onset of symptoms. Precipitins were strongly positive against lovebird droppings, but were negative against other avian antigens. The patient was diagnosed with hypersensitivity pneumonitis to lovebirds. Avoidance of lovebirds and steroid treatment led to rapid improvement. The present observation identifies a new causative agent for hypersensitivity pneumonitis and highlights the importance of a thorough environmental history and of searching for precipitins against antigens directly extracted from the patient's environment. These two procedures should allow a more precise classification of some cases of pneumonitis, and thus might avoid progression of active undiagnosed hypersensitivity pneumonitis to irreversible fibrosis or emphysema.

Abstract: A 60-year-old male patient complaining of palpitations, fatigue, weakness and weight loss of 1 month's duration was hospitalized in our cardiology department for atrial fibrillation. Thyroid function test results were compatible with thyrotoxicosis. The patient had been taking amiodarone for 2.5 years for hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia episodes. However, amiodarone had been discontinued after follow-up examinations revealed that the patient's ventricular arrhythmias were no longer present, and he had been taking metoprolol only for the preceding 6 months. In this patient, amiodarone-induced thyroiditis had developed 6 months after cessation of treatment, demonstrating that adverse effects may occur after discontinuation of amiodarone. Detection of the condition requires assessment of thyroid function before treatment initiation, during treatment and at regular intervals after treatment cessation. The type of hyperthyroidism induced by amiodarone cannot be determined in most cases. Patients with this condition should be referred to an experienced endocrinologist. Our case of delayed amiodarone-induced thryoiditis occcurred approximately 6 months after termination of amiodarone treatment.

Abstract: Amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) is usually classified into two types: type 1, in which a high iodine content triggers the autonomous production of thyroid hormone; and type 2, in which destructive thyroiditis causes the release of preformed thyroid hormone. AIT is a difficult management problem that sometimes requires ablative thyroid therapy. The use of radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy in patients with type-1 AIT who had a 24-hour radioactive iodine uptake (RAIU) value of >10% has been previously reported. Despite its documented efficacy at usual doses (10-30 mCi) in patients with type-1 AIT, the efficacy of RAI in those with type-2 AIT has never been questioned, because type-2 patients usually have low RAIU. We thought that high adjusted-dose RAI might be an attractive alternative to thyroid gland ablation in patients with type-2 AIT.
Four patients with type-2 AIT who required thyroid ablation were included in the study. These individuals were either poor candidates for surgery or had refused surgery. The size of the thyroid gland in all subjects was within normal limits, and each thyroid was characterized by a homogenous echotexture on ultrasonography, the absence of vascularity on Doppler sonography, a low (<4%) 24-hour RAIU value and the absence of thyroid autoantibodies-all of which are characteristic of type-2 AIT.
The patients were initially treated with thionamides and glucocorticoids. All patients except one achieved euthyroidism before RAI therapy. All four patients received one dose of RAI (range 29-80 mCi) and followed up for 12 months. No exacerbation of thyrotoxicosis was noted after RAI therapy. Hypothyroidism (in three patients) or euthyroidism (in one patient) was achieved in first six months.
In patients with type-2 AIT, RAI treatment may be the therapy of choice for thyroid gland ablation.

Abstract: Authors describe a case of pulmonary masses and estensive skin pigmentation: "blue-gray syndrome" occurred in a patient in amiodarone therapy who presented with progressive dyspnea, cough, and fever. The diagnosis was suspected by detection of a high attenuation of the pulmonary masses on the nonenhanced chest computed tomography (CT) and lots of foamy macrophages in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Relief of respiratory symptoms and radiological improvement was achieved when amiodarone treatment was stopped.

Abstract: Spontaneous spinal epidural hematoma (SSEH) is an infrequent spinal pathology. Although it is related to numerous risk factors, its etiology remains unclear.
The aim of this article was to review the most important data in the literature about SSEH and to propose clopidogrel (Plavix) therapy as a risk factor.
Case report.
A 79-year-old woman was hospitalized in our unit with posterior thoracic pain and urinary retention of 72 hours duration. A clinical history was taken, and laboratory and imaging tests were performed. Urgent surgical decompression was performed, showing an epidural hematoma. Postoperative bacteriological cultures were negative, and microscopic analysis confirmed the diagnosis.
For this patient, clopidogrel (Plavix) therapy was the only risk factor related to SSEH.
In any patient under clopidogrel (Plavix): Sanofi-Synthelabo, Bristol-Myers Squibb/Sanofi Pharmaceuticals) therapy and with a typical clinical presentation, SSEH should be suspected and quickly diagnosed, regardless of hemostatic status or the absence of other major risk factors.

Abstract: We report the treatment of four thyrotoxic patients. Two were cases of type I amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) treated with methimazole. The third Graves' disease patient, who became hypothyroid 25 years after subtotal thyroidectomy, developed type II AIT. Furthermore, one case with heart failure and ventricular tachycardia, who developed an adverse reaction to antithyroid agents and was prescribed amiodarone, underwent total thyroidectomy. The clinical course was uneventful, and the patient is doing well. Since amiodarone contains a large amount of iodine, it is frequently difficult to make a differential diagnosis. Surgical treatment of Graves' disease patients is recommended when immediate control of hyperthyroidism and heart failure is required.

Abstract: Amiodarone has a high iodine content that can induce persistent iodine excess and may prevent radioiodine (RI) treatment.
A 55-year-old obese man had taken amiodarone (200 mg/d) for 3 years and stopped 2 years earlier. He underwent total thyroidectomy for papillary cancer with extrathyroidal extension and a metastatic central lymph node, requiring RI treatment. But iodine overload, with no other documented iodinated drug intake, was found (urinary iodine excretion = 472 microg/24 h; normal < 150 microg/24 h), and persisted 3 months later. Plasma exchanges (PE) were prescribed.
Eight PE over 4 weeks were needed to eliminate 39,295 nmol of iodine. Urinary iodine excretion and serum iodine concentrations, before PE and after eight sessions were, respectively: 230 and 84 nmol/mmol of creatinine, and 811 and 71 nmol/L, enabling RI treatment (4 GBq (131)I). Post-therapy whole-body scan revealed cervical uptake (0.48% of the total administered dose) corresponding to usual thyroid remnants. Ablation efficacy was confirmed 6 and 24 months later by cervical ultrasonography combined with an undetectable serum thyroglobulin level after recombinant human thyrotropin stimulation.
When spontaneous iodine elimination is too slow to allow RI treatment of high-risk thyroid carcinoma within a reasonable time after thyroidectomy, PE are reliable and effective to overcome iodine overload.

Abstract: To report a case of septic shock and community-acquired pneumonia in a patient with psoriatic arthritis receiving treatment with etanercept. PATIENT DETAILS: A 65-year-old woman diagnosed as having psoriatic arthritis had received treatment with etanercept. Chest X-ray studies were normal and the tuberculin skin test was negative. Two months after etanercept therapy, the patient presented to our emergency department with fever, cough, chest pain and generalized weakness. Chest radiography revealed a right pulmonary infiltrate. Her condition rapidly deteriorated and she went into shock with a further drop in her blood pressure, tachycardia and tachypnea. She was intubated, mechanically ventilated and was treated with fluids, cardioversion and amiodarone. Empiric therapy with levofloxacin, amikacin and cefepime were initiated. In the urinalysis, the result of a rapid test for Streptococcus pneumoniae was positive. Etanercept treatment was suspended due to a possible adverse reaction associated with this drug. At the start of therapy her clinical condition improved slowly. On Day 28, the patient was afebrile and she was discharged from the intensive care unit.
Most of the infections associated with etanercept therapy have been reported in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Based on our observations, etanercept was the possible offender in the development of septic shock and respiratory failure in community-acquired pneumonia. There was a temporal relationship between exposure to the drug and onset of symptoms. Etanercept was the only drug administered before the septic shock developed. Based on the Naranjo algorithm, the adverse reaction could be considered possible.
Patients initiated on etanercept should be counseled and receive appropriate screening before drug initiation. All febrile and newly occurring concomitant illnesses should be promptly evaluated. General practitioners should discontinue etanercept treatment and institute prompt and aggressive intervention if infection develops.

Abstract: Amiodarone is recommended for the cardioversion of atrial fibrillation and prevention of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in patients with structural heart disease, coronary artery disease or left ventricular dysfunction. It has well-recognised side-effects on the skin, lungs, liver, thyroid and eyes. Neurological side-effects, including ataxia and neuropathy, also occur, and may be more prevalent in older patients. These side-effects are reversible after cessation of amiodarone. Monitoring of amiodarone therapy should include assessment of the central and peripheral nervous system especially in older patients.

Abstract: We report on a 6-month-old patient with a right bundle, superior axis tachycardia at 197 beats per minute. The tachycardia was unresponsive to adenosine, propranolol, flecainide, or amiodarone, or synchronized cardioversion. Overdrive atrial pacing terminated the tachycardia and since initiating verapamil, no recurrences of his tachycardia have occurred.
If an infant presents with a right bundle, superior axis ventricular tachycardia unresponsive to multiple antiarrhythmic medications and synchronized cardioversion, but responsive to overdrive atrial pacing, one must consider verapamil-sensitive ventricular tachycardia and initiate appropriate therapy.

Abstract: The response over time of the QT interval and the Transmural Dispersion of Repolarization (TDR) to Isoproterenol infusion (ISO) in an 85 year-old-man with severe and syntomatic bradycardia, in the setting of an Amiodarone-induced Long QT Syndrome (LQTS) is the subject of this communication. ISO shortened the QT and decreased the TDR. We propose that ISO increased the generation of signals from the beta-Adrenergic Receptor (beta-AR) restoring the components of the hKCNQ1 macromolecular complex, thereby enhancing the I(Ks) function; shortening of the QT interval, reduction of the TDR and normalization of the T wave morphology was then possible. In Amiodarone-induced LQTS, the increase in I(Ks) activity promoted by beta-AR stimulation is prominent; at the same time, during I(Kr) block, I(Ks) activation limits excessive QT prolongation. Clinically, severe and syntomatic bradycardia was the main concern: ISO activation of the beta-AR proved useful both to increase heart rate and to reduce QT prolongation. A slow heart rate, associated to a prolonged QT interval and to a big TDR, are not sufficient to develop Torsades de Pointes in Amiodarone-induced LQTS.

Abstract: To report a case of amiodarone-induced keratopathy involving the entire cornea, including the endothelium.
Clinical case description and documentation with confocal laser scanning microscopy using the Heidelberg Retinal Tomography II (HRT II).
A 65 year-old man with a history of blurred vision and seeing halos around lights had been treated with amiodarone for 6 years. Best-corrected visual acuity was 20/25 in each eye. Slitlamp examination of both eyes showed a bilateral, symmetric, whorllike pattern of brown deposits in the inferocentral corneal epithelium. Diffuse and fine deposits resembling keratic precipitates in the central part of the endothelial face were also detected. Examination of the lens, optic nerve, and fundus in each eye did not show any abnormalities that could be attributed to the amiodarone therapy. Severe endothelial deposition was documented with the confocal laser scanning microscope of the HRT II.
Amiodarone-induced keratopathy with confluent and diffuse endothelial deposition is rare, and it may be indicative of a more severe toxicity associated with amiodarone.

Abstract: We present the case of a 71-year-old man, with known Parkinson's disease and previous coronary artery bypass surgery, who presented with acute chest pain. His initial 12 lead electrocardiogram (ECG) was unremarkable; however, a repeat 12 lead ECG during further chest pain suggested a ventricular tachycardia (VT) for which he was commenced on an intravenous amiodarone infusion. However, later analysis of his ECGs revealed that the apparent VT was, in fact, an artefact related to his parkinsonian tremor.

Abstract: We present a 46-year-old patient who suffered from cardiac arrest and subsequently underwent placement of an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). The patient underwent a cardiac catheterization which revealed no significant coronary artery disease. About 1 year later he experienced appropriated and frequent ICD discharges due to monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) with left bundle branch block morphology. His prodromal symptoms were mild dizziness and lightheadedness with no chest pain. Amiodarone, mexiletine, sotalol and dofetilide as well as ablation of two inducible ventricular tachycardias in the electrophysiology studies were unsuccessful in controlling the arrhythmias and ICD discharges. During the last episode, he experienced a mild burning sensation in his chest and was given nitroglycerin 0.4 mg sublingually, which relived his symptoms and aborted the VT. This led to a second cardiac catheterization to investigate whether the VT was being induced by myocardial ischemia. This second coronary angiogram spontaneously revealed significant coronary vasospasm and simultaneously, the patient's cardiac rhythm showed short runs of VT with left bundle branch block morphology. Intracoronary nitroglycerine relieved the coronary vasospasm and terminated the arrhythmia. The patient was treated with isosorbide mononitrate and diltiazem. He remained symptom free with no ICD discharges and no VT in ICD interrogations for more than 2 years. Coronary vasospasm may be silent and with no chest pain which creates a difficult clinical situation particularly if it is associated with ventricular tachycardia and sudden cardiac death. The mechanisms of VT in the setting of coronary vasospasm are not known and increased automaticity, focal discharges, functional unidirectional block with reentry, or a combination of these mechanisms may contribute to inducing the VT during the transient ischemia or rarely in the reperfusion phase. It is important to perform provocative tests to diagnose silent coronary vasospasm in unexplained sudden cardiac arrests.

Abstract: We describe an interesting case of a woman with decompensated cirrhosis, ischaemic heart disease and prolonged QT interval, who developed a new-onset atrial fibrillation. During amiodarone infusion a torsade de pointes occurred, which was immediately converted to sinus rhythm by synchronized cardioversion. A new episode of atrial fibrillation was treated with infusion of a beta-blocker (metoprolol) that restored sinus rhythm and normalized the QT interval. Delayed repolarization, frequently observed in ischaemic heart disease, cirrhosis and pro-arrhythmic drugs administration, represents the background for the development of torsade de pointes. Our report underlines that the potential harmfulness of a prolonged QT interval in cirrhotic patients is currently not perceived in its entirety, so that various categories of drugs affecting ventricular repolarization are rather thoughtlessly used in clinical practice without monitoring the QT interval. Thus, amiodarone should be avoided, if possible, or used with extreme care in arrhythmic patients with advanced liver disease. Moreover, beta-blockers may be considered the first-line treatment for rate-control during supraventricular tachyarrhythmias in cirrhotic patients with delayed repolarization.

Abstract: The torpedo ray is a fish with powerful electric organs, which can serve either as predatory tool or defensive weapon. The name comes from the Latin 'torpere', to be stiffened or paralysed, referring to the effect on someone who handles or steps on a living electric ray.
To present an unusual case of atrial fibrillation due to electric shocks by the torpedo ray (electric ray).
A 42-year-old male commercial diver presented with atrial fibrillation after receiving repeated electric shocks from a torpedo ray while on routine diving operations. Such occurrences are extremely rare and we could find no documented case in the medical literature.
Electric current can damage the body by disrupting electric rhythms, inducing muscular spasms and burns. In this case, we report atrial fibrillation in a diver exposed to repeated electric shocks from a torpedo ray.

Abstract: Gastric bypass is increasingly used in morbidly obese patients to achieve significant reduction of body weight and fat mass and concurrent improvement in co-morbidities. We report the case of a 53-year-old male patient (141 kg, BMI 50 kg/m2), successfully treated by amiodarone for supraventricular arrythmia, who underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGBP). 6 months after surgery, he had lost 45% of his preoperative weight (44.8% of weight loss was lean mass) and developed amiodarone-induced subclinical hyperthyroidism. We hypothesize the following sequence of events: weight loss after RYGBP, therefore fat loss, decrease in distribution volume of amiodarone inducing iodine overload and hyperthyroidism, reinforcing weight loss and particularly loss of lean mass. This report emphasizes the importance of careful monitoring of weight and body composition changes after RYGBP. In this situation, checking thyroid status is recommended, especially when there is a history of thyroid disease or potentially toxic thyroid medication.

Abstract: To report a fatal case of amiodarone-induced acute hepatotoxicity after intravenous amiodarone administration and similar fatal cases review.
A 72-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, prior cardiovascular disease, atrial fibrillation and diabetes mellitus was admitted to the hospital with acute pyelonephritis and transferred to the intensive care unit due to cerebral infarction. An antidiabetic drug, a low dose of aspirin and intravenous amiodarone therapy was started. After receiving a second dose of amiodarone (1,200 mg; injection rate 1 mg/min), the woman developed ascites, jaundice, high levels of serum transaminases, decreased prothrombin time, and finally became unconscious. Immediately after treatment was discontinued, her extremely high hepatic parameters returned to normal. According to the Naranjo probability scale, this adverse reaction was highly probable.
The occurrence of acute liver damage after intravenous amiodarone is rare but harmful. It can be induced by polysorbate 80, a solubilizer, by immunomediated centrilobular necrosis, or by the presence of a functional PPAR-I+/- gene.
Amiodarone is an effective antiarrhythmic agent for preventing and treating atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. The molecular mechanism causing acute hepatic damage after amiodarone treatment is not clear. Therefore, amiodarone must be administered with care, and liver function should be monitored closely in patients treated with this drug.

Abstract: For decades, the photodistributed blue-gray skin hyperpigmentation observed after amiodarone therapy was presumably attributed to dermal lipofuscinosis. Using electron microscopy and high-performance liquid chromatography, we identified amiodarone deposits in the hyperpigmented skin sample from a patient treated with this antiarrhythmic agent. Our findings therefore indicate that the hypothesis relating the blue-gray hyperpigmentation to lipofuscin should be challenged.
A 64-year-old man, skin phototype III, presented with asymptomatic skin hyperpigmentation that had been slowly developing on sun-exposed areas since April 2004. He had been taking amiodarone for 4 years (cumulative dose, 277 g). Electron microscopy did not show lipofuscin pigments in his skin. Conversely, abundant electron-dense membrane-bound granule deposits were observed in most of the dermal cells (fibroblasts, macrophages, pericytes, Schwann cells, and endothelial cells), especially in photoexposed skin. High-performance liquid chromatography confirmed that the skin deposits were composed of amiodarone. These results demonstrate that amiodarone hyperpigmentation is related to drug deposition on photoexposed skin.
Amiodarone-related hyperpigmentation should be considered a skin storage disease that is secondary to drug deposition.

Abstract: A 75-year old man with long-term arterial hypertension was diagnosed in 1998 with stage 3 chronic kidney disease due to hypertensive nephropathy. Since May 2004 the patient has been treated with intermittent hemodialysis. Since 1998 he has been hospitalized several times because of palpitations in the course of paroxysmal tachycardia with narrow QRS complexes. Initially, class I antiarrhythmic agents were administered; afterwards therapy with beta-adrenolytics was introduced. Because of the ineffectiveness of monotherapy, beta-adrenolytic therapy was combined with amiodarone; however, side effects of this treatment in a form of drug-induced bradycardia appeared. During an invasive electrophysiological investigation, a typical recurrent atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) was repeatedly released. Subsequently performed percutaneous ablation resulted in effective modification of the slow pathway. During 25 months of follow up after the procedure, recurrence of AVNRT was not observed. Effectiveness of ablation and low risk of adverse effects in non-dialyzed patients encourage us to recommend this method of AVNRT treatment also in patients undergoing intermittent hemodialysis.

Abstract: A 52-year-old woman with hypertension and Graves' disease was scheduled for surgical removal of a meningioma. Intraoperative events were significant for hypotension requiring a vasopressin infusion. Prophylactic dolasetron was administered to the patient before emergence. The patient's trachea was easily extubated and she was neurologically intact at the end of the surgical procedure. On transport to the neurological intensive care unit, the patient developed torsades de pointes, requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation, before a return to normal sinus rhythm.

Abstract: Deglutition induced supraventricular tachycardia is an uncommon condition postulated to be a vagally mediated phenomenon due to mechanical stimulation. Patients usually present with mild symptoms or may have severe debilitating symptoms. Treatment with Class I agents, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, amiodarone and radiofrquency catheter ablation has shown to be successful in the majority of reported cases. We report the case of a 46-year-old healthy woman presenting with palpitations on swallowing that was documented to be transient atrial tachycardia with aberrant ventricular conduction as well as transient atrial fibrillation. She was successfully treated with propafenone with no induction of swallowing-induced tachycardia after treatment. This is also the first case to show swallowing-induced atrial tachycardia and atrial fibrillation in the same patient.

Abstract: Amiodarone is well recognized as an anti-arrhythmic drug containing a high dose of iodine with considerable potential to cause thyroid dysfunction. The present patient was a 66-year-old Japanese woman who developed a cardiac arrhythmia and was given amiodarone as an anti-arrhythmic agent for approximately 3 months, until the day before her death. However, 19 days after starting amiodarone, serum testing indicated a hypothyroid status that was not recognized clinically. At autopsy, microscopy showed that most of the thyroid follicles were enlarged with dense colloid substance and lined by flattened follicular cells (involuted follicles). There were a small number of damaged follicles infiltrated by macrophages, which were immunopositive for HAM56. Sudan IV staining indicated many lipid droplets in follicular cells. Ultrastructurally the follicular cells contained large residual bodies composed of abundant electron-lucent lipid droplets of variable size. Although it is difficult to be certain of the direct link of amiodarone on the basis of a single case, it is reasonable to presume that this histopathology is associated with amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism and that involution changes represent the hypofunctional status of this drug-induced disorder. This is the first report on the histopathological findings of thyroid tissue from a patient with amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism.

Abstract: Amiodarone is one of the commonly used anti-arrhythmic agents with well-recognized chronic pulmonary toxicity. We present our experience of a patient with a fatal outcome after coronary artery bypass grafting and a short course of amiodarone treatment with a low total cumulative dose for the treatment of postoperative atrial fibrillation. Necropsy revealed diffuse pulmonary damage due to acute amiodarone lung toxicity.

Abstract: Syncope may be a manifestation of pulmonary embolism. Occlusion of a pulmonary artery with cardiac output drop, sometimes resulting in cardiac arrest, is the main underlying mechanism. In this letter we describe the case of a patient in which the persistence of a long remnant of the embryonal Chiari's network could have worked as an anatomic barrier preventing massive pulmonary embolism and cardiac arrest.

Abstract: Cardiac electrical storm has been described as three or more distinct episodes of ventricular fibrillation or hemodynamically destabilizing ventricular tachycardia in a 24-h period, typically requiring treatment with electrical cardioversion or defibrillation. We report the case of a 45-year-old man who presented to the Emergency Department with idiopathic cardiac electrical storm, ultimately requiring defibrillation over 30 times in the Emergency Department and infusion of multiple antidysrhythmic agents for dysrhythmia control. Treatment of cardiac electrical storm entails immediate resuscitative therapy during the hemodynamically destabilizing episode (including cardioversion/defibrillation and the timely administration of antidysrhythmic agents), concurrent identification and correction of any factors that are potentially contributing to the acute dysrhythmia (i.e., electrolyte disturbances, myocardial ischemia), and ultimately, institution of long-term preventive therapy (such as an implantable cardioverter defibrillator) to quell recurrence. Amiodarone and beta-adrenergic blockers seem to be the agents of greatest clinical benefit to patients with cardiac electrical storm. Despite its potentially devastating nature, the majority of patients with cardiac electrical storm may have favorable clinical outcomes if the dysrhythmias are treated swiftly and aggressively.

Abstract: We report the case of a 60 year old female patient on continuous systemic anticoagulation therapy with coumarin due to mechanical aortic valve replacement and a more than 3 years lasting amiodarone therapy due to severe ventricular extrasystoles suffering from amiodarone induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT). During the course of AIT, showing different thyroid metabolic conditions, INR levels revealed a course closely related to the thyroid conditions indicating a significant and clear-cut effect of both hyper- and hypothyroidism on systemic anticoagulation therapy with coumarin. This continuous interaction of different thyroid metabolic conditions and the anticoagulation state could be well documented in the presented case over a time period of approximately five months.

Abstract: Amiodarone chlorhydrate is a diiodated benzofuran derivative, and it is used to treat cardiac rhythm abnormalities. Hepatotoxicity is a relatively uncommon side effect of amiodarone, and symptomatic hepatic dysfunction occurs in fewer than 1% of the patients taking amiodarone. Cirrhosis is a rare complication that's been confirmed in 12 cases. Peripheral neuropathy occurs in 10% of patients taking aminodarone. We report here on an unusual case of amiodarone-induced hepatotoxicity and peripheral neurotoxicity. A 75 year old man with normal liver function was given amiodarone for treating his atrial fibrillation and heart failure. He developed nausea, vomiting, muscle weakness and wasting after 17.8 months therapy with amiodarone (400 mg orally once per day). Liver biopsy showed the presence of foam cells in the hepatic sinusoids and Mallory bodies in the periportal hepatocytes on light microscopy. Sural nerve biopsy showed demyelination, and nerve conduction studies showed mixed sensorimotor polyneuropathy. These observations show the necessity of monitoring the hepatic function and conducting neurologic examination of the patients treated with amiodarone.

Abstract: The implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) may be responsible for psychological disorders especially among patients experiencing multiple shocks. An associated hyperadrenergic state (e.g., anger, anxiety) may trigger malignant ventricular arrhythmias repeatedly treated by ICD shocks, entertaining a "vicious circle" often difficult to interrupt. Despite aggressive cardiac and psychological therapeutic efforts, this condition may be refractory, finally leading to heart transplantation, as described in this case report.

Abstract: The combination of ventricular tachycardia (VT) and severe left ventricular dysfunction presents a serious challenge in management of acute fulminant myocarditis (AFM). We report a case of a 17-month-old girl with AFM, presented with hypotension and VT, successfully treated with respiratory and inotropic support, high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin, and amiodarone. The myocardial function improved significantly within 2 weeks of treatment. The clinical course was complicated by significant amiodarone-induced hepatotoxicity, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and deep-vein thrombosis. She was later diagnosed with congenital dysfibrinogenemia and treated with chronic Lovenox therapy.

Abstract: TSH-secreting pituitary adenomas (TSH-omas) are a rare cause of hyperthyroidism in clinical practice. As their diagnosis is often delayed, these tumors are mostly diagnosed as macroadenomas, preventing an effective and radical cure and leading to serious local and systemic comorbidities. In addition to neurosurgery, medical therapy with the effective and tolerable SS analogs is a fundamental tool for the treatment of TSHomas. We report 3 cases of TSH-macroadenomas which displayed different clinical presentations. All patients showed increased free-thyroid hormone levels with inappropriately normal (2 patients) or high (1 patient) TSH levels. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)/computed tomography (CT) evidenced a pituitary macroadenoma and octreoscan was positive in all patients. In the 2 patients who underwent neurosurgery, hormonal hypersecretion by the tumor normalized. Histology showed nuclear pleomorphism and fibrosis, whereas immunohistochemistry showed positivity for TSH and, in a lesser amount, for FSH. In one of these patient (case 1), however, the presence of a tumor remnant inside the left cavernous sinus prompted us, in accordance with the patient, to start therapy with octreotide- long-acting release. As the third patient had a cardiac comorbidity which contraindicated neurosurgery, he underwent satisfactory treatment with long-acting SS analogs alone which normalized thyroid hormone levels. In this case, previous treatment with amiodarone confused and delayed the correct diagnosis of TSH-oma. As a result of improved laboratory and morphological techniques, TSH-omas should currently be diagnosed in early stages, thus enabling most patients to be managed satisfactorily through a combined approach.

Abstract: This case report describes a 30-week gestation neonate who presented at birth with hydrops fetalis due to atrial flutter. Digoxin and electric cardioversion were unsuccessful in maintaining a stable sinus rhythm. The infant continued with intractable atrial flutter and severe hemodynamic deterioration until intravenous loading of amiodarone achieved conversion to stable sinus rhythm. Amiodarone was continued for 45 days; there was no recurrence of atrial flutter. Of note, the infant developed severe chronic lung disease after mechanical ventilation for 28 days. A lung biopsy ruled out amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity. A table is provided reviewing the different forms of neonatal supraventricular tachycardias. Apart from the successful management of the tachycardia, the role of amiodarone as an effective antiarrhythmic agent and its potential side effects, such as pulmonary toxicity and transient hypothyroidism, are discussed.

Abstract: The case of a patient whose serum transaminase levels became elevated after concomitant use of rosuvastatin and amiodarone is described.
A 73-year-old white woman with a medical history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypothyroidism, hyperlipidemia, and aortic stenosis reported to a clinic on February 9, 2006. Laboratory tests revealed the following values: total cholesterol, 172 mg/dL; low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol, 96 mg/dL; high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol, 55 mg/dL; triglycerides, 105 mg/dL; aspartate transaminase (AST), 14 IU/L; alanine transaminase (ALT), 13 IU/L; alkaline phosphatase (ALP), 68 IU/L; and serum creatinine (SCr), 1.1 mg/dL. At this time, rosuvastatin 5 mg daily was initiated. On April 20, 2006, laboratory tests revealed an AST of 30 IU/L, ALT of 58 IU/L, ALP of 99 IU/L, and SCr of 1.0 mg/dL. Because of the severity of her aortic stenosis, the patient underwent aortic valve replacement on May 15, 2006, and amiodarone was initiated. Laboratory tests completed on May 31, 2006, revealed an AST of 192 IU/L, ALT of 336 IU/L, ALP of 322 IU/L, and SCr of 1.1 mg/dL. She did not report any symptoms of myopathy or liver dysfunction. Ultrasound revealed no liver abnormalities. The rosuvastatin was discontinued because of a potential interaction with the amiodarone. One week after the rosuvastatin was stopped, her laboratory tests showed an AST of 68 IU/L, an ALT of 126 IU/L, an ALP of 292 IU/L, a creatine kinase concentration of 22 IU/L, and an SCr of 1.0 mg/dL. Two months later, her liver function test values had continued to decline.
A potential interaction between rosuvastatin and amiodarone resulted in asymptomatic elevation of serum transaminase levels in a 73-year-old woman.

Abstract: We present two patients who had life-threatening arrhythmias, which are highly likely to be secondary to amiodarone. This class III anti-arrhythmic is commonly prescribed for the acute presentation of supra-ventricular and ventricular arrhythmias. However, occasionally its use can transform arrhythmias from benign to dangerous. These cases highlight the need for careful attention to the indications, cautions and contra-indications of amiodarone as well as the need for vigilance following initiation of anti-arrhythmic therapy.

Abstract: A case is presented of cardiac arrhythmia associated with varicella zoster infection, affecting a 34-year-old man. The patient presented with episodes of seizure-like activity, which were subsequently shown to be caused by ventricular fibrillation. The literature regarding this unusual complication of varicella zoster infection is discussed, as it affects both children and adults. Physicians who may face this condition, in accident and emergency, acute medicine, critical care medicine and infectious diseases, should all be aware of this serious complication.

Abstract: A 75-year-old man had a myocardial infarction complicated by poor left ventricular function and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. He began treatment with amiodarone and 12 months later developed symptoms of thyrotoxicosis.
Thyroid function tests after commencement of amiodarone revealed a high-normal level of free T4 and low-normal level of free T3 with a normal serum TSH. When symptoms of thyrotoxicosis developed, significant rises in T4 and T3 levels and suppression of TSH were observed. Thyroid autoantibodies were detected and thyroid ultrasonography revealed a small multinodular goiter.
Amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) with features consistent with both AIT type I (in which thyroid antibodies and nodular goiter are present) and AIT type II (which is not responsive to thionamide therapy and eventually leads to permanent hypothyroidism).
The patient continued to be treated with amiodarone. He commenced thionamide (carbimazole) therapy but failed to improve, even after a dose increase. Glucocorticoid (prednisolone) therapy was therefore added. Combination therapy was associated with gradual clinical and biochemical improvement. The patient became persistently hypothyroid after stopping thionamide and glucocorticoid therapy and was stabilized on long-term thyroxine replacement.

Abstract: Rhabdomyolysis is a well known side effect of statin therapy. Several drugs may increase its risk by drug-drug interactions. In particular, patients with heart disease receive more and more different compounds to cope with all the pathomechanisms involved and may therefore be of high risk for side effects. We report a case of rhabdomyolysis in a patient with heart failure on a multi-drug regimen caused by a drug interaction between chronic statin therapy (simvastatin), amiodarone and newly administrated digitoxin. The patient recovered fully after cessation of simvastatin therapy, the other drugs were given continuously. Potential mechanisms of this event are discussed. Most interesting in this case is that rhabdomyolysis occurred only after starting digitoxin after long-term therapy with the statin.

Abstract: Silent thyroiditis, excluding postpartum thyroiditis and destructive amiodarone thyroiditis, is a relatively uncommon cause of thyrotoxicosis and recurrent cases are even rarer. We present four patients with recurrent silent thyroiditis. The number of episodes ranged from two to nine. All four patients had episodes that were similar in duration (4-6 weeks) as well as in their clinical (no viral prodrome or neck pain), biochemical (high total triiodothyronine [T(3)], free thyroxine [T(4)], and low thyrotropin [TSH] presence of antibodies to thyroid antigens), and scintigraphic (low radioiodine uptake) findings. Individual symptoms and symptom-free duration (from 1 to 4 years) were more variable. No associations were found with regard to medications, pregnancies, or other disease states previously implicated in thyroiditis. One patient was unsuccessfully prescribed thyroid hormone to prevent recurrence. Three were treated with radioablative iodine therapy during the recovery phase of an episode; they became hypothyroid and take replacement l-thyroxine. They have remained symptom free.

Abstract: Epididymitis, as an unusual side-effect of amiodarone use, in a patient with dilated cardiomyopathy is reported along with a pertinent literature review. The diagnosis was one of exclusion after the patient received several regimens of antimicrobials and was only established after a dose reduction of the amiodarone regimen. Cardiologists should be aware of this rare but existing side effect of amiodarone, in order promptly intervene with dose adjustment or discontinuation of amiodarone and to avoid prolonged use of unnecessary antimicrobial regimens.

Abstract: The presence of dual pathology can cause diagnostic dilemmas. We present a case of adenocarcinoma of the ampulla of Vater with concurrent amiodarone hepatotoxicity.
Painless jaundice associated with a palpable gallbladder was investigated clinically, radiologically, endoscopically and via liver biopsy.
Liver biopsy showed amiodarone hepatotoxicity. Endoscopic biopsy identified an ampullary adenoma. However, the endoscopic ultrasound and intra-operative findings suggested a malignancy, which was confirmed postoperatively.
While the classic findings of Courvoisier's Law are borne out in this case, the etiology of jaundice is twofold. Although dual pathology is uncommon it should always be considered.

Abstract: Associated symptoms and conduction disturbances are reported during acute inferior myocardial infarction. Differentiation of right coronary artery from left circumflex artery occlusion may be difficult since both can present an electrocardiographic pattern of inferior myocardial infarction. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is considered a frequent complication of acute myocardial infarction and the patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation probably should be targeted for earlier and more aggressive treatment. These patients in the thrombolytic era have a better overall outcome than counterparts in the prethrombolytic era. We describe a case of conduction disturbances and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in a 51-year-old Italian man with acute inferior myocardial infarction and right coronary artery stenosis.

Abstract: To present an unusual case of amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) associated with an autonomously functioning thyroid nodule, which was detected by means of a technetium scan; review the existing literature regarding the association of AIT with autonomous thyroid nodules; and explore the use of radioisotope imaging studies in patients with AIT.
We describe a 62-year-old man with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, receiving long-term amiodarone therapy, who was referred by his cardiologist for evaluation of abnormal thyroid function tests. He was found to have an unusual case of AIT, associated with an autonomously functioning thyroid nodule.
Thyroid function studies obtained by the patient's cardiologist had shown a completely suppressed thyrotropin level and a free thyroxine level of 3.5 ng/dL. A 24-hour thyroid iodine 123 uptake and technetium Tc 99m pertechnetate scan revealed a "single, strong focus in the right thyroid lobe, with the rest of the thyroid gland...not well visualized." Thyroid ultrasonography disclosed a single, well-defined 1.5-cm solid nodule. Repeated thyroid function studies revealed a normal thyrotropin level of 2.87 micro IU/mL and a normal free thyroxine level of 2.4 ng/dL. The patient was managed conservatively with follow-up surveillance.
Prospective studies should be performed to better ascertain the value of Tc 99m thyroid scanning in determining the cause of AIT. Until such studies have been completed, we suggest that nuclear studies are unlikely to be cost-effective for assessing all patients with AIT. One logical strategy would be to gain experience with scans in only those patients with known thyroid nodules, which have been detected during physical examination or by ultrasonography. The potential clinical utility of such an approach would be of considerable interest.

Abstract: Brugada syndrome (BS) may be "unmasked" by several pharmacological and/or physiological agents in an otherwise normal electrocardiogram. Once diagnosed the possibility of persistent ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation exists. Although this is treated with various antiarrhythmic agents, there remains a cohort of patients who fail to respond to conventional antiarrhythmic therapy therefore, amplifying the electrical storm. We report a case of a BS diagnosed via procainamide challenge, the resultant near fatal electrical storm aggravated by amiodarone and the eventual resolution with isoproterenol.

Abstract: To report a case of a severe interaction between simvastatin, amiodarone, and atazanavir resulting in rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure.
A 72-year-old white man with underlying human immunodeficiency virus, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, and hyperlipidemia presented with generalized pain, fatigue, and dark orange urine for 3 days. The patient was taking 80 mg simvastatin at bedtime (initiated 27 days earlier); amiodarone at a dose of 400 mg daily for 7 days, then 200 mg daily (initiated 19 days earlier); and 400 mg atazanavir daily (initiated at least 2 years previously). Laboratory evaluation revealed 66,680 U/L creatine kinase, 93 mg/dL blood urea nitrogen, 4.6 mg/dL creatinine, 1579 U/L aspartate aminotransferase, and 738 U/L alanine aminotransferase. Simvastatin, amiodarone, and the patient's human immunodeficiency virus medications were all temporarily discontinued and the patient was given forced alkaline diuresis and started on dialysis. Nine days later the patient's creatine kinase had dropped to 1695 U/L and creatinine was 3.3 mg/dL. The patient was discharged and continued outpatient dialysis for 1 month until his renal function recovered.
The risk of rhabdomyolysis is increased in the presence of concomitant drugs that inhibit simvastatin metabolism. Simvastatin is metabolized by CYP3A4. Amiodarone and atazanavir are recognized CYP3A4 inhibitors.
Pharmacokinetic differences in statins are an important consideration for assessing the risk of potential drug interactions. In patients requiring the concurrent use of statins and CYP3A4 inhibitors, pravastatin, fluvastatin, and rosuvastatin carry the lowest risk of drug interactions; atorvastatin carries moderate risk, whereas simvastatin and lovastatin have the highest risk and should be avoided in patients taking concomitant CYP3A4 inhibitors.

Abstract: To describe a case of a hypersensitivity reaction to oral amiodarone in a patient with a previous reaction to an iodinated radiocontrast agent.
A 55-year-old man experienced facial urticaria after intraarterial injection of iohexol, an iodinated radiocontrast agent, during coronary angiography, which was successfully treated with intravenous hydrocortisone and promethazine. The procedure revealed significant triple vessel disease, and the patient subsequently underwent coronary artery bypass grafting in October 2006. Postoperatively, the patient experienced 2 episodes of fast atrial fibrillation, the first of which was treated successfully with intravenous amiodarone. The second episode resulted in the commencement of therapy with oral amiodarone 400 mg 3 times daily. Within one hour after the first dose, the patient experienced lip swelling and tingling, which was again treated with intravenous promethazine. Amiodarone was stopped; the patient remained in sinus rhythm and was discharged without further incident.
Amiodarone is a class III antiarrhythmic agent frequently used in the management of atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery. The approved product information lists known hypersensitivity to iodine as a contraindication to its administration, but no other cases of amiodarone hypersensitivity in a patient with a previous reaction to an iodinated radiocontrast agent have been published. Conversely, it has been suggested that the drug may be safely used in such patients. The Naranjo probability scale supported a probable adverse reaction of hypersensitivity associated with amiodarone therapy in this patient.
Prescribers should exercise caution in the administration of amiodarone to patients with a true, documented history of hypersensitivity to an iodinated compound.

Abstract: Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD) is a complex arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy, characterized by a partial or total replacement of the right ventricular myocytes by fatty and fibrous tissue. In this study, we present a case of ARVD in 17 year old girl, who was admitted to the hospital after syncope with ventricular arrhythmia. The echocardiography did not demonstrate structural cardiac abnormalities but the magnetic resonance recently showed thinning of the right ventricular wall. The girl was treated with the lidocaine, amiodarone and next, after radiofrequency catheter ablation she was receiving metoprolol. The girl has remained asymptomatic for four years of follow-up.

Abstract: Amiodarone-related pneumonitis is a potentially limiting factor for amiodarone usage. However, it is believed that amiodarone-related pneumonitis is unlikely to occur during low-dose and short courses of therapy. We report three patients who received low-dose amiodarone, 200 mg/day, for an average of 6.6 months and who developed amiodarone-related pneumonitis. All patients were male with age of 75, 93 and 85, respectively, and had the habit of cigarette smoking. The initial presentation was dyspnea without symptoms and signs of heart failure. Their chest radiographs showed diffuse interstitial pneumonitis pattern and chest computed tomography scan also confirmed interstitial pneumonitis. Treatment included cessation of amiodarone and corticosteroid usage. All patients improved symptomatically by early detection and early treatment. This case report implies that old age and possible pre-existing pulmonary abnormalities caused by smoking could be associated with amiodarone-related pulmonary toxicity. Clinicians must remain alert to detect amiodarone-related pneumonitis even under low dosage and short duration of amiodarone usage. Immediate withdrawal of amiodarone and prompt steroid therapy will ensure full recovery.

Abstract: It is not uncommon for patients with severe ischemic or nonischemic cardiomyopathy to have recurrent ventricular arrhythmias. Many of these arrhythmias remain asymptomatic and can be controlled with beta-blockers or amiodarone. However, for a subset of these patients, the arrhythmia is persistent and requires antitachycardic pacing, internal defibrillation, or radiofrequency ablation therapy. We present a patient with end-stage nonischemic cardiomyopathy and recurrent ventricular tachycardia (VT) who was listed for cardiac transplantation. His VT was not responsive to medical management, and standard endocardial or epicardial VT radiofrequency ablation (VTRFA) procedures. Therefore, this patient underwent successful ethanol septal ablation (ESA) to obliterate the source of arrhythmia. Five days after the ablation procedure, he underwent cardiac transplantation. Therefore, this case presents a rare opportunity to review the use of ESA for refractory VT and an excellent opportunity to review the acute pathologic and histologic changes induced by ESA.

Abstract: A 65-year-old Caucasian male with a shellfish allergy developed atrial fibrillation and hypotension after coronary artery bypass and duodenal ulcer surgery. Following electrical cardioversion, oral amiodarone was continued chronically without an allergic reaction. There is a common misconception that a shellfish allergy correlates to an iodine allergy. There is little documentation of the association between an allergy to shellfish and an allergy to iodine. Food allergies can be subcategorized based on the involvement of IgE. Upon further investigation, it was discovered that shellfish allergies are not due to the iodine component, but rather, to a protein found in the shellfish. Amiodarone can be safely used in patients with shellfish allergies. A shellfish allergy does not necessarily imply an iodine allergy.

Abstract: The effect of cardiac resynchronisation therapy on ventricular tachycardias (VT) has not been well established. This case-report demonstrates the favourable impact of biventricular pacing on ventricular arrhythmias. In 2004, a patient with dilated cardiomyopathy and ICD since 1999 was admitted to our Division for multiple VT. While left ventricular function was markedly reduced and mitral regurgitation was severe, he was asymptomatic for heart failure. Amiodarone was not administered on account of a documented proarrhythmic effect. The patient's ICD was upgraded to an ICD-biventricular system. After upgrading, a significant reduction in the number of VT was noted.

Abstract: We describe full exposure of an acquired Long QT Syndrome (aLQTS) in an elderly female patient on long-term Amiodarone treatment. We propose that the aLQTS is the result of combined block of the rapid (I(Kr)) and delayed (I(Ks)) components of the outward potassium current (I(K)), translated to the ECG in a (more than expected) prolonged QT interval, an augmented transmural dispersion of repolarization (TDR) and an interrupted T wave. The unequal regression of repolarization lengthening made possible to individualize I(K) current components in the inscription of the interrupted T wave, which argues against the U wave as a separate entity. Silent ion channel gene mutations or polymorphisms and downregulation of beta-adrenergic activation of I(Ks) may underlie the unusual repolarization behaviour. The unequal regression over time of Amiodarone-induced repolarization lengthening could have clinical significance.

Abstract: Cyclophosphamide is a chemotherapeutic agent with the potential to cause pulmonary toxicity, most commonly in the form of diffuse alveolar damage. Cyclophosphamide-induced pulmonary toxicity is extremely rare and often difficult to recognize because of presence of confounding factors, including use of other cytotoxic drugs, radiation pneumonitis, oxygen toxicity, pulmonary infections, and malignancies. The lung toxicity caused by cyclophosphamide is accelerated when cyclophosphamide is combined with amiodarone, an antiarrhythmic agent also capable of lung toxicity. We describe a patient with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who developed fatal pulmonary toxicity after a single dose of cyclophosphamide in the setting of long-term amiodarone use.

Abstract: Amiodarone, a class III antiarrhythmic drug, is one of the most effective drugs used in the treatment of ventricular and paroxysmal supraventricular tachyarrhythmia. Adverse effects of amiodarone including pulmonary toxicity, hepatotoxicity, aggravation of arrhythmia, and thyroid diseases are well understood. A 66-year old woman with acute pancreatitis was admitted to our hospital with the complaint of epigastralgia radiating to both flanks for two months. Her symptoms and elevation of pancreatic enzymes did not respond to conventional medical treatment of pancreatitis for 18 d. No known causal factors for pancreatitis such as biliary tract stone, hypertriglyceridemia and alcohol consumption could be identified. Under the suspicion of amiodarone-induced acute pancreatitis, amiodarone was substituted by propafenone. Her symptoms soon alleviated and serum lipase level declined. Three months after hospital discharge, the abdominal pain did not recur. Amiodarone was approved to treat recurrent ventricular fibrillation or sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia that has been resistant to other medications since 1986. Pancreatitis is a very rare adverse effect associated with the use of amiodarone, and only four cases of amiodarone-induced pancreatitis have been reported in literature. We report a patient who developed acute pancreatitis during amiodarone therapy.

Abstract: Evidence to guide resuscitation from transfusion-related hyperkalaemic ventricular fibrillation is sparse. This case report describes a 29 kg patient undergoing scoliosis surgery who developed hyperkalaemic ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation following the replacement of over two blood volumes with banked blood in 90 minutes. Rapid reversion to sinus rhythm followed administration of 1.4 mmol of calcium chloride and two units of insulin (Actrapid, Novo Nordisk). The relevant literature is reviewed, indicating that an elevated serum ionised calcium level protects against hyperkalaemia, by an intracellular mechanism. Evidence supports the use of lignocaine, but not amiodarone, as additional treatment.

Abstract: Amiodarone therapy is associated with several adverse effects, including hematologic ones such as pancytopenia, hemolytic anemia, and aplastic anemia. Very few cases of amiodarone-associated bone marrow granulomas have been reported. We report 2 cases of amiodarone-associated bone marrow granulomas. Patient 1 was an 81-year-old man who presented with leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and hepatosplenomegaly after 2 years of amiodarone therapy. Patient 2 was an 80-year-old man who presented with pancytopenia 2 1/2 years after starting amiodarone treatment. Both patients had normal blood counts before amiodarone therapy. Bone marrow biopsies showed noncaseating granulomas in both patients. We reviewed the literature available on Medline for amiodarone-associated bone marrow granulomas and found 8 reported cases of amiodarone-associated bone marrow granulomas. One case also featured amiodarone-associated hepatic granulomas. Amiodarone therapy was stopped in 5 cases, with improvement of the granulomas occurring in 3 cases. We conclude that bone marrow granulomas, although rare, should be considered as a differential diagnosis for patients undergoing amiodarone therapy and presenting with cytopenias.

Abstract: A case of ventricular noncompaction with Giant P waves and focal atrial tachycardia is presented. A 36-year-old man was admitted to our hospital because of palpitations and a progressive worsening of heart failure. A 12 lead rest electrocardiogram showed large positive waves followed by smaller negative waves in limb leads and lead V1 which seemed to represent QRS complexes followed by retrograde P waves at first glance. Electrocardiogram revealed supraventricular tachycardia when palpitations occurred in this patient without any obvious triggers. Intravenous administration of amiodarone decreased the ventricular response by depression of conduction across the AV node which confirmed the diagnosis of focal atrial tachycardia.

Abstract: A 31-year-old man with dilated cardiomyopathy was hospitalized for new-onset atrial fibrillation. Oral amiodarone 600 mg/day was started to control his arrhythmia, and the patient continued to receive digoxin 0.125 mg/day, which was prescribed 4 days earlier at a heart failure clinic. The patient's digoxin plasma concentration peaked early on hospital day 3 at 2.93 ng/ml; digoxin was withheld. Over the next 3 days, the patient's digoxin plasma concentrations rose and fell daily. These fluctuations correlated with the timing of blood sampling in relation to oral amiodarone administration. The patient's renal function remained stable, and he developed no signs or symptoms of digoxin toxicity. To our knowledge, no case reports have associated significant fluctuations of digoxin plasma concentrations that correspond to the timing of oral amiodarone administration. Tissue-to-plasma redistribution appears to be a possible mechanism for this interaction, with the most significant effect occurring 8-10 hours after amiodarone administration. Clinicians should be aware that digoxin plasma concentrations may not correlate with digoxin tissue concentrations in this setting. When a loading dose of oral amiodarone is required in a patient receiving digoxin, the digoxin dosage should first be reduced, and digoxin therapy should be adjusted based on signs and symptoms of digoxin toxicity.

Abstract: We report the case of a patient with genetically confirmed Brugada syndrome who presented with ST-segment elevation in the right precordial and inferior leads. The presenting arrhythmia was atrial fibrillation, which degenerated into ventricular fibrillation during intravenous amiodarone. A flecainide test was markedly positive. Four appropriate cardioverter-defibrillator discharges occurred during a two-year follow-up period after implantation of the device.

Abstract: Broad QRS complex tachycardia is tachycardia with widened QRS complex more than 12 s and caused by various mechanisms, either supraventricular or ventricular. It is important to differentiate between ventricular and supraventricular because it will determine treatment and prognosis of patients. We report a case which was referred to us and first diagnosed as ventricular tachycardia but happened to be atrial fibrillation with RBBB. On ECG examination we found irregular broad complex of tachycardia, RBBB, extreme right axis and heart rate 170-180 beat/minute. Intravenous bolus of 300 mg amiodarone was administered within 30 minutes and continued with 900 mg/24 hours. During administration of amiodarone, heart rhythm was converted to sinus rhythm with short PR interval (0.09 s), left axis deviation, and positive delta wave at lead V1. The final diagnosis of wolf-parkinson-white (WPW) syndrome was then confirmed.

Abstract: This is a case report of a male patient with nonischemic cardiomyopathy who had severely depressed left ventricular systolic function and functional class III congestive heart failure (CHF). He also had left bundle branch block (LBBB) and recurrent ventricular tachycardia (VT). Though the patient's CFH functional class improved after implantation of a transvenous biventricular ICD system, recurrent VT episodes required the initiation of amiodarone. After an improved condition for 28 months, recurrent VT episodes led to multiple consecutive ICD shocks, which constituted an electrical storm and a battery status of elective replacement indicator (ERI). The recurrent VT episodes were suppressed with intravenous amiodarone and lidocaine. As Radiofrequency ablation was declined by the patient, a new left ventricular (LV) lead was transvenously added, providing biventricular and dual site LV pacing. After this intervention the arrhythmia subsided and the intravenous antiarrhythmic medications were stopped. No episodes of sustained VT leading to ICD shocks were observed for the following 9 months. The events in this case suggest that dual site LV pacing with biventricular pacing could be an alternative strategy for the management of refractory VT.

Abstract: A 44-year-old man was treated with amiodarone for dilated cardiomyopathy. After 53 months, he developed amiodarone-induced interstitial pneumonia. Amiodarone treatment was terminated, and the patient was given corticosteroids. These treatments were effective. However, pneumonitis recurred whenever prednisolone was reduced to less than 5 mg per day. Considering the patient's background characteristics, we considered his body mass index (BMI, kg/m(2)) and found his to be high. When four additional patients with amiodarone pulmonary toxicity were reviewed at our institute, a correlation between BMI and the duration of shadow disappearance was found (R(2)=0.8695). Because amiodarone is lipophilic, the patient's high BMI might have influenced the repeated appearance of pulmonary toxicity.

Abstract: Polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) comprises a variety of different subforms. Two patients were admitted to our hospital and developed polymorphic VT under treatment with amiodarone. However, each of them turned out to have a very different form of the arrhythmia and therefore required a different therapeutic approach. The clinical decision-making required a distinction between the two forms, and the following therapeutic approach included terminating the administration of amiodarone in the first case and continuing administration in the other case. As the most common forms of polymorphic VT are described, it becomes clear that each different form should be identified because of the important therapeutic implications. In particular, the role of amiodarone can be quite different in the management of these different forms of polymorphic VT.

Abstract: Amiodarone is a class III antiarrhythmic medication used extensively to treat ventricular arrhythmias. It is pharmacologically classified as a cationic amphiphilic drug due to its polar and apolar components. During the past few years, amiodarone has proved to be an effective treatment therapy for patients with ventricular dysfunctions, regardless of the etiology, and in particular ventricular arrhythmia associated with Chagas disease. Nevertheless, despite its hemodynamic and electrophysiological benefits, amiodarone produces serious collateral effects such as a bluish skin discoloration, photosensitivity, thyroid dysfunction, corneal deposit, peripheral neuropathy, bone marrow suppression, hepatitis, heart blocks, pneumonitis, among others. The objective of this case report is to discuss one of the most serious complications related to amiodarone, pulmonary toxicity, which is described as a differential diagnosis for a chagasic patient that was on the waiting list for a heart transplant. Amiodarone pneumonitis is a relevant differential diagnosis for heart failure (HF) patients using amiodarone that are admitted to the emergency ward with dyspnea.

Abstract: This case demonstrates the use of Tc-99m HMPAO scintigraphy in amiodarone (AD)-induced lung toxicity. The aim of this presentation is also to discuss different scintigraphic modalities in the diagnosis and follow up in AD-induced lung toxicity.
A 77-year-old man, with a suspicious AD-induced acute lung toxicity, underwent Tc-99m DTPA aerosol inhalation scintigraphy and Tc-99m HMPAO scintigraphy.
Rapid alveolar clearance of Tc-99m DTPA was found during AD therapy and increased lung uptake of Tc-99m HMPAO was also demonstrated. These findings supported the diagnosis AD lung toxicity. After cessation of therapy, Tc-99m DTPA alveolar clearance was decreased. Although there was some decrease in L/H and L/B ratios of Tc-99m HMPAO after 3 weeks of stopping therapy, Tc-99m HMPAO uptake in the lungs was still continued. This finding may be the result of ongoing pulmonary inflammation as a result of the long half-life of AD.
Compared with Tc-99m DTPA aerosol inhalation scintigraphy, Tc-99m HMPAO scintigraphy may have a role in the diagnosis of AD lung toxicity. Nevertheless, there is a need for longitudinal studies investigating patients under AD therapy using follow-up Tc-9m HMPAO scintigraphy.

Abstract: The incidence of multifocal atrial tachycardia (MAT) is very low and accounts for less than 1% of supraventricular tachycardia in infants and children. In this report, the clinical characteristics, medical treatment and outcome of MAT in 2 children are described. The first patient presented with tachycardia and respiratory failure since the day after birth. First, he received amiodarone, propranolol, and digoxin and then amiodarone alone. The heart rhythm converted to sinus rhythm 2 weeks after hospitalization. Although nonsustained MAT was occasionally observed when the infant suffered from pulmonary infection, the frequency of recurrent MAT decreased as the infant grew up. The second patient was a 5-year-old girl. She had congenital heart disease with double outlets of right ventricle (DORV), patent ductus arteriosus, coarctation of aorta, and ventricular and atrial septal defects. She underwent total correction at the age of 4 years. MAT was noted 3 months after the operation with the presentation of congestive heart failure. The heart rate slowed down and returned to normal sinus rhythm within several hours after amiodarone use. The symptoms and signs of congestive heart failure also disappeared. The patient took amiodarone regularly, and no tachycardia was detected during the follow-up period. MAT is considered to be a relatively benign arrhythmia with likely good outcome if there is no severe underlying illness. It can be well controlled under appropriate drugs, and a long period of follow-up is suggested. If pharmacologic intervention is required, we suggest that amiodarone may be an excellent choice.

Abstract: Amiodarone pulmonary toxicity represents the most serious adverse reaction from amiodarone use. It remains underdiagnosed and can have a variable presentation. The elderly population is at increased risk for amiodarone pulmonary toxicity. Thus, clinicians should prescribe the lowest dosage possible in the elderly and have a low threshold to discontinue the amiodarone for anyone with unexplained fatigue, dyspnea, cough, or weight loss. We present the case of an 89-year-old female who presented with a several month history of fatigue and recent development of dyspnea on exertion and a dry cough. She had been taking amiodarone for 1 year secondary to atrial fibrillation. Chest x-ray and chest CT revealed multilobar airway opacities. An infectious work-up was negative and a transbronchial biopsy revealed prominent intra-alveolar foamy macrophages, consistent with amiodarone pulmonary toxicity. Despite the prompt discontinuation of her amiodarone and a trial of intravenous steroids, the patient succumbed to respiratory failure. The risk factors, clinical presentation, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of amiodarone pulmonary toxicity are discussed.

Abstract: The duration of the QT interval is influenced by many pathologic processes and drugs. We report a 74-year-old man who was admitted after syncope. His electrocardiogram (ECG) showed a QT interval of 0.44 s (QTc 0.53 s). After 10 h a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm was diagnosed and the patient underwent implantation of an aorto-bi-iliac Y-prosthesis. After surgery QT interval normalized. Under therapy with amiodarone, given because of atrial fibrillation, QT prolongation occurred again and disappeared after discontinuation of amiodarone. The postoperative course was complicated by critical illness polyneuropathy and plexopathy. Whereas amiodarone is a well recognized cause of QT prolongation, aortic aneurysm rupture has not been described previously. Vegetative mechanisms and sudden decrease of cardiac afterload due to the ruptured aneurysm may have altered myocardial repolarisation and thus prolonged QT interval duration. In conclusion in a patient with syncope and QT prolongation, extracardiac causes like rupture or an aortic aneurysm have to be included into the differential diagnosis.

Abstract: 50 years old female patient, with history of diabetes mellitus and hypertension, receiving metformin (500 mg BID) and atenolol (50 mg BID), presented to the Emergency Room with asthenia and dizziness. The patient was also receiving alternative medication (Dragon Blanco) which contains no licorice. During the emergency workup she developed syncope and three episodes of ventricular fibrillation. She was electrically defibrillated and treated with amiodarone and potassium replacement. The patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit. Physical exam: BP: 160/90 mm Hg, RR: 15, Pulse: 83: Cardiovascular: grade II systolic murmur which irradiated to the neck. The rest of the examination was unremarkable. Labs: Na: 138 meg/dl, K: 1.6 meg/dl, Cl: 84 meg/dl, BUN: 17 mg/dl, Creat.: 1.1 mg/dl, Gluc.: 148 mg/dl, Renin: < 0.15 mcgr/ml, Aldosterone: 20.1 mcg%. Aldosterone-Renin ratio: 133. Chest X-Ray: cardiomegaly. EKG: RBBB, long QT segment and prominent broad "u" waves compatible with severe hypokalemia. A CT SCAN of the Abdomen/Pelvis showed a 3.2 cm right adrenal mass, most likely adenomatous. The patient was discharged with the diagnosis of primary aldosteronism. Due to the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, hypertension and the three episodes of ventricular fibrillation, surgical treatment was postponed until stress tests and eventual coronary angiographic studies were performed. We found in our review of the medical literature 9 reports of fibrillation associated with hyperaldosteronism. Of those, only two were associated with primary aldosteronism, one of them with a fatal outcome. This case is highly unusual and emphasizes the importance of an adequate diagnosis of secondary hypertension.

Abstract: Ephedrine or ephedra herbal products have occasionally been used to enhance sports performance and energy or to aid weight loss. The most serious side effects are those on cardiovascular function, including acute myocardial infarction, severe hypertension, myocarditis and lethal cardiac arrhythmias.
A 19-year-old woman was taking ephedrine to enhance her sports performance. After 10 days of this medication she developed hemodynamically unstable ventricular tachycardia resistant to cardioversion and amiodarone treatment. She converted to sinus rhythm 60 hours later, presumably when the plasma ephedrine level had sufficiently decreased. In an electrophysiological study the ventricular tachycardia could be induced and successfully ablated. There were no recurrences during follow-up of more than a year. The use of ephedrine carries a risk of development of life-threatening arrhythmias.
Ephedrine alone cannot be considered as the ultimate cause of tachycardia in our patient; however, it is highly probable that ephedrine triggered the tachycardic attack. The proarrhythmic effect most likely occurred because of underlying idiopathic left ventricular tachycardia. Although the patient could have developed her first attack of ventricular tachycardia at any time in her life, it is highly improbable that the attack following the ephedrine abuse was purely coincidental.
Our experience with the reported patient shows that ephedrine alone, or in combination with substances that increase its effects on the cardiovascular system, may also trigger paroxysms of non-ischemic ventricular tachycardia. The use of ephedrine carries a risk of development of life-threatening arrhythmias and should be discouraged.

Abstract: Survival after prolonged cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is often associated with neurological and other sequelae. We describe a patient who survived prolonged cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation neurologically intact but suffered colon ischaemia and necrosis in the post-resuscitation period. Subtotal colectomy was performed. We wonder whether this complication was related to the use of vasopressin.

Abstract: To assess diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) among members of the Latin American Thyroid Society (LATS).
LATS members responded to an online questionnaire that presented an index case (a 62-year-old man on amiodarone, with thyrotoxic symptoms and a nodular goitre) and a variant (same patient, no goitre).
About 25% of invited members responded to the questionnaire. Most respondents lived in iodine-sufficient areas and observed that amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism (AIH) is more common than AIT. Nearly all assessed TSH, and the most used combination of tests was TSH and free T4 (37%). Thyroid autoimmunity was assessed by about 90%. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) was useful to 80%. Additional tests ordered for the index case were: radioactive iodine uptake (RAIU; 57%), echo-colour Doppler sonography (ECDS; about 50%) and fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB; 44%). For the variant, ECDS and RAIU were judged unhelpful by 16%. Most defined the index case as type I AIT and the variant as type II AIT, but 16% in LATS suggested a mixed form in the index case. As initial treatment, nearly all used thionamides in the index case [with potassium perchlorate (KClO(4)) in one-third], while glucocorticoids were indicated to the variant by 66%. Only about 5% considered amiodarone withdrawal unnecessary. If initial strategy is ineffective in type I AIT, KClO(4) (half) or glucocorticoids (a third) are added; in type II, glucocorticoids are indicated by most. Once euthyroidism is restored, ablative therapy is prescribed by a third of respondents for type I AIT.
There are several points of disagreement among thyroidologists regarding AIT management, mainly in the radiological evaluation and the approach to the already stabilized patient if amiodarone needs to be restarted.

Abstract: We describe the case of a 39-year-old man who experienced a ventricular fibrillation storm related to a prominent J wave in the inferior and lateral electrocardiographic leads on the day after gastrostomy. The J wave slowly decreased after amiodarone therapy (400 mg/day) was started, and ventricular fibrillation disappeared.

Abstract: A 54-year-old non-obese woman treated with amiodarone reported blurred vision and had bilateral optic disc edema with relative preservation of visual function. Neurologic examination, brain imaging, and lumbar puncture opening pressures were normal, effectively ruling out increased intracranial pressure. Amiodarone was discontinued and the optic disc edema completely resolved over 15 months. In the absence of alternative explanations for the optic disc findings, amiodarone toxicity is suggested.

Abstract: The short QT syndrome has been recently recognised as a genetic ion channel dysfunction. This new clinical entity is associated with an incidence of sudden cardiac death, syncope, and atrial fibrillation in otherwise healthy individuals. The distinctive ECG pattern consists of an abnormally short QT interval, a short or even absent ST segment and narrow T waves. A 30-year-old resuscitated woman with short QT syndrome is described together with an example of the classic ECG characteristics. A short-coupled variant of torsade de pointes was reveal on Holter recordings. The implantable cardioveter defibrillator seems to be the therapy of choice to prevent from sudden cardiac death. Quinidine proved to be efficient in prolonging the QT interval and rendering ventricular tachyarrhythmias non-inducible in patients with a mutation in KCNH2 (HERG). Our preliminary data suggest amiodarone combined with beta-blocker may be helpful in treating episodes of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia for patients with an unknown genotype. Because the short QT syndrome often involves young patients with an apparently normal heart, it is imperative for physicians to recognize the clinical features of the short QT syndrome in making a timely correct diagnosis.

Abstract: To describe the administration of amiodarone and the resulting serum concentrations in a neonate receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
A 3463 g, 38 week gestational age male diagnosed with tetralogy of Fallot developed junctional ectopic tachycardia (JET) and required ECMO support following cardiac surgery. The patient continued to show JET despite cooling, pacing, and intravenous amiodarone infusion, with the dose initiated at 10 microg/kg/min. Sinus rhythm was achieved following 5 days of treatment, additional amiodarone boluses, and an increase in the infusion rate to 20 microg/kg/min. Two serum concentrations of amiodarone were obtained during therapy. On day 4, the concentration was 0.9 mg/L at the 20 microg/kg/min infusion rate; a bolus dose of 5 mg/kg was administered 1 hour later. The serum concentration the following day, with the infusion rate unchanged, was 2 mg/L.
ECMO is used increasingly postoperatively in patients with congenital cardiac abnormalities. The incidence of JET following repair of tetralogy of Fallot is 22%. Despite the minimal information on the pharmacokinetics of amiodarone in neonates, it has been used in doses up to 20 microg/kg/min for the treatment of postoperative JET. As of August 25, 2006, we found no reports describing its dosage and use in patients undergoing ECMO.
The delivery of amiodarone to a patient receiving ECMO may be complicated by the administration of large blood volumes, circuit changes, and binding to the circuit. Neonates receiving ECMO may require larger amiodarone doses to achieve a therapeutic effect. Further investigation is required to define the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of amiodarone in neonates receiving ECMO.

Abstract: A two year-old female who had underwent ABO-incompatible heart transplantation at four months of age was admitted with unexplained anemia and renal dysfunction. The patient also had evidence of moderate liver dysfunction. Maintenance immunosuppression consisted of tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil and prednisolone. Tacrolimus was held on day 2 for five days because of an elevated trough blood concentration. The patient required one fourth of her maintenance dose to keep trough concentrations within the target range. Nadolol and amiodarone were prescribed on day 7 to control ventricular arrhythmias. Sirolimus was prescribed on day 11. A precautionary (non-steady-state) sirolimus trough concentration was grossly elevated. Sirolimus was held and tacrolimus was discontinued. Sirolimus blood concentrations remained above the target range for fourteen days despite successive dose manipulations. The patient succumbed from complications of ECMO on day 42. Amiodarone and cyclosporine interactions in the solid organ transplant population have been previously described. To our knowledge, there are no cases of amiodarone and sirolimus or tacrolimus interactions reported in English literature. Both tacrolimus and sirolimus are metabolized through the same enzyme system as cyclosporine, and the chance of a similar interaction occurring is high. Sirolimus is also a substrate of p-glycoprotein and thus may be significantly affected by amiodarone. We have described a potential interaction with sirolimus, tacrolimus and amiodarone. If amiodarone is deemed the most appropriate choice for the patient, clinicians should consider prospectively decreasing sirolimus and tacrolimus doses. Blood concentrations should also be monitored more frequently in order to minimize prolonged periods of supratherapeutic concentrations and related toxicities.

Abstract: A female patient was admitted to our Department for total thyroidectomy in amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis. The drug was prescribed for ventricular arrhythmia and atrial paroxysmal fibrillation in dilated cardiomyopathy due to chronic aortic regurgitation with left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction 35%; Class Functional NYHA III) and moderate-severe respiratory insufficiency. The cardiologist-anesthetist team has allowed to evaluate the surgical-cardiovascular-anesthesiologic risks and the balance between the improvement by the amiodarone administration for the arrhythmia, and the discontinuation of this treatment in order to prevent aggravation of the thyrotoxicosis. These hypotheses were subsequently discharged for the two reasons listed below: - several other antiarrhytmic drugs (that didn't show equivalent efficacy as amiodarone in preventing or converting such ventricular and atrial arrhythmias) may be proposed in the place of amiodarone. However, this could expose the patient to an arrhythmia; - a clear proof that the suspension of amiodarone can allow restoring normalization of the thyroid function doesn't exist. Therefore, the patient has been successfully submitted to the surgical intervention and in the follow-up we brought her back to a state of normalized thyroid function and cardiovascular conditions. In patients that cannot safely discontinue amiodarone or when medical therapy is ineffective in controlling thyrotoxicosis, thyroidectomy is the treatment of choice.

Abstract: Perioperative management of patients with cardiac pacemakers may be challenging because of the increasing sophistication of these devices. We report a case of a patient with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) and with a permanent AAIR (bipolar atrial-inhibited adaptive rate) pacemaker who suffered life-threatening episodes of arrhythmias during operation. The first episode was vagally induced PAF during bowel manipulation; the second, induced by the increased pacing threshold from the external electric cardioversion and hyperkalemia. Transcutaneous pacing provided cardiac pacing and stabilized the patient during the second episode. Thorough preoperative evaluation and prophylactic placement of temporary pacing or at least transcutaneous pacing are important for the avoidance and minimization of intraoperative complications in patients with sick sinus syndrome and with an AAI (atrial inhibited) pacemaker.

Abstract: This case report describes a Caucasian woman with an acute and reversible cardiomyopathy provoked by sudden emotional stress. Notable features of the case are the lack of neurohumoral activation, a 1-week delay between the identified emotional stressor and presentation, and the development of torsades de pointes with amiodarone therapy. Amiodarone should be viewed as contraindicated in this condition.

Abstract: Although there are two types of amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT), only type II AIT has been seen at our institution in Japan so far. There have been few case reports of AIT recurrence, probably because of the fact that amiodarone is immediately discontinued once AIT has developed. Our own policy is not to discontinue amiodarone in all AIT patients, unless severe adverse effects such as pulmonary fibrosis develop. Among more than 50 patients with type II AIT we have encountered, three with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy showed AIT recurrence. In these patients, the first episode of AIT developed 3, 4, and 2 years after the start of amiodarone administration, and recurrence was observed 5, 6, and 8 years after the first episode, respectively. The AIT resolved spontaneously in all cases while the patients continued to take amiodarone. In comparison with the first AIT episode, the second was milder and resolved within a shorter period. These three cases suggest that recurrence of type II AIT may not be rare in iodine-sufficient areas, and that it is relatively mild and may resolve spontaneously. Furthermore, at least in Japan, it may be possible for patients with recurrent type II AIT to continue taking amiodarone.

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease is the main cause of death after renal transplantation. There are few trials evaluating the efficacy of prevention strategies in renal transplant patients on major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and cardiovascular mortality. However, there is general agreement that active prevention strategies can significantly decrease cardiovascular mortality after renal transplantation. Here, we present the case of a 52-year-old male patient who received a first kidney transplant in 1993. He showed a small fixed perfusion defect on thallium scintigraphy before transplant. He was admitted at 13 months due to an antero-lateral myocardial infarction that was complicated with ventricular fibrillation. Despite anti-coagulation with acenocumarol, treatment with statins and angiotensin II receptor blocking agents and an excellent preservation of renal function, the patient presented with a second episode of myocardial infarction at 9 years post-transplant. This case report is discussed in order to highlight the way in which attitudes have been modified in the past decade in order to systematically pursue an early diagnosis of pre-existing coronary artery disease, aggressively treat MACE and actively decrease cardiovascular risk in transplant patients, using all available efficacious treatments as well as individualizing immunosuppression to prolong not only graft but also patient survival.

Abstract: Complementary medication is en vogue and an increasing number of patients consume herbal medicine without reporting their use to physicians. We report a case of iodine-induced hyperthyroidism due to the ingestion of a kelp-containing tea. A 39-year-old woman with multinodular goiter presented with typical signs of hyperthyroidism, which was confirmed by endocrine tests. She was not exposed to iodinated radiocontrast media and did not take medications containing iodine, such as amiodarone. However, a detailed medical history revealed that she had been treated for a period of 4 weeks by a Chinese alternative practitioner with a herbal tea containing kelp because of her enlarged thyroid. The consumption of the tea was discontinued and an antithyroid drug therapy was initiated. Physicians should advise patients with underlying thyroid disease to avoid all complementary or alternative medications containing iodine.

Abstract: Amiodarone is currently indicated for the treatment of life-threatening ventricular dysrhythmias. It is also used for the treatment of supraventricular dysrhythmias and as maintenance therapy after successful cardioversion of atrial flutter or atrial fibrillation. Adverse effects related to its expanded use are increasingly common. We describe a case of amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis occurring 5 months after cessation of therapy and discuss the pathophysiology and treatment of this disorder.

Abstract: Elevations in serum cardiac troponins are used to diagnose myocardial infarction caused by ischemic heart disease. Several other conditions result in elevated cardiac makers in the absence of significant coronary artery disease. While not commonly recognized elevations of troponin I (TNI) may be seen in patients with protracted arrhythmias. We describe three patients with prolonged tachycardia, heart rates of 200-260 beats per minute, who had elevated TNI (0.81-4.6 ng/ml) but no significant coronary artery disease. Two patients presented with ventricular tachycardia and one had an atrioventricular re-entrant tachycardia. None of the patients presented with symptomatic hypotension. Coronary angiography in all three patients did not demonstrate significant coronary artery disease. The finding of an elevated TNI level may be the result of tachycardia and not myocardial infarction related to ischemic heart disease.

Abstract: To refine the criteria for the diagnosis of amiodarone-related optic neuropathy by including a broader spectrum of clinical features, thus helping to differentiate this entity from nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy coincidentally affecting a patient taking amiodarone.
A retrospective case review of 22 patients who developed optic neuropathy while taking amiodarone, in whom other systemic causes were excluded.
We identified 3 groups of patients: those in whom a diagnosis of amiodarone-induced optic neuropathy seems probable (n = 14), those in whom an association with amiodarone optic neuropathy is indeterminate (n = 5), and those in whom the occurrence of nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy seems to be coincidental (ie, unrelated to amiodarone) (n = 3). We formulated specific diagnostic criteria for each of these categories.
We recommend a systematic approach that includes assessment of bilaterality, mode of onset, degree of optic nerve dysfunction, structure of the uninvolved optic disc in unilateral cases, and systemic toxic effects. Such well-defined diagnostic criteria can help the clinician in the treatment of patients with this disorder.

Abstract: Programmed upper rate pacing occurred in a patient with a rate-adaptive pacemaker when he was connected to a cardiac monitor in an emergency department. The tachycardia was mistakenly interpreted to be ventricular tachycardia and the patient received multiple DC shocks as well as intravenous amiodarone and sotalol, resulting in severe hemodynamic deterioration. It is important that physicians working in the hospital environment be familiar with this pacemaker-monitor interaction as the problem may be easily rectified by disconnecting the monitor or by reprogramming the pacemaker to a nonrate-adaptive pacing mode.

Abstract: Amiodarone is one of the most efficient and safe antiarrhythmic drugs in the treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF). Yet, though rare, proarrhythmic effects remain a clinical problem. We present three cases of amiodarone-associated "Torsade de pointes" tachycardia (Tdp) in patients treated concomitantly with heart rate controlling medication for AF. Amiodarone loading therapy was started for the treatment of tachyarrhythmic AF in all the three patients. All presented with a history of coronary heart disease, resulting in a severely reduced left ventricular ejection fraction in two patients. One received oral amiodarone loading, in the others, amiodarone was administered intravenously because of hemodynamically relevant AF episodes. Amiodarone therapy was combined with a heart rate controlling medication including a beta-blocking agent and digitalis in all the cases. All the subjects suffered from clinically relevant Tdp in the early run after initiation of amiodarone loading (max. 48 hours). The mean QTc in all patients before induction of Tdp was prolonged. The present case reports imply that amiodarone in combination with beta-blocker/digitalis therapy may be associated with an elevated proarrhythmic risk in selected patients with structural heart disease and AF.

Abstract: We here report a case of 71-year-old man with acute extensive anterior myocardial infarction, who was complicated with ventricular tachycardia (VT) even after successful percutaneous coronary intervention. As intravenous administration of nifekalant terminated VT, we started oral administration of amiodarone (day 1). We gave 400 mg of amiodarone a day for the first week and 200 mg a day from the second week. The patient was stable with normoxia by day 20, in spite of pulmonary congestion-like infiltrates on chest X-ray. On day 21, he was complicated with acute respiratory distress syndrome. Immediate discontinuance of amiodarone and high-dose pulse glucocorticoid therapy with intubation slightly improved the infiltrations on chest X-ray. However, glucocorticoid therapy induced hyperglycemia with an increase in plasma osmolality, complicated with hypoalbuminemia, and gastrointestinal bleeding. Despite treatment with a large amount of saline, high-doses of catecholamines, and blood transfusion, the patient died on day 28. It is sometimes difficult to diagnose congestive heart failure or amiodarone-induced pulmonary infiltrates in patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction.

Abstract: Amiodarone is increasingly prescribed for patients with ventricular and supraventricular tachyarrhythmias. Many adverse effects have been reported due to this drug and include injury to the liver, thyroid, cornea, skin, and neuromuscular system. Pulmonary toxicity is one of the more serious side effects of this anti-arrhythmic drug and is potentially fatal. Since the first case of amiodarone-induced pneumonitis was described in the early 1980s, amiodarone pneumonitis has been recognized as a distinctive and not uncommon form of drug-induced lung injury. On the other hand, amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity resulting in alveolar hemorrhage is rare. The authors report a patient with amiodarone-induced alveolar hemorrhage and review the literature.

Abstract: A cardiac transplant candidate with ischemic cardiomyopathy developed bilateral small parenchymal opacities in lower lobes of the lung. A fine-needle aspiration (FNA) was performed that revealed changes characteristic of amiodarone toxicity. Subsequently performed lung biopsies and electron microscopic studies confirmed the initial FNA diagnosis. The patient has been successfully transplanted with marked improvement in his clinical findings. This is the first case of amiodarone lung toxicity where the diagnosis was initially suggested based on the FNA findings. We also describe the clinical, cytological, histological, and electron microscopic (EM) findings of amiodarone-related pulmonary toxicity and provide a review of the literature.

Abstract: To describe the fifth reported instance, as of February 15, 2006, of a severe interaction between simvastatin and amiodarone and hypothesize inhibition of CYP3A4 as the major mechanism.
A 72-year-old white man (178 cm, 77.2 kg) with diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and mild azotemia was hospitalized on September 21, 2004, with thigh weakness, achiness, and dark urine for 7 days. Coronary artery bypass had been performed on July 7, 2004. Amiodarone 200 mg/day was started on July 10, and simvastatin 80 mg/day was initiated on August 13. Laboratory testing on the present admission included creatine kinase (CK) 19,620 U/L (reference range 60-224), blood urea nitrogen 50 mg/dL, creatinine 2.6 mg/dL, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 912 U/L (30-60), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 748 U/L (30-60), urine myoglobin 71,100 microg/L (<50), and serum myoglobin 13,877 microg/L (<110). Simvastatin and amiodarone were discontinued, and the patient was hydrated with forced alkaline diuresis. Thirteen days later, his CK was 323 U/L, creatinine 1.7 mg/dL, ALT 145 U/L, and AST 37 U/L.
Simvastatin is metabolized primarily by CYP3A4, and amiodarone is a recognized inhibitor of this enzyme. This may, therefore, account for the presumed drug interaction.
An objective causal assessment suggests that rhabdomyolysis, renal failure, and possibly hepatotoxicity were probably related to an amiodarone-simvastatin interaction.

Abstract: Snakebite is a common problem in rural areas of Asia. Russell's Viper toxicities are mainly bleeding disorder and nephrotoxicity. Cardiotoxicity is a rare manifestation of Russell's Viper's bite. A healthy man presenting with a Russell's viper bite developed cardiac arrest from ventricular tachycardia. He was successfully treated by cardiovertion and amiodarone. Subsequently, antivenom for Russell's Viper was administered for correction of a bleeding disorder

Abstract: It is hypothesized that intravenous (IV) amiodarone is poorly effective for the acute termination of sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia because of the relatively slow onset of its Vaughn-Williams class III effect to prolong myocardial depolarization and the refractory period. This study is designed to determine the effectiveness and safety of IV amiodarone for the termination of sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia.
A retrospective case series was collected at 4 urban university-affiliated hospitals from September 1996 to April 2005 after institutional review board approval with waiver of informed consent. Emergency department (ED) patients treated with IV amiodarone for ventricular tachycardia were identified by ED treatment and hospital pharmacy billing records, International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision discharge codes, and ECG characteristics. All consecutive patients who received at least 150 mg amiodarone in 15 minutes or less for spontaneous sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia were eligible for inclusion. Sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia was defined as a tachycardia with uninterrupted duration or rapid recurrence despite automatic internal cardiac defibrillator therapy for at least 5 minutes before amiodarone treatment, monomorphic morphology, rate greater than 120 beats/min, QRS duration greater than 120 ms, and subsequently determined to be ventricular tachycardia by ECG criteria (eg, atrioventricular dissociation), implanted device interrogation, or formal electrophysiology study. Measured outcomes included sustained termination of ventricular tachycardia within 20 minutes of initiation of amiodarone infusion and any documented adverse effects. Rates of successful termination and adverse effects and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. The presence or average values of potentially confounding predictors in patients with and without ventricular tachycardia termination after amiodarone were also calculated and compared.
Thirty-three patients were identified and included. Five patients received electrical therapy within 20 minutes of initiation of amiodarone infusion, and the response to amiodarone was unknown. Twenty-seven of the remaining 28 patients received 150 mg amiodarone, and the rate of successful ventricular tachycardia termination was 8 of 28, 29% (95% CI 13 to 49). Two of 33 patients, 6% (95% CI 1 to 20), required direct current cardioversion for presyncope or hypotension temporally associated with amiodarone treatment.
IV amiodarone, as currently administered, is relatively safe but ineffective for the acute termination of sustained ventricular tachycardia.

Abstract: Amiodarone (Cordarone; Wyeth, Ayerst, New York) is a potassium channel blocking antiarrythmal medication indicated for recurrent ventricular fibrillation and recurrent hemodynamically unstable ventricular tachycardia. Chemically, it is classified as an iodinated benzofuran derivate antiarrythmal drug not chemically related to any other available antiarrhythmic drug. Documented side effects of amiodarone include neurologic, gastrointestinal, dermatologic, cardiovascular, and ophthalmic. The ophthalmic abnormalities include optic neuropathy, optic neuritis, papilledema, corneal deposits, photosensitivity, lens opacities, and macular degeneration. Corneal microdeposits are seen in virtually all patients who receive amiodarone for more than 6 months. Corneal microdeposits result secondary to the secretion of amiodarone by the lacrimal gland with accumulation on, and absorption by, the corneal epithelium. Approximately 10% of these patients become symptomatic with glare and halos; however, that alone is usually not enough to precipitate intervention.
A 69-year-old woman presented to our office with a 2-week history of halos and glare in both eyes (OU). Her ocular history was significant for occasional contact lens wear. Her systemic history was significant for atrial fibrillation, for which she was taking amiodarone daily for the last 6 years. Six weeks before the onset of her chief complaint, her daily amiodarone dosage was increased from 100 mg to 300 mg. Ophthalmic examination found decreased visual acuities OU, amiodarone keratopathy (subepithelial verticillata), and diffuse corneal epithelial edema with diffuse sodium fluorescein staining OU. The corneal compromise was treated in 2 ways: the source medication was discontinued, and the ocular signs were medicated with a prophylactic topical antibiotic along with supportive preparations (tears/lubricants) and monitored over 2 weeks until full elimination of the pathologic signs and their symptoms. Even after complete resolution of the acute keratitis, the infiltrative keratopathy persisted along with the initial complaints of halos and glare. The supportive treatments were maintained over the course of 2 months until full recovery.
By exclusion, it was determined that the subepithelial depositions and cystic formations were secondary to an acute amiodarone dosage increase by a new practitioner. Prompt communication resulted in the physician discontinuing that medicine.

Abstract: A 49-year-old woman presented with chest pain of 10 days' duration. Initial physical examinations and laboratory investigations were normal. The patient received symptomatic treatment with beta-blockers, which continued following normal findings on coronary angiogram. About 7 months later the patient developed ventricular arrhythmias, with clinical evidence of left ventricular heart failure. Her arrhythmia symptoms persisted despite pharmacological therapy with atenolol, carvedilol and amiodarone.
Physical examination, electrocardiography, laboratory testing, serologic testing, exercise-tolerance testing, coronary angiography, chest radiography, cardiac MRI, tongue biopsy, bone-marrow biopsy, CT scan, iodine-123-labeled serum-amyloid-P-component scintigraphy.
Systemic primary amyloidosis (AL amyloidosis), with predominant cardiac involvement.
Pharmacological antiarrhythmic therapy and cardioverter-defibrillator implantation. Chemotherapy was planned but, despite intervention, the patient died before this treatment could begin.

Abstract: Thyroid hormone producing thyroid carcinoma is an uncommon cause of thyrotoxicosis. A patient with extensive hepatic metastases from well-differentiated carcinoma is presented. Administration of amiodarone for atrial fibrillation led to the development of hyperthyroidism. Precipitation of thyrotoxicosis by iodine-containing compounds in patients with thyroid carcinoma is rare. The relatively high iodine load and the slow elimination of amiodarone complicate the clinical management of such patients.

Abstract: Vortex keratopathy is characterized by bilateral symmetrical superficial corneal deposits in a vortex pattern. It is the most common ocular finding among patients being treated with amiodarone. An unusual case of unilateral amiodarone vortex keratopathy in an elderly woman with corneal dysplasia in the second eye is presented. The pathophysiology of amiodarone keratopathy is explored, and a cause for the unilateral keratopathy in this patient proposed.

Abstract: A 64 year old man receiving long term amiodarone treatment presented with dyspnea, cough, and weight loss. Radiographs and computed tomography showed a lung mass with associated multiple pulmonary nodules. Biopsies of the pulmonary mass showed foamy histiocytes without malignant cells. However, findings on FDG-PET scan were consistent with a malignant tumour. These findings on computed tomography and PET scan and the unusually late resolution of the pulmonary lesions after withdrawal of amiodarone treatment posed a challenging diagnostic problem.

Abstract: A 27-year-old pregnant woman was admitted with supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) and symptoms of heart failure. Echocardiography revealed pulmonary hypertension due to a tumour infiltrating the left atrium and compressing the pulmonary veins. After delivery by Caesarean section, the paroxysmal SVT was controlled by amiodarone. Thoracic CT scan showed mediastinal masses compressing the pulmonary arteries and veins, and a preliminary diagnosis of Hodgkin's disease was later confirmed by mediastinoscopy and lymph node biopsy. Following two courses of chemotherapy the masses diminished. The lumen of the left atrium increased, pulmonary hypertension and SVTs receded.

Abstract: We report a case of nonimmune hydrops fetalis detected at 32 weeks of gestation. Fetal heart rate was 300 beats per minute. Ultrasound and fetal Doppler echocardiography showed it to be due to supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). Following failed maternal therapy with digoxin alone, amiodarone with digoxin was used. Conversion to sinus rhythm and resolution of hydrops followed this treatment. Since there is no ideal treatment protocol for these cases at present, we reviewed reports of transplacental treatment of SVT.

Abstract: A 63-year-old man presented with ascites after therapy with amiodarone, 200 mg orally once per day for 22.5 months. A liver biopsy showed grade 3 chronic hepatitis and micronodular cirrhosis. The presence of striking microvesicular steatosis on light microscopy and lysosomal inclusion bodies on electron microscopy suggested amiodarone hepatotoxicity. This is the first reported case of amiodarone-induced hepatic cirrhosis associated with chronic treatment with 200 mg orally once per day for less than 2 years.

Abstract: Neurologic toxicity is an infrequently reported and under-recognized consequence of amiodarone, symptoms of which may include tremor, peripheral sensorimotor neuropathy, proximal weakness, and ataxia. The investigators report the rapid and complete remission of 4 months of progressively debilitating ataxia with the discontinuation of small-dose amiodarone in an elderly woman with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Despite the long half-life of amiodarone, her symptoms began to reduce after several days, and she was walking without assistance within 1 week. Wider recognition of this syndrome may avoid unnecessary and lengthy diagnostic evaluation and promote earlier neurologic recovery.

Abstract: Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) is the most common type of arrhythmia observed in children, especially in newborns. Infants with severe SVT must be treated immediately with first-line drugs such as amiodarone. There are some minor and major side effects of amiodarone in this patient group, but no associated electrolyte disorders have been observed. This report describes a newborn whose recurrent SVT attacks during amiodarone treatment were suspected to have been caused by hyperkalemia.

Abstract: Women with Fabry disease are considered to have a good prognosis. Here we report the clinical history of a female patient with severe Fabry disease before and after referral to our hospital. She was diagnosed to have a cardiac variant of Fabry disease since a left ventricular endomyocardial biopsy revealed specific features of this disease and that cardiac involvement was the sole manifestation. She developed sustained ventricular tachycardia and dilated cardiomyopathy requiring oral administration of amiodarone and a cardiac defibrillator implant.

Abstract: Hemodynamic improvement from biventricular pacing is well documented; however, its electrophysiologic effects have not been systematically studied. Sporadic case reports suggest a proarrhythmic effect of biventricular pacing resulting primarily in polymorphic ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation (VT/VF).
The purpose of this study was to report a series of patients in whom implantation of a biventricular system resulted in VT/VF storm with predominance of monomorphic VT.
In a retrospective analysis of all biventricular implants over a 4-year period at a single medical center, we identified 5 of 145 patients (3.4%) who developed VT/VF after they were upgraded to a biventricular system. All patients were male, age 71 +/- 8 years, with ejection fraction of 0.25 +/- 0.1. Four of five patients had ischemic cardiomyopathy.
All patients developed incessant VT/VF within 1 week of implantation. Monomorphic VT of single morphology was noted in 3 of 5 patients, monomorphic VT of multiple morphologies in 1, and polymorphic VT/VF in 1. VT was managed by temporary discontinuation of biventricular pacing in all patients, amiodarone in 3 of 5, sotalol in 1, and beta-blocker in 1. During 11 +/- 7 months of follow-up, 4 of 5 patients remain alive and are arrhythmia-free.
Biventricular pacing may result in precipitation of VT/VF storm in a minority of patients with prior history of VT/VF. This may be the first case series reporting both monomorphic and polymorphic VT after an upgrade to a system with biventricular pacing capabilities. The arrhythmias can be managed by conventional therapy and may require temporary discontinuation of left ventricular pacing. This observation is relevant to patients receiving a biventricular pacemaker without an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator backup.

Abstract: The anti-arrhythmic agent amiodarone (AD) is associated with numerous adverse effects, but serious liver disease is rare. The improved safety of administration of daily low doses of AD has already been established and this regimen is used for long-term medication. Nevertheless, asymptomatic continuous liver injury by AD may increase the risk of step-wise progression of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. We present an autopsy case of AD-induced liver cirrhosis in a patient who had been treated with a low dose of AD (200 mg/d) daily for 84 mo. The patient was a 85-year-old male with a history of ischemic heart disease. Seven years after initiation of treatment with AD, he was admitted with cardiac congestion. The total dose of AD was 528 g. Mild elevation of serum aminotransferase and hepatomegaly were present. Liver biopsy specimens revealed cirrhosis, and under electron microscopy numerous lysosomes with electron-dense, whorled, lamellar inclusions characteristic of a secondary phospholipidosis were observed. Initially, withdrawal of AD led to a slight improvement of serum aminotransferase levels, but unfortunately his general condition deteriorated and he died from complications of pneumonia and renal failure. Long-term administration of daily low doses of AD carries the risk of progression to irreversible liver injury. Therefore, periodic examination of liver function and/or liver biopsy is required for the management of patients receiving long-term treatment with AD.

Abstract: To describe a case of diltiazem-induced intestinal pseudo-obstruction in a neutropenic patient.
A 74-year-old male with newly diagnosed acute myelogenous leukemia developed atrial fibrillation on day 12 of induction chemotherapy. He was initially treated with diltiazem 5 mg intravenously every 5-10 minutes for 5 doses and an amiodarone 150-mg loading dose intravenously. Diltiazem 30 mg orally 4 times daily and amiodarone continuous infusion were started thereafter. Amiodarone therapy was discontinued after one day due to an untoward adverse effect. The diltiazem dose was then escalated. By day 14, the patient was receiving diltiazem 120 mg orally 4 times daily. On day 15, he developed increasing abdominal distention with hyperactive bowel sounds. On day 16, a radiographic examination showed multiple dilated loops of both the small and large bowel representing possible intestinal pseudo-obstruction; diltiazem was discontinued that day. Starting on day 18, the patient showed recovery of intestinal pseudo-obstruction without intervention. No further GI complications developed during his remaining hospital course.
Intestinal pseudo-obstruction is usually associated with underlying medical conditions such as trauma, infection, cardiac disease, and after surgery. Medications rarely cause such a condition. Detailed examination of the patient's record indicated neither infection nor other medications contributed to the development of intestinal pseudo-obstruction. Additionally, a radiographic examination ruled out neutropenic enterocolitis, a common gastrointestinal complication in neutropenic patients. Use of the Naranjo probability scale indicated a probable relationship between pseudo-obstruction and diltiazem in this patient.
Although calcium-channel blockers rarely cause intestinal pseudo-obstruction, clinicians must be aware of this serious but reversible adverse effect.

Abstract: A 47-year-old male had bilateral upper extremity thrombophlebitis after use of intravenous amiodarone for sustained ventricular tachycardia complicating myocardial infarction. Intravenous amiodarone has been widely used since it was introduced 20 years ago for severe intractable arrhythmias. Superficial thrombophlebitis was frequently noted in the early case reports when high-dose intravenous amiodarone was used. Superficial thrombophlebitis could extend hospitalization and become a significant source of distress to our patients. Some authors recommend insertion of a central line to administer intravenous amiodarone especially with expected extended use of therapy. The treating physician should be vigilant and switch from intravenous therapy to oral therapy as soon as the patient's condition stabilizes and oral therapy can be started.

Abstract: Acute peripheral arterial occlusion may be caused by thrombosis or embolism. The objectives of therapy are to preserve limb and life by restoration of blood flow. Thrombolytic therapy has been the mainstay, but is limited by a high risk of bleeding. Surgical treatment, often required, is invasive with higher rates of morbidity and mortality. Rheolytic thrombectomy offers a percutaneous means of thrombus removal. A 62-year-old man with chronic atrial fibrillation, idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, and hypothyroidism presented with sudden onset of left arm pain. His medications included warfarin, digoxin, amiodarone, and synthroid. Examination revealed a harsh 3/6 systolic nonradiating murmur. The left arm was cold and weak with absent pulses. Laboratory data showed a prothrombin time (PT) of 12 sec and an international normalized ratio of 1.4. After heparinization, angiography was performed, showing a total occlusion of the brachial artery. A rheolytic thrombectomy catheter (RTC) was introduced to remove the thrombus. The RTC run time was 90 sec. Flow was restored to the vessel, but sluggish with angiographic evidence of stenosis. Intravascular ultrasound was performed, revealing a high-grade fibromuscular stenosis. Balloon angioplasty was performed, followed by intracatheter injection of alteplase restoring normal flow. Sudden arterial occlusion is a medical emergency, which can result in limb loss. RTC's have demonstrated a reduced need for thrombolytic agents and surgical intervention, thereby decreasing complications, procedural time, and resource utilization. While most reports have focused on infra-aortic thromboses, this case highlights its utility in the arm.

Abstract: Speakers at the course were given vignettes describing one or more clinical scenarios on which to base their talks, selected because they represent common but challenging problems likely to be encountered by any physician practising in general internal medicine. Three of the subjects covered--weird thyroid function tests, difficult gout, and dementia--are presented here.

Abstract: Amiodarone is an effective antiarrhythmic agent that is widely used for tachyarrhythmias, especially ventricular tachycardia and supraventricular tachycardia. It has some mild short-term (e.g., skin rashes, gastrointestinal symptoms, and corneal microdeposits) and long-term side effects (thyroid dysfunction, visual disturbances, pulmonary infiltrates, ataxia, and hepatitis). We present two infants who had hyperglycemia following amiodarone infusion during the early postoperative period.

Abstract: Acute lung toxicity is a rare but classical complication of amiodarone therapy. We report the case of a patient who developed an optic neuropathy after 15 years of amiodarone administration, and who was treated for 2 weeks with steroids. Following withdrawal of steroids, the patient rapidly developed an acute respiratory distress syndrome. Postmortem lung histologic examination was consistent with amiodarone-induced pneumonitis. Since this complication is thought to be of immunological origin, we speculate that the sudden withdrawal of steroids was implicated in the development of the acute lung injury.

Abstract: Though cardiac involvement is a frequent finding in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) at the wheel-chair-bound stage, left ventricular hypertrabeculation (LVHT) has not been reported. The patient is a 28-year-old male with the typical clinical features of end stage DMD. Since the age of 16 years he required ventilatory support by means of non-invasive positive-pressure ventilation (NIPPV), initially intermittently and since age 27 permanently. Since the age of 21 years he developed chronic heart failure, and since age 24 atrial flutter, successfully treated with amiodarone. After discontinuation of amiodarone because of hyperthyroidism, he developed atrial fibrillation. Echocardiography at age 28 revealed mitral insufficiency, enlarged left atrial diameter, and, surprisingly, LVHT. Since LVHT was absent at the initial echocardiographic examination, it was regarded acquired. The case shows that cardiac involvement in DMD may not only comprise rhythm abnormalities, valve abnormalities, and dilative cardiomyopathy, but also LVHT in single cases.

Abstract: A case of ventricular tachycardia in a 37-year-old man after ingestion of heroin and cocaine, treated with naloxone is described. The arrhythmia is attributed to unopposed sympathomemetic effects of cocaine following administration of naloxone. The pro-rhythmogenic effects of naloxone may have contributed to the arrhythmia. He was initially treated sequentially with intravenous magnesium sulphate, calcium gluconate, sodium bicarbonate and lignocaine infusion, with no resolution of the ventricular tachycardia. He was admitted to the coronary care unit and was given an amiodarone infusion which converted the rhythm to sinus rhythm. Forensic physicians administering naloxone to poly-drug abuser in a custodial setting should be aware of potentially fatal consequences which they will be unable to detect. It is recommended that all such patients should be transferred to hospital for observation and investigation.

Abstract: Amiodarone, a benzofuran derivative, has been used therapeutically as an antiarrhythmic and coronary vasodilator in Europe since 1964. One of its commoner side effects is cutaneous photosensitivity; more rarely, after ingestion of the drug for around 12 months, a slate-grey or violaceous discoloration of sun-exposed sites may gradually develop. Both of these side effects usually resolve within 2 years of discontinuation of the drug. We now present a woman who developed both photosensitivity and a slate-grey discoloration whilst taking amiodarone; on discontinuation of the drug, the dyspigmentation gradually resolved, but the photosensitivity has persisted and the patient remains symptomatic more than 17 years later.

Abstract: After repair of an atrioventricular septal defect with common atrioventricular junction in a 2-month-old girl, rapid atrial tachycardia, in combination with junctional ectopic tachycardia, led to severe postoperative cardiovascular compromise. Intercurrent runs of ectopic atrial tachycardia made atrial pacing impossible, despite high doses of intravenous amiodarone. Following the addition of flecainide to the infusion, we were able to control the rhythm, and when combined with atrial pacing, this led to an immediate haemodynamic improvement. Treatment of refractory supraventricular tachycardias with amiodarone combined with flecainide can be very effective in the setting of postoperative cardiac intensive care.

Abstract: Acute burn and trauma patients have a higher frequency of cardiac arrhythmias than would be expected for noncardiac-hospitalized patients. Amiodarone is an effective, commonly used drug for cardiac arrhythmias in this patient population. We present a 54-year-old white man treated in the burn intensive care unit for 70% TBSA burns. The patient developed an acute increase in liver enzymes within days of starting intravenous amiodarone for the control of atrial fibrillation. A full radiologic hepatobiliary investigation did not reveal a source for hepatotoxicity. Discontinuation of amiodarone resulted in a rapid decrease in liver enzyme levels to baseline values. It is important to identify amiodarone as a potential cause of severe hepatotoxicity in burn patients, despite short duration of use and a low cumulative dose.

Abstract: An implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) has been implanted in a 69-year-old patient with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) for treatment of syncopal ventricular tachycardia (VT). Two types of ICD-related emergencies complicated the clinical course within 15 months. The first arrhythmic event occurred 3 months after ICD implantation as electrical storm with repetitive fast VT, resulting in 87 consecutive shocks at maximal output. Intravenous administration of amiodarone and reprogramming of the device were the measures to control VT. A year later, the patient experienced a cluster of 97 inappropriate shocks. Lead insulation failure produced electrical noise on the ventricular sensing channel and was misidentified as ventricular fibrillation (VF). The depleted ICD and the dual-coil lead were explanted and replaced by a new system. Multiple ICD shocks constitute a medical emergency in ICD patients, which requires immediate device interrogation for differentiation of appropriate and spurious discharges.

Abstract: Six horses without underlying cardiac disease were presented because of atrial fibrillation of between 5 and 12 months duration. These horses received an intravenous amiodarone treatment of 5mg/kg/h for 1 h followed by 0.83mg/kg/h for 23h and subsequently 1.9mg/kg/h for 30h. During treatment, clinical signs were monitored and a surface ECG and an intra-atrial electrogram were recorded. Infusion was discontinued when sinus rhythm or side effects occurred. Four horses successfully cardioverted, of which one showed symptoms of hind limb weakness and weight shifting. Two horses did not cardiovert and showed similar side effects. In all horses, side effects disappeared within 6h after termination of treatment. Cardiac side effects, such as pro-arrhythmia, were not seen in any of the horses. Total bilirubin slightly increased in three horses and normalised within four days. It was concluded that amiodarone has the potential to treat naturally occurring chronic atrial fibrillation in horses, although further research is needed to refine the infusion protocol.

Abstract: Atrial fibrillation in young patients without structural heart disease is rare. Therefore, when the arrhythmia is present in this population, reversible causes must be identified and resolved. Thyroid disorders, illicit drug or stimulant use, and acute alcohol intoxication are among these causes. We report the case of a 30-year-old Caucasian man who came to the emergency department in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. His medical history was unremarkable, except for minor fractures of the fingers and foot. Thyroid-stimulating hormone, magnesium, and potassium levels were within normal limits, urine drug screen was negative, and alcohol use was denied. However, when the patient was questioned about use of herbal products and supplements, the use of creatine monohydrate was revealed. The patient was admitted to the hospital, anticoagulated with unfractionated heparin, and given intravenous diltiazem for rate control and intravenous amiodarone for rate and rhythm control. When discharged less than 24 hours later, he was receiving metoprolol and aspirin, with follow-up plans for echocardiography and nuclear imaging to assess perfusion. Exogenous creatine is used by athletes to theoretically improve exercise performance. Vegetarians may also take creatine to replace what they are not consuming from meat, fish, and other animal products. Previous anecdotal reports have linked creatine to the development of arrhythmia. Clinicians must be diligent when interviewing patients about their drug therapy histories and include questions about their use of herbal products and dietary supplements. In addition, it is important to report adverse effects associated with frequently consumed supplements and herbal products to the Food and Drug Administration and in the literature.

Abstract: A premature neonate with hydrops was born at 32 weeks of gestation after successful direct fetal amiodarone therapy via cordocentesis for incessant supraventricular tachycardia. After birth the tachycardia could not be controlled despite high doses of amiodarone and flecainide and the patient developed severe respiratory and circulatory failure. After 3 weeks, weighing 2 kg, he underwent successful and uncomplicated catheter ablation of a left free-wall accessory pathway using low-energy radiofrequency.
radiofrequency catheter ablation is rarely used in neonates, but when used with caution may provide the optimal treatment.

Abstract: This report documents the occurrence of torsades de pointes (TdP) caused by marked QT interval prolongation in the case of a 71-year-old woman receiving both metronidazole and amiodarone for the treatment of pseudomembranous colitis and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. The case highlights a previously unknown drug interaction. The role of inhibition of cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 is discussed.

Abstract: Quinolone antibiotics have potentially serious proarrhythmic effects. The effects on intracardiac potassium channels result in QT interval prolongation, leading to torsades de pointes. Evidence suggests fluoroquinolones cause QT-mediated proarrhythmia, and weak evidence links ciprofloxacin with QT-mediated arrhythmias. Ciprofloxacin may be given to select patients because the agent is believed to be safer than other drugs in its class. We report two cases of unexplained cardiac arrest temporally related to ciprofloxacin administration. Two female patients (ages 44 and 67 years) developed marked QTc prolongation (QTc 590 and 680 ms) within 24 hours of ciprofloxacin administration, with recurrent syncope and documented torsades de pointes requiring defibrillation. The patients previously were stable with sotalol and amiodarone therapy for supraventricular arrhythmia without obvious QTc prolongation prior to ciprofloxacin therapy. Marked QTc prolongation and subsequent proarrhythmia became a clinical concern only after initiation of ciprofloxacin. In both cases, the QTc normalized after cessation of ciprofloxacin. Ciprofloxacin may cause QTc prolongation and rarely torsades de pointes. This effect is of particular concern in patients with predisposing factors, such as concomitant medications or underlying heart disease reflecting decreased repolarization reserve.

Abstract: The case of a 28-year-old man with recurrent syncope and multiple documented episodes of idiopathic ventricular fibrillation is reported. Recurrent syncope suggesting a self-terminating ventricular tachyarrhythmia occurred after 1 month of amiodarone therapy, and ventricular fibrillation was inducible at electrophysiologic study. After addition of quinidine, no significant ventricular arrhythmias could be induced. Similar results were found during a repeat electrophysiologic study performed 23.5 years later. During a 25-year period, the patient has remained arrhythmia-free on combined antiarrhythmic medication with quinidine and amiodarone.

Abstract: The popularity of amiodarone has grown due to its effectiveness in converting arrhythmia and its formulation availability. Formulations of the drug also contain iodine; the iodine content is 75 mg in a 200-mg tablet of amiodarone and 18.7 mg/ml in the intravenous solution. Approximately 10% of the iodine content of oral amiodarone is released into the circulatory system and may increase the risks of hypersensitivity reactions in iodine-sensitive patients. Documented allergies to contrast media or shellfish should not imply that a patient is allergic to iodine. Reactions to contrast media are likely due to the high osmolar or ionic content of the dye. The primary allergen in shellfish that stimulates allergic reactions is tropomyosin. Although amiodarone can cause thyroid disorders due to the high iodine load delivered to the body with each dose, no known association exists between amiodarone and reactions to contrast media or shellfish. Three patients whose medical charts listed an allergy to iodine were administered amiodarone for chemical cardioversion of arrhythmia to normal sinus rhythm. No anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reactions were observed in any of the patients during oral or intravenous amiodarone administration. In patients with true iodine hypersensitivity, however, the potential for such reactions exists.

Abstract: Amiodarone is a highly effective antiarrhythmic drug, albeit notorious for its serious pulmonary toxicity. The incidence of amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity (APT) appears to be 1% per year (1). We report a case of very acute APT in a man suffering from postoperative atrial fibrillation.

Abstract: A 60-year-old male patient with ischemic cardiomyopathy experienced an electrical storm 1 month after implantation of an internal cardioverter-defibrillator. Recurrent life-threatening episodes of ventricular tachycardia persisted despite maximal antiarrhythmic theraphy with amiodarone, metoprolol and mexiletine. After a total of more than 500 cardioversions, all antiarrhythmic medications were withdrawn, and the nonselective beta-blocker propranolol was initiated. Electrical stability was achieved and the patient was discharged on propranolol 400 mg/day. Two months later, a second arrhythmia cluster occurred that was controlled by the addition of amiodarone. The patient remains free of arrhythmia 15 months after the event with the combination of propranolol and amiodarone.

Abstract: Amiodarone represents an effective antiarrhythmic drug for cardioversion of recent-onset atrial fibrillation (AF) and maintenance of sinus rhythm. We briefly describe two patients suffering from recent-onset atrial fibrillation, who experienced an acute devastating low back pain a few minutes after initiation of intravenous amiodarone loading. Notably, this side effect has not been ever reported in the medical literature. Clinicians should be aware of this reaction since prompt termination of parenteral administration leads to complete resolution.

Abstract: Amiodarone, a class III antiarrhythmic, has been widely used to treat both ventricular and supraventricular arrhythmias. Despite the multitude of side-effects seen with this drug, no case of amiodarone anaphylaxis (confirmed by mast cell tryptase levels and skin testing) has been reported in the medical literature. We report a case of anaphylaxis to intravenous amiodarone in a 77-year-old patient.

Abstract: Atrial fibrillation is the most common arrhythmia after cardiac surgery. Amiodarone can effectively prevent and control postoperative atrial and ventricular fibrillation. Acute hepatic damage after intravenous amiodarone, which can be fatal, is not well recognized. We describe three cases of acute hepatocellular injury after intravenous amiodarone administration in critically ill patients. Another 25 published cases and six cases reported to the Swiss Pharmacovigilance Center (Swissmedic) are discussed.
This study consisted of a series of three case reports and review of the literature.
: This study was conducted at an operative critical care unit at the University Hospital Basel, Switzerland.
Three hemodynamically compromised patients after open heart surgery developed significant increases of transaminases (up to more than 100-fold of the upper limit of normal) shortly after the introduction of intravenous amiodarone. INTERVENTIONS AND MEASUREMENT: Cessation of intravenous amiodarone and of other potentially hepatotoxic drugs.
Liver parameters significantly improved or returned to normal in all three patients, even after start of oral amiodarone in two patients.
Amiodarone is a highly effective antiarrhythmic agent for the treatment and prevention of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. Acute liver damage after intravenous amiodarone, possibly induced by the solubilizer polysorbate 80, is rare but potentially harmful. Amiodarone loading should therefore be adapted to the necessity of an immediate effect of the drug, and liver function should be monitored closely in critically ill patients. Oral maintenance therapy with amiodarone is possible, even in patients who developed liver disease during intravenous loading.

Abstract: Congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS) is a disorder of prolonged cardiac repolarisation, manifest by a prolonged QT interval and characterised by recurrent presyncope/syncope, polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (PMVT), or sudden cardiac death. A 46 year old woman with no family history of sudden death or deafness presented with recurrent syncope. Physical examination and electrolytes were normal and a 12 lead ECG showed a corrected QT interval of 458 ms. A monitored syncopal episode documented PMVT. Despite potassium and magnesium supplements, beta blockade, implantation of a single then dual chamber implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), amiodarone, nicorandil, and mexiletine, the patient continued to experience arrhythmia storms, receiving more than 700 ICD discharges over seven months. She was ultimately treated successfully with bilateral thoracoscopic cervicothoracic sympathectomies. This is the first reported bilateral thoracoscopic treatment of a patient with LQTS and symptomatic life threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias refractory to current pharmacological and pacing techniques.

Abstract: Acute hepatic failure is a rare and potentially lethal complication of propylthiouracil (PTU) use for hyperthyroidism. We present a 20-year-old woman with Basedow-Graves' disease who developed PTU-induced fulminant hepatitis, which progressed to acute hepatic failure with grade III hepatic encephalopathy. Laboratory evaluation ruled out the most common causes of fulminant hepatitis. We treated her hyperthyroidism with amiodarone (average daily dose, 200 mg) for 3 weeks, achieving rapid and persistent euthyroidism, (triiodothyronine [T(3)] levels ranged between 64 and 109 ng/dL) without side effects. Amiodarone treatment did not abolish the thyroid radioactive iodine uptake (RAIU), allowing for subsequent treatment with radioactive iodine. The clinical course was favorable and the patient achieved full hepatic recovery 3 months after the hepatic failure was detected. After an extensive review of the literature, we believe that this is the first communication of the successful use of amiodarone to control hyperthyroidism in a patient with PTU-induced fulminant hepatitis.

Abstract: We report a patient with sotalol-induced torsades de pointes episodes that did not respond to magnesium and amiodarone. Electrical defibrillation totaling 15,120 joules had to be applied. However, torsades de pointes episodes could be brought under control only after the induction of general anesthesia with pentothal.

Abstract: To describe the clinical spectrum of amiodarone-associated optic neuropathy.
Observational cases series and review.
Of 55 cases, the median interval for onset of optic neuropathy was four months after initiating amiodarone; 88% occurred within 12 months. Seven (13%) patients were asymptomatic. Twenty-two (40%) patients presented with sudden visual loss, while 26 (47%) had insidious loss of vision. Visual acuity ranged from 20/15 to light perception; 10 (18%) patients had legal blindness with visual acuity of 20/200 or worse. Visual field loss was present in 91% of cases. Color vision loss was present in eight (40%) of 20 cases. Optic disc edema was present in 85% of cases, while eight (15%) patients had retrobulbar optic neuropathy, without evidence of disc edema. Optic disc edema resolved over a median time of three months. Five patients had raised intracranial pressure on lumbar puncture.
We were able to classify amiodarone-associated optic neuropathy into five clinical categories with respect to temporal characteristics and optic nerve appearance: insidious-onset (43%), acute-onset (28%), retrobulbar (13%), increased intracranial pressure (8%), and delayed-progressive onset (8%). Most cases of optic neuropathy commenced within 12 months of initiating amiodarone, with the median onset being four months. Over 10% of patients will have no visual symptoms at the onset. Ophthalmologic examinations within the first 12 months--and particularly within four months of initiating amiodarone--should improve early detection of amiodarone-associated optic neuropathy.

Abstract: Amiodarone use in the United States is increasing including a role in advanced cardiac life support protocols. There has been a significant increase in hypothyroidism, destructive thyroiditis (type II), and iodine-induced thyrotoxicosis (type I) with amiodarone. Preexisting thyroid disease and status of iodine intake can determine the nature of iodine-induced thyroid disease. Treating amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) may include traditional antithyroid agents, glucocorticoids, and surgery. Usually, it is assumed the radioactive iodine uptake (RAIU) will be low, and this choice as a treatment modality is excluded at the initial visit. We report a satisfactory outcome in a patient with AIT using radioactive iodine. The role of radioactive iodine in treating AIT is reviewed

Abstract: A 52 year old man was admitted to an emergency department with a fast ventricular rate atrial fibrillation after an electrical shock. Electrical cardioversion was attempted after echocardiographic examination. This failed, but the heart rate slowed. Successful pharmacological cardioversion was achieved after 16 hours of amiodarone infusion. Pre-excitation syndrome was detected on baseline echocardiograph. Serum cardiac specific markers were all within normal limits. No abnormal findings were detected by chest radiography, echocardiographic, or coronary angiographic investigations. Acute onset atrial fibrillation after electrical injury is discussed.

Abstract: Amiodarone-associated thyrotoxicosis (AAT) is often poorly tolerated owing to underlying cardiac disease, and it is frequently refractory to conventional medical treatment. The goal of this study was to describe the patient characteristics, management, and outcomes of all the patients treated surgically for AAT at a single institution. We conducted a retrospective chart review of all patients managed surgically for AAT (April 1985 through November 2002) at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. Altogether, 29 men and 5 women, ages 39 to 85 years (median 60 years), treated with amiodarone for 3 to 108 months underwent near-total or total thyroidectomy. Frequent symptoms were worsening heart failure, fatigue, weight loss, and tremor. Altogether, 12 patients failed medical management of their AAT, and 21 received no preoperative medical therapy. One patient had been successfully managed medically but required definitive treatment. Common indications for operation were the need to remain on amiodarone, cardiac decompensation, medically refractory disease, and severe symptoms, both hyperthyroid and cardiac, necessitating prompt resolution. The median+/-SD American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification (1 = healthy through 5 = moribund) was 3.00+/-0.58. A total of 27 specimens had histology consistent with AAT. Complications included death (n = 3), rehospitalization (n = 3), symptomatic hypocalcemia (n = 2), pneumonia (n = 2), cervical hematoma (n = 1), prolonged ventilatorywean (n = 1), and stroke (n = 1); one patient developed hypotension, adult respiratory distress syndrome, and sepsis. Of the 31 surviving patients, 25 (80%) remained on amiodarone postoperatively. The median follow-up was 29 months, at which time all surviving patients were free of hyperthyroid symptoms. Thyroidectomy is an effective treatment for AAT but has a high incidence of perioperative morbidity and mortality. The cardiovascular co-morbidities and high operative risk in this group of patients may account for the increased complication rate.

Abstract: A 75-year-old man suffered sustained ventricular tachycardia with syncopal attack. Ventricular tachycardias appeared repeatedly, and an electrical defibrillator was used after an anti-arrhythmic drug, such as lidocaine or mexiletine, proved ineffective. The tachycardias had multiple origins, and the signal-averaged electrocardiogram (SAECG) showed ventricular late potential before the administration of amiodarone. After administration, the filtered QRS and duration of the late potential increased, but the recurrence of tachycardias was suppressed. The reason for this is thought to be that amiodarone blocked the sodium channel and delayed conduction, consequently blocking reentry, because amiodaron has antiarrhymic properties with a prolongation of refractoriness and minimal effect on conduction velocity in ventricular myocardium, and inhibits sympathetic activity, and blocks L-type calcium channel besides the depression of the fast sodium channel. In this case, SAECG predicted to some degree whether or not this patient's ventricular tachycardia would respond to amiodarone.

Abstract: Primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1) is a rare autosomal metabolic recessive disease, caused by the deficiency of the liver peroxysomal alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGT), characterized by accumulation of calcium oxalate crystals in kidneys and others organs. We present the case of an elderly woman with PH1, presenting as acute renal failure. Precipitation of calcium oxalate crystals was probably due to amiodarone-induced severe hypothyroidism. Residual AGT activity is associated with the G170R (G630A) mutation. A new mutation of AGT, called R36C, was also discovered; the role of this new mutation is actually not known.

Abstract: A 52-year-old male with ischemic cardiomyopathy and severe ventricular dysfunction underwent coronary artery bypass grafting and left ventricular reconstruction (Dor operation). The patient developed acute onset of incessant ventricular tachycardia in the early postoperative period that was refractory to therapy with class I antiarrhythmic agents, and multiple attempts at electrical cardioversion were required. A combination of intravenous nifekalant hydrochloride and enteral amiodarone was elected as treatment for this recurrent incessant ventricular tachycardia. Nifekalant hydrochloride was administered as a loading dose (0.3 mg/kg/5 min), followed by an intravenous infusion (0.4 mg/kg/hr). Several days after initiating therapy, the patient no longer experienced episodes of ventricular tachycardia, and there was no compromise in hemodynamics. We conclude that nifekalant hydrochloride is a useful agent for suppression of ventricular tachycardia in patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction, especially during the early postoperative period.

Abstract: Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD) is underdiagnosed cardiomyopathy which commonly presents in young adults with ventricular tachycardia or sudden death. We report a case of ARVD presenting with features of acute coronary syndrome. The suspicion of ARVD came only when echocardiogram revealed abnormal shape and wall motion of right ventricle, which was later confirmed by right ventricular angiogram. The diagnosis of ARVD was discussed and the literature reviewed.

Abstract: Supraventricular tachycardia with rapid ventricular response is well recognized as the more frequent cause of single chamber ICD inappropriate therapies. We report here a 18-year-old-woman with surgically corrected transposition of the great arteries who received repetitive inappropriate discharges from an ICD implanted for ventricular tachycardia. Rapid atrial activity during episodes of supraventricular tachycardia with high degree atrioventricular block was oversensed as ventricular fibrillation by a single chamber ICD causing repetitive painful discharges. Pharmacological treatment of the supraventricular tachycardia solved the problem.

Abstract: A number of reports have raised the possibility that myocardial strain could be associated to increased plasma levels of troponin I. A 69-year-old, male, Caucasian, patient was admitted with prolonged chest pain and dyspnoea. The electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation with a ventricular rate of about 120 to 150/minute. After treatment with digoxin and amiodarone, the patient returned to sinus rhythm. An elevation in the plasma levels of troponin I was noted, with a maximum value of 0.66 ng/ml. Coronary angiography showed absence of coronary artery atherosclerotic lesions. Atrial fibrillation of recent onset and with a relatively high heart rate may be yet another situation in which acute myocardial strain could be the cause of the abnormal release of cardiac troponin I.

Abstract: Amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) is a well-known complication of amiodarone treatment found in 3% to 12% of patients. Two types of AIT have been described, each associated with a distinct histologic pattern of thyroid involvement. Type 1, which typically develops in the background of pre-existing thyroid disease, is due to iodine-induced excess thyroid hormone synthesis, whereas type 2 is due to destructive thyroiditis. The prevalence of thyroid cancer in patients with AIT is unknown. We report a case of papillary thyroid carcinoma associated with type 2 AIT.

Abstract: We describe a case of amiodarone induced hyponatremia consistent with the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) that developed during amiodarone loading, similar to three prior reports. The hyponatremia improved after a lower maintenance dose was initiated. This episode was reported online to the FDA (http://www.fda.gov/medwatch), and future amiodarone labeling will include SIADH as a potential side effect (personal communication, Wyeth Medical Science). Clinicians should be aware of this rare but serious complication, especially in light of the neurological effect of profound hyponatremia. Amiodarone induced SIADH may develop during the loading phase, and may respond to dose reduction without termination of drug.

Abstract: This case report describes a patient with a sustained monomorphic VT after surgical repair of a tetralogy of Fallot (TOF). In combination with the three-dimensional electroanatomic mapping system, CARTO, and conventional mapping techniques the VT was identified as a macro-reentrant tachycardia circling around the border between pulmonary graft and right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT). A y-shaped ablation line crossing this zone was created. The VT terminated during RF application and was not inducible again. This case underlines the use of a combined conventional and three-dimensional electroanatomic mapping technique can be helpful for catheter ablation of ventricular arrhythmias in TOF patients.

Abstract: Amiodarone is an iodine-rich drug used to treat cardiac dysrhythmias. The structure of amiodarone resembles that of thyroxine, and treatment with amiodarone may alter thyroid function. The effects of antenatal amiodarone use on fetal/neonatal thyroid function have only been addressed in a limited number of patient reports. We describe two cases of transient neonatal hypothyroidism due to in utero amiodarone exposure, followed by a brief review of the available literature.

Abstract: The objective of our study was to evaluate the usefulness of steroids therapy for patients who underwent surgery for chronic atrial fibrillation, with histologic findings of myocarditis.
Between April 1991 and July 2002, 144 patients underwent surgery for chronic atrial fibrillation at the time of other cardiac operations, at the Department of Cardiovascular surgery of the University of Bologna. Fragments of left and right appendages were provided for each patient for histologic study: In three patients myocarditis was identified and they were treated with steroid therapy until the postoperative day 60. We report here the case of our first successfully treated patient with a longer follow-up time.
The patient was discharged on postoperative day 30, in sinus rhythm. At follow-up, 9 months after surgery, she was doing well and working full time; the ECG showed sinus rhythm, and echocardiography demonstrated biatrial contraction.
According to our experience, the histologic diagnosis of myocarditis allowed us to modify the therapeutic approach in patients who underwent surgery for atrial fibrillation, in which the addition of steroids to antiarrhythmic therapy, in the early postoperative period, is able to induce the recovery of sinus rhythm.

Abstract: To report a case of severe myopathy associated with concomitant simvastatin and amiodarone therapy.
A 63-year-old white man with underlying insulin-dependent diabetes, recent coronary artery bypass surgery, and postoperative hemiplegia was treated with aspirin, metoprolol, furosemide, nitroglycerin, and simvastatin. Due to recurrent atrial fibrillation, oral anticoagulation with phenprocoumon and antiarrhythmic treatment with amiodarone were initiated. Four weeks after starting simvastatin 40 mg/day and 2 weeks after initiating amiodarone 1 g/day for 10 days, then 200 mg/day, he developed diffuse muscle pain with generalized muscular weakness. Laboratory investigations revealed a significant increase of creatine kinase (CK) peaking at 40 392 U/L. Due to a suspected drug interaction of simvastatin with amiodarone, both drugs were stopped. CK normalized over the following 8 days, and the patient made an uneventful recovery. An objective causality assessment revealed that the myopathy was probably related to simvastatin.
Myopathy is a rare but potentially severe adverse reaction associated with statins. Besides high statin doses, concomitant use of fibrates, defined comorbidities, and concurrent use of inhibitors of cytochrome P450 are important additional risk factors. This is especially relevant if statins predominantly metabolized by CYP3A4 are combined with inhibitors of this isoenzyme. Amiodarone is a potent inhibitor of several different CYP isoenzymes, including CYP3A4.
Avoiding the concomitant use of drugs with the potential to inhibit CYP-dependent metabolism (eg, amiodarone) or elimination of statins may decrease the risk of statin-associated myopathy. Alternatively, if drug therapy with a potent CYP inhibitor is inevitable, choosing a statin without relevant CYP metabolism (eg, pravastatin) should be considered.

Abstract: Thyrotoxicosis is a well-documented and studied complication of treatment with amiodarone, but little has been written about the risks and treatment of recurrent thyrotoxicosis upon re-exposure to amiodarone. One such case is outlined here and discussed by a panel of experts.

Abstract: We report the case of a 58-year-old man who suffered from a generalized and intolerable itching one month after starting treatment with colchicine, amiodarone, perindopril, allopurinol and spironolactone. From the start of treatment he had progressively developed erythroderma, fever, anorexia and prostration, oedema of both hands and face, hypereosinophilia (42%; 5810 eosinophils/mm3), hepatic failure (including cholestatic jaundice, cytolysis, coagulation abnormalities and hypoproteinaemia), exocrine pancreatic failure (with severe steatorrhoea), renal failure, metabolic acidosis, aggravation of pre-existing cardiac insufficiency and oedema of the lower extremities. All medications were stopped and the condition improved slowly until complete remission was reached 4 months later. Patch-testing was performed, including the various drugs. All the tests (including components of the vehicles) were negative, except for spironolactone, which gave a strong positive reaction. Ten controls in healthy volunteers were negative. The diagnosis of drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) induced by spironolactone was made. This is the first report of DRESS due to spironolactone.

Abstract: Many patients with cardiac arrhythmias require concomitant therapy with warfarin and amiodarone. Beyond the predictable pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction requiring a significant warfarin dose reduction, the iodine-rich amiodarone affects the thyroid gland, causing overt hypothyroidism or thyrotoxicosis in 14%-18% of cases. In turn, thyroid disorders may affect warfarin sensitivity, with hypothyroidism and thyrotoxicosis resulting in increased or decreased warfarin requirements, respectively. We describe 3 patients on concomitant amiodarone and warfarin who developed amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis heralded by a significant decrease in warfarin requirements. We review the literature on the mechanisms of the complex drug-drug and drug-disease interactions within the thyroid gland, warfarin, and amiodarone triad. Given that significant thyroid disorders may be only mildly symptomatic and thus may escape clinical detection, we suggest that thyroid function should be tested in any patient with otherwise unexplained changes in warfarin dose requirements, particularly if concomitantly treated with amiodarone.

Abstract: A 76-year-old man underwent an emergency laparotoray for a ruptured abdominal aortic ancurysm After a few days he presented ischemia of the left side of the colon and subsequently atrial fibrillation developed that was treated with Amiodarone. After an intravascular loading dose of 300 mg, he received a maintenance dose of 600 mg daily through a central line access. After 28 days of intravascular drug therapy, a chest X-ray showed a high attenuation homogeneous image in the right part of the mediastinum. A contrast enhanced thoracic and abdominal computed tomography scan showed: a high attenuation intravascular mass in the superior vena cava around the catheter. The catheter was substituted but the intravascular mass remained. The Amiodarone was then given by mouth. The mass spontaneously decreased its size and after three months completely disappeared Due to high iodine content, any deposition of Amiodarone can be detected by a radiological study as a high attenuation image. After reviewing all the drugs infused through the catheter, we did not find any other drugs that contain iodine or other material that could justify the chest X-ray image. We hypothesized that this intravascular mass was due to a deposition of the Amiodarone during the infusion in the central line

Abstract: A forty-one-year-old male, with no risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD) and with moderate alcohol intake, was admitted in 1992 to Portalegre Hospital with heart failure due to viral cardiomyopathy. He was re-admitted in 1998 with acute pulmonary edema and was put on mechanical ventilation for 48 hours, and transferred to Pulido Valente Hospital when stable. The physical exam was without abnormalities. ECG showed first degree AV block, left ventricular hypertrophy and 2 mm ST depression in the precordial leads. The echocardiogram revealed left ventricular dilatation and depressed systolic function. Coronary angiography showed single-vessel CAD and coronary artery anomaly. Dobutamine stress echocardiography was halted due to hypertension, making it impossible to evaluate ischemic response. Holter monitoring showed five-complex ventricular tachycardia. The patient was discharged medicated with amiodarone, with indication for cardiac scintigraphy and electrophysiological study.

Abstract: Granulomas in the bone marrow are usually caused by infectious or hematological diseases, and drugs are only rarely implicated as causative agents. Recent reports have drawn attention to the role of amiodarone in the etiology of bone marrow granulomas. We report two cases of amiodarone-induced bone marrow granulomas in patients being investigated for refractory anemia and pancytopenia, respectively. Since both patients had life-threatening arrhythmias, discontinuation of the drug followed by rechallenge was not possible. Both patients did well in spite of continued amiodarone therapy, indicating that the underlying hematological illnesses were unrelated to the granulomas. Amiodarone should be considered as a possible cause of bone marrow granulomas after the exclusion of other causes. Continued use of amiodarone after granuloma formation must be dictated by the underlying cardiac condition.

Abstract: A 60-year-old man with polyarteritis nodosa under treatment presented with syncope. Echocardiography demonstrated hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy; coronary arteriography revealed normal findings, and Holter monitor showed episodes of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. This is the first report of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy developing in a patient with polyarteritis nodosa. Further studies should examine whether a true association exists.

Abstract: Arrhythmias are the most common major complications encountered during pediatric cardiac catheterizations. This report describes the management of repetitive paroxysms of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias triggered by catheter manipulation during interventional procedures in two children. After 15 minutes, amiodarone infusion (25 microg/kg/min) eliminated further paroxysms in both patients, allowing both interventions to be completed safely and effectively.

Abstract: We report the case of a patient in whom transvenous left ventricular pacing lead placement at the time of a biventricular upgrade led to an exacerbation of clinical monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (MVT). At implant, slow left ventricular pacing repeatedly induced sustained MVT. However, testing of the biventricular pacing showed no MVT inducibility, and the system was implanted. The patient was readmitted due to multiple episodes of the MVT observed at implant. The MVT was controlled with pharmacotherapy, allowing the patient to continue with biventricular pacing.

Abstract: Interstitial pneumonitis is a rare disease that is seen in the context of some infections (e.g. PCP and CMV pneumonia), as side-effects of drugs (e.g. beta-blockers, amiodarone) and rarely in the context of renal transplantation. It manifests itself usually as a pneumonic illness; with symptoms of dyspnea, cough, fatigue and sometimes fever. Characteristic radiological changes are bilateral lower zone haziness. Interstitial pneumonitis is now emerging in solid organ transplant patients secondary to sirolimus). We describe three cases of sirolimus-induced pneumonitis in two patients who started sirolimus to permit cyclosporin withdrawal and in one patient initially started on sirolimus. The presentations in these cases ranged from insidious to fulminant; there was a rapid response to sirolimus withdrawal. This is an important syndrome, with an unknown frequency.

Abstract: Amiodarone is recommended by the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation and has been adapted by the Resuscitation Council (UK) and the Advanced Life Support Group for use in paediatric advanced life support and advanced paediatric life support for the treatment of refractory supraventricular tachycardia. The International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation has stated that resuscitation guidelines should be evidence based. We present a case report of a cardiovascularly stable infant with supraventricular tachycardia who had a variety of arrthymias requiring cardiopulmonary resucitation for a prolonged period of time after loading with intravenous amiodarone. We believe that this report, together with other evidence, may suggest caution with the use of amiodarone.

Abstract: We describe a 70-year-old Caucasian man with recurrent history of blistering of peri-oral skin during summer months. Following the diagnosis of a phototoxic reaction to Amiodarone, this was discontinued and an alternative drug to control his cardiac arrhythmia was prescribed. His peri-oral lesions rapidly resolved, and there has been no further recurrence. A brief review on photosensitivity and the underlying mechanisms are discussed.

Abstract: A 67-year-old man was transferred to hospital because of acute circulatory failure resulting from sustained left ventricular tachycardia (LVT) and dysfunction. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed severely impaired left ventricular contraction and dyskinesis of the apical wall. Neither anti-arrhythmic agents nor direct current cardioversion was effective; the patient was resuscitated by immediate use of percutaneous cardiopulmonary support and intraaortic balloon counterpulsation. Ventricular contraction returned to normal following restoration of normal sinus rhythm with amiodarone and cibenzoline. The pathogenesis of LVT accompanied by transient ventricular dyskinesis is discussed with regard to the efficient use of a mechanical circulatory support system in resuscitation.

Abstract: Dengue fever is a viral infection transmitted by the mosquito, Aedes aegypti. Cardiac rhythm disorders, such as atrioventricular blocks and ventricular ectopic beats, appear during infection and are attributed to viral myocarditis. However, supraventricular arrhythmias have not been reported. We present a case of acute atrial fibrillation, with a rapid ventricular rate, successfully treated with intravenous amiodarone, in a 62-year-old man with dengue hemorrhagic fever, who had no structural heart disease.

Abstract: We report three consecutive hydropic fetuses with fetal tachyarrhythmias treated with amiodarone-two in combination with digoxin and one with digoxin, procainamide, and propranolol. Sinus rhythm was achieved in one case and ventricular rate control was achieved in two cases. All fetuses treated with amiodarone gradually improved. Observed side effects of amiodarone were a maternal rash in one mother and transient neonatal hypothyroidism in one infant. We conclude that amiodarone might be effective and safe for fetal tachyarrhythmias and impending hydrops. The small number of patients suggests that a multicenter cooperative approach is required in order to determine if this is correct.

Abstract: Amiodarone can cause thyroid dysfunction in patients with or without previous thyroid disease. With increased use from its placement in advanced cardiac life support guidelines and cardiac transplant programs, the incidence of amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) will likely increase. Medical management is complex and nonuniform and frequently fails. This study investigates the role of surgery in AIT and proposes indications for surgical management.
Two AIT case reports at a tertiary care institution and 31 surgical AIT cases in the world literature are reviewed.
The 2 AIT cases involved patients with cardiomyopathy and resistant arrhythmias. Despite medical therapy, both patients' conditions failed to improve. Thirty-one surgical cases of AIT in the literature are evaluated with respect to symptoms and onset, medical therapy, AIT classification, pathology, perioperative management, and complications.
Both patients underwent total thyroidectomy without difficulty or complication, one as an overnight stay and one as an inpatient with an intraaortic balloon pump. One patient received a successful cardiac transplant and the other remains a viable candidate. In the literature, the majority (80%) of surgical cases are AIT type II (less common type) with no underlying thyroid disease. Range and duration of symptoms varied, in addition to type and duration of medical management. Almost all patients underwent total thyroidectomy, and all were successful with no mortality and minimal morbidity.
AIT can develop in any patient during or after amiodarone therapy. Medical management is extremely difficult due to the absence of a proven therapeutic armamentarium, and surgery offers a safe, viable option. Surgical management should play a larger role in treatment algorithms and should be strongly considered for patients whose conditions necessitate continuation of amiodarone, or with severe symptoms resistant to medical therapy.

Abstract: Idiopathic ventricular tachycardia is rare, especially in infants. We report here on an 8 month-old female infant who presented with tachycardia with a heart rate of 186 beats/ min. An electrocardiogram showed a right bundle branch block pattern, a QRS duration of 80 msec, a superior QRS axis, atrioventricular dissociation, and occasional fusion and capture beats. Suspected ventricular tachycardia was treated with lidocaine, propranolol and amiodarone, but in vain. The tachycardia was terminated and well controlled with the use of verapamil. According to an electrocardiogram and her clinical response, verapamil-sensitive idiopathic ventricular tachycardia was diagnosed with the arrhythmic origin in the left posterior fascicle.

Abstract: A 69 year old female with history of coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation suffered from occipital apoplexy. Under treatment with amiodarone 600 mg daily and concomitant medication with beta-acetyldigoxine (0.1 mg daily) and bisoprolole (1.25 mg daily), significant QT-prolongation (max. 700 ms; QTc: 614 ms) could be documented. Out of normofrequent sinus rhythm but as well out of bradycardia, the patient developed repetitive short-lasting "torsade de pointes" tachycardias (320 bpm) which terminated spontaneously. Serum electrolytes, plasma levels of digoxine (1.76 ng/ml) and amiodarone (1.9 mcg/ml) were within therapeutic range. This case report is the first to describe induction of amiodarone-associated "torsade de pointes" tachycardia during concomitant beta-blocker and digitalis medication in a patient with atrial fibrillation and structural heart disease. This points towards an elevated risk for proarrhythmia under this triple therapy.

Abstract: A 44-year-old woman with restrictive cardiomyopathy showed right-sided dominant heart failure after conversion to sinus rhythm from paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF). During cardiac catheterization, the hemodynamics were compared before and after cardioversion; that is, with AF and with sinus rhythm. The hemodynamic parameters worsened after conversion to sinus rhythm, with a significant decrease in heart rate, but improved with atrial pacing. Pacemaker implantation was performed to avoid bradycardia while keeping the sinus rhythm with amiodarone. As a result, the patient has been free from symptoms of heart failure for almost 1 year and her serum brain natriuretic peptide level also improved remarkably.

Abstract: The congenital form of His bundle tachycardia is an uncommon pediatric arrhythmia. We report the case of a 7-year-old child with tachycardiomyopathy. The incessant arrhythmia, detected in infancy, was resistant to amiodarone and beta-blockers. During electrophysiologic study, the tachycardia converted to sinus rhythm with intravenous adenosine and diltiazem. Subsequently, the child is maintaining sinus rhythm on oral verapamil. Calcium-channel blockers should be considered for the treatment of this arrhythmia, which is often resistant to multiple antiarrhythmic drugs.

Abstract: Electrical storm is defined as a recurrent episode of hemodynamically destabilizing ventricular tachyarrhythmia that usually requires electrical cardioversion or defibrillation. We describe three cases presenting with electrical storm under differing circumstances: (1) a 57-year-old man with ST-elevation myocardial infarction within 1 week of a posterior circulation stroke who developed refractory sustained ventricular tachycardia 10 days after an acute myocardial infarction; (2) a 65-year-old man who developed polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation following dobutamine echocardiography; and (3) a 20-year-old woman who developed intractable ventricular fibrillation following an overdose of a weight-reduction pill. The management of electrical storm is discussed, and evolving literature supporting the routine use of intravenous amiodarone and beta-blockers in place of intravenous lidocaine is critically examined.

Abstract: Beta-blocker therapy is now standard therapy for patients with stable heart failure; however, fluid-overloaded, New York Heart Association Class IV patients tolerate beta-blockers poorly. Amiodarone, a drug with antiadrenergic effects, has been shown to improve survival for patients with heart rates of 90 beats per minute or greater.
We reviewed 26 patients with severe decompensated heart failure who were started on oral amiodarone for heart rate control. beta-Blocker titration was attempted when patients became clinically stable.
The mean age of the patients was 48.5 +/- 17.5 years, and 73% were male. Fifteen patients were New York Heart Association Class IV, and 11 were Class III. Of these, 23 (88%) were fluid-overloaded, and 11 (42%) were on inotropic agents when amiodarone was started. The mean ejection fraction was 16.1 +/- 6%. The initial dose of amiodarone was 346 +/- 120 mg/day. Twenty (77%) patients were successfully started on beta-blockers. At follow-up prior to beta-blockers, 20 (77%) patients improved by at least one New York Heart Association class. Heart rate decreased from a mean of 98 +/- 15 to 78 +/- 13 beats per minute (P <.0001). Echocardiograms were available in 12 patients, with ejection fractions increasing from 16.1 +/- 8% to 26.8 +/- 13% (P =.004).
Amiodarone may be an effective rescue therapy for patients with decompensated heart failure and serve as a bridge to subsequent beta-blocker therapy.

Abstract: Non-melanotic discoloration of the skin can result from the accumulation of various internal agents (ingestion, inhalation, or injection), chemicals or drugs, such as heavy metals, amiodarone, tetracycline, clofazimine and others, or exogenous (topical) substances. Identifying the causative agent frequently requires a thorough investigation and clever detective work, including visits to the home and workplace. It is, however, rare that the patient presents at a clinic with the corpus delicti, and it is even more rare when neither the patient nor the treating physician are initially aware of it.

Eckermann in Converstions with Goethe, May 18, 1824.]

Abstract: Ventricular tachycardia is rare in children. In the absence of structural heart disease, ventricular tachycardia is known as idiopathic ventricular tachycardia and carries a good prognosis. We report a 14-month-old male child with right bundle branch block incessant ventricular tachycardia without structural heart disease. In this patient ventricular tachycardia was controlled by amiodarone and disappeared during follow-up. We want to stress the benign nature of this tachycardia if the previous treatment protocol had been appropriate.

Abstract: Amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity has been described mostly in patients receiving large doses of the drug over prolonged periods. In this report, we describe the early onset of acute pulmonary toxicity leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome after a short course of amiodarone treatment following middle-lobe non-small-cell lung cancer resection.

Abstract: The potential for development of 2 to 1 atrioventricular conduction in children with prolongation of the QT interval has been previously reported secondary to electrolytic disturbances. We report here a child who developed 2 to 1 atrioventricular conduction with prolongation of the QT interval following treatment with amiodarone for refractory supraventricular tachycardia. We highlight the importance of electrocardiographic monitoring to assess for those at risk of amiodarone toxicity, which may be manifested by prolongation of the QT interval and the simultaneous loss of atrioventricular conduction, and of equal importance the need for prompt conversion to an alternative anti-arrhythmic agent.

Abstract: Evolving pacemaker and device technology now allows the onset pattern of arrhythmias to be identified. It is recognised that some cardiac arrhythmias have a circadian pattern of onset and that ventricular arrhythmias can occur in clusters of electrical storms. The long-term follow-up of patients with an atrial defibrillator suggests that in some patients persistent atrial fibrillation recurrences are not random, but can occur in clusters of 'atrial fibrillation storms'. A case report is used to demonstrate this newly recognised phenomenon.

Abstract: A two-month-old child having WPW syndrome and orthodromic tachycardia was on treatment with digoxin, flecainide and amiodarone. Despite this, he continued to have severe, very frequent episodes of tachycardia. The left-sided accessory pathway was hence ablated via a patent foramen ovale.

Abstract: A 41 year old woman with type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidaemia but no known heart disease received 130 DC shocks for repeated cardiac arrests due to ventricular tachyarrhythmias over 48 hours. She was stabilised by intravenous amiodarone and had a defibrillator implanted. Serial ECGs did not change, but raised troponin I confirmed myocardial infarction as the underlying cause. Electrical storm is an uncommon and dramatic but usually treatable syndrome of recurrent ventricular arrhythmias. Frequent precipitants of electrical storm include recent worsening heart failure, hypokalaemia, hypomagnesaemia and myocardial ischaemia. Amiodarone is the antiarrhythmic agent of choice and implantable cardioverter defibrillator improves long term outcome.

Abstract: Drug-induced lupus is not a very common entity. Drugs like hydralazine, procainamide have been reported to induce lupus, but so far there is no case report of amiodarone-induced lupus in Indian literature. A case of atrial fibrillation in an elderly man who came with systemic features of lupus after amiodarone therapy for one and half years is reported.

Abstract: This case refers to a 39-year-old woman with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and family history of sudden death (SD). In 1985, high rate atrial stimulation induced VF. In 1996 an ICD was implanted and she remained without arrhythmic events until November 2000 when the device reported one episode of atrial fibrillation degenerating into VF and terminated by the ICD. The VF induction mechanism recorded by the ICD was similar to that observed in 1985. The high incidence of atrial tachyarrhythmias in HCM renders cases like this at higher risk of SD. The predictive role of incremental atrial stimulation merits highlighting in future studies.

Abstract: Torsades de pointes (TdP) has not been previously reported with loratadine. A 73-year old woman on chronic treatment with amiodarone for atrial fibrillation received loratadine and presented with syncope and multiple episodes of TdP. We suggest that QT interval should be monitored whenever loratadine is co-administered with drugs that may potentially prolong QT.

Abstract: A 72-year-old woman who was experiencing incessant ventricular tachycardia and recurrent automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator (AICD) firing despite amiodarone therapy was referred to the Cleveland Clinic Foundation. Myocardial ischemia and infarction were ruled out by standard means. Several antiarrhythmic medications were tried previously without success. Moricizine, 200 mg three times daily, was initiated and controlled the ventricular tachycardia. However, after the dose of moricizine was titrated upward, the patient became symptomatically bradycardic and the ECG exhibited 2:1 block of her paced rhythm and an increased ventricular pacing threshold.

Abstract: This study presents a patient with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy who had suffered from multiple ICD shocks. Amiodarone and a beta-blocker failed to suppress ventricular tachycardia. His ECG showed a very wide QRS complex with an intraventricular conduction delay, so biventricular (BV) pacing was attempted. The BV pacing successfully prevented the multiple ICD shocks accompanied with an improvement in left ventricular systolic function and physical activity.

Abstract: The authors present a case of early (within 4 days) development of torsade de pointes (TdP) associated with oral amiodarone therapy. Consistent with other reports this case of TdP occurred in the context of multiple exacerbating factors including hypokalemia and digoxin excess. Transient prolongation of the QT during bladder irrigation prompted the episode of TdP. It is well known that bradycardia exacerbates acquired TdP. The authors speculate that the increased vagal tone during bladder irrigation, a vagal maneuver, in the context of amiodarone therapy resulted in amiodarone-induced proarrhythmia. In the absence of amiodarone therapy, a second bladder irrigation did not induce TdP despite hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia.

Abstract: Tachycardia with a wide QRS complex is usually due to ventricular tachycardia (VT), supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) with aberrant intraventricular conduction, or an accessory pathway-mediated dysrhythmia. The most common type of accessory pathway causing a wide complex tachycardia is the atrioventricular bypass tract. Distinguishing the accessory pathway-mediated tachycardia from VT or SVT with aberrancy is often difficult, but has important clinical consequences. This article will review the diagnosis of wide complex tachycardia due to an accessory pathway and its related management in the emergent setting.

Abstract: There have been few reports of the use of extracorporeal life support (ECLS) to provide cardiac support in children with low cardiac output as a result of arrhythmias. We present two patients in whom venoarterial ECLS was used to provide support for cardiogenic shock secondary to intractable supraventricular tachycardia. In both cases, the arrhythmia terminated once bypass was established. In one case, the time on ECLS was used to optimize drug treatment, and in the other case, radiofrequency ablation was successfully undertaken during ECLS.

Abstract: To determine the clinical features of amiodarone induced optic neuropathy, which may help distinguish it from non-arteritic anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy.
Retrospective observational case series of patients diagnosed with amiodarone induced optic neuropathy at the neuro-ophthalmology service from March 1998 to February 2001. Amiodarone was discontinued after discussion with the patient's cardiologist. Visual acuity, colour vision, automated perimetry, and funduscopy were performed on initial and follow up examinations.
Three patients with amiodarone induced optic neuropathy presented with mildly decreased vision, visual field defects, and bilateral optic disc swelling. Upon discontinuing the medication, visual function and optic disc swelling slowly improved in all three patients.
Amiodarone induced optic neuropathy can present with visual dysfunction, and is typically a bilateral process. Upon discontinuation of amiodarone, slow resolution of optic disc swelling occurs and visual function improves in some patients.

Abstract: Amiodarone is a commonly used anti-arrhythmic in elderly patients. Abnormal liver function is frequently reported with its use but clinically symptomatic disease is rare. Hepatomegaly, cholestasis, acute hepatitis and rarely fulminant liver failure have been recorded [1, 2], however amiodarone toxicity presenting with cirrhosis is exceedingly rare. Toxic effects of amiodarone are well described with higher dosage but severe hepatic toxicity and cirrhosis with low dose amiodarone has not been reported in the English language literature. We present a report on a patient with pseudo-alcoholic cirrhosis with low dose amiodarone.

Abstract: A 44 year-old man with severe left ventricular dysfunction resulting from an old myocardial infarction developed clusters of ventricular fibrillation (VF). Although coronary bypass surgery was performed and heart failure was well controlled, the VF recurred during amiodarone therapy. Despite multiple deliveries of shocks by an implantable cardioverter defibrillator, the electrical storm could not be terminated. Some substrate for rapid ventricular tachyarrhythmias, refractory to class III drugs, can lead to death from arrhythmia.

Abstract: Thyroid disorder is a well-recognized side effect of amiodarone therapy. Thyrotoxicosis is less common than hypothyroidism. Hypokalemic periodic paralysis is one manifestation of thyrotoxicosis, and is more often seen in Oriental and Latin American men than in other demographic groups. This phenomenon, however, has not been previously described in thyrotoxicosis due to amiodarone usage. We describe a case of amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis in a 34-year-old man who presented with sudden lower extremity weakness, heat intolerance, and weight loss. Physical examination demonstrated fine tremors. Serum potassium level was 2.2 mEq/L on admission. Gastrointestinal and renal causes of potassium loss were excluded by history and physical examination. Further biochemical testing demonstrated abnormal thyroid function. The urinary potassium and serum bicarbonate, magnesium, and calcium levels were within normal limits. Lower extremity weakness resolved immediately after potassium replacement therapy. Methimazole therapy was initiated, and the patient was clinically euthyroid on discharge.

Abstract: To present a patient with pneumoconiosis who developed a complex, life-threatening atrial tachyarrhythmia during anesthesia. Intravenous diltiazem was effective in controlling the ventricular rate and hemodynamics after failure of other antiarrhythmic drugs and direct current cardioversion.
A 79-yr-old man with pneumoconiosis complicated by cor pulmonale suffered from gout-related cellulitis of the left lower limb. Debridement of the left gangrenous big toe was carried out under general anesthesia. During anesthesia, a wide-QRS tachycardia occurred suddenly and a complex atrial tachyarrhythmia was later diagnosed. Hemodynamics deteriorated despite aggressive treatment with lidocaine, verapamil, direct current cardioversion, magnesium, digoxin and amiodarone. Correction of the underlying respiratory acidosis was not sufficient to control the rapid ventricular response. Eventually, iv diltiazem adequately controlled the rapid ventricular rate and quickly improved the deteriorating hemodynamics.
Life-threatening complex atrial tachyarrhythmias may occur in patients with chronic lung diseases perioperatively. Intravenous diltiazem was effective in the management of complex atrial tachyarrhythmia in a patient with underlying cor pulmonale.

Abstract: We describe a case of acute hepatitis after a loading dose of intravenous amiodarone. An 83-year-old woman was admitted in emergency for recent-onset atrial fibrillation associated with left ventricular failure. Twenty-four hours after having started parenteral amiodarone, she developed biochemical alterations indicative of severe hepatic cytolysis associated with impairment of the synthetic capacity which rapidly reverted after suspension of the drug. No clinical sign or symptom of hepatopathy was noted except for mild icterus. A review of the literature regarding amiodarone-related hepatotoxicity is reported.

Abstract: Amiodarone can cause the development of thyroid dysfunction in patients with or without previous thyroid disease. Although most cases of amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) are mild, a significant number become life threatening. Because of its pharmacokinetics, simply discontinuing amiodarone provides no relief and can worsen the patient's condition. Medical management frequently fails, and many patients cannot discontinue amiodarone because of its effect against resistant arrhythmias.
This retrospective chart review of a case at a tertiary care institution presents the case of a fifty-five-year-old male with dilated cardiomyopathy and no previous thyroid disease. The patient was in normal sinus rhythm on amiodarone for control of atrial fibrillation. He experienced the acute onset of symptoms with return to atrial fibrillation resistant to cardioversion. Physical examination, laboratory tests, and imaging findings were all consistent with a diagnosis of AIT. An attempt to withdraw amiodarone resulted in severe ventricular tachyarrhythmias.
Despite medical treatment, the patient's condition continued to deteriorate. Because amiodarone was the only effective drug, surgical treatment was elected. The patient underwent a total thyroidectomy and experienced no difficulties or complications. Postoperatively, the patient's condition improved, and he was successfully cardioverted.
Although an uncommon clinical entity, life-threatening AIT has been reported. Thyrotoxicosis can develop in any patient during or after amiodarone therapy. Medical management of this entity is extremely difficult because of the lack of a proven, consistent therapeutic armamentarium. Surgical management should be considered for patients whose conditions necessitate the continuation of amiodarone or those with severe symptoms resistant to medical therapy.

Abstract: Medications that act on the central nervous system are frequently used in people infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Actually, drug interactions are an important factor in the treatment of patients with (HIV) infection and because of the complexity of the current drug regimens, clinicians should be trained in order to recognize and manage drug interactions. Herein, we present an HIV infected male admitted for manic behavior and treated with risperidone who developed a profound coma secondary to increased levels of risperidone because of a possible drug interaction with ritonavir and indinavir. Subsequently, we discuss this interaction, rarely described in the literature. Risperidone is a cytochrome P450 (CYP2D6) enzyme substrate and weak inhibitor and a CYP3A4 substrate. Possible interactions with CYP2D6 inhibitors (amiodarone, fluoxetine or ritonavir) and CYP3A4 inhibitors (indinavir and ritonavir) can increase its serum concentrations and produce significant adverse effects. In conclusion, this drug combination should be administered with caution and routinely examined for signs and symptoms of risperidone toxicity. Dosages should be reduced as needed. Finally, we think that in patients taking multiple medications, plasma levels of risperidone should be monitored especially if drug interactions are possible.

Abstract: Amiodarone is one of the most effective antiarrhythmic drugs available and is widely prescribed despite several potentially life-threatening side-effects. Hepatotoxicity is the most frequent one during long-term oral therapy: occasionally acute hepatitis necessitates the suspension of treatment but monitoring of a transient increase in serum aminotransferases is usually sufficient; the clinical-morphological pictures of liver cirrhosis have also been reported. Fulminant hepatitis soon after a parenteral load of the drug is far less well described in the literature. Most published cases were reversible after the suspension of treatment. A negative challenge after oral amiodarone exposure suggested that polysorbate 80, a solvent added to the intravenous infusion and already implied in the pathogenesis of a similar syndrome observed in infants, is a more likely cause of this complication. The occurrence of acute hepatitis complicating parenteral amiodarone treatment does not preclude subsequent oral use of the drug: an evidence-based therapeutic behavior now definitively consolidated. Because of the rarity of this diagnosis, we report 3 cases of short-term hepatotoxicity secondary to amiodarone treatment for supraventricular tachyarrhythmias: in 2 male patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and in a female with liver disease. The diagnosis was presumptive and based on a thorough drug history, the temporal relationship, the time-course of liver dysfunction, the exclusion of other causes and on the rapid improvement observed after parenteral amiodarone withdrawal in 2 cases; in no case could we find any other explanation for the liver damage. Since amiodarone is sometimes still an irreplaceable antiarrhythmic drug, we raise the question of whether careful and continuous vigilance should be mandatory in patients receiving the drug or whether it is possible to introduce a pharmaceutical preparation not containing the vehicle that induces acute liver toxicity.

Abstract: We present three patients with variant angina pectoris and episodes of cardiac arrest. All of them had typical clinical symptoms, ST-segment changes in electrocardiogram, and coronary artery spasm confirmed by arteriography. They were treated with high doses of calcium antagonists and nitrates. An automatic cardioverter-defibrillator was implanted in the patient who developed ventricular fibrillation despite therapy with calcium antagonists. In another patient a DDD pacemaker was implanted because of high-degree atrioventricular block.

Abstract: Amiodarone is a benzofuran derivative used to treat cardiac arrhythmias. The most-common ocular symptom is colored rings around lights. Common ocular findings include comeal micro-deposits and lens opacities. An amiodarone optic neuropathy has been described. Digoxin is a cardiac glycoside used to treat cardiac arrhythmias and heart failure. It is known to cause dyschromatopsia, visual disturbances, and visual-field defects. Digoxin serum levels and toxicity risks increase with the addition of amiodarone.
Soon after initiation of amiodarone HCl (200 mg/day), a 76-year-old man came to us with symptoms of visual "shining," glare, color vision anomalies, and gradually decreased vision. Best-corrected visual acuity was 20/50 O.D. and 20/60 O.S. Ishihara color plates showed a marked, acquired color vision defect O.D., O.S. Biomicroscopy revealed amiodarone corneal deposits. The optic nerve appeared healthy, with no visible swelling in each eye. Amiodarone was discontinued after discussion with the cardiologist. On followup, the patient reported disappearance of symptoms. Visual acuity had improved to 20/30(+2) O.D. and 20/30 O.S. Ishihara color plates showed normal color vision.
As the elderly population and the incidence of heart disease increase in the United States, more people will probably be using heart drug therapy. Our case presents some of the challenges involved with managing ocular toxicity of these cardiac drugs. While both amiodarone and digoxin can cause permanent visual changes, the ocular effects are often reversible. Therefore, ocular examination at baseline and every 6 months is indicated for patients receiving a regimen of amiodarone and/or digoxin therapy.

Abstract: Two patients with amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity (APT) showed abnormally increased serum SP-D concentrations, although their KL-6 level was within the normal range. In a 59-year-old man with ischemic heart disease, APT progressed rapidly and required steroid pulse therapy. During the clinical course, SP-D was as high as 375 ng/ml, although the KL-6 level was only 289 U/ml. In a 58-year-old man treated for dilated cardiomyopathy, SP-D increased to 289 ng/ml, while KL-6 remained at less than 500 U/ml. These cases indicate that SP-D is a useful and early diagnostic marker for APT even when KL-6 is not elevated.

Abstract: The tissue distribution of amiodarone and desethylamiodarone, its active metabolite, was examined in an autopsied case, an 85-year-old man, with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) who had been receiving amiodarone for 4 years. High concentrations of amiodarone, a very highly lipophilic compound, were found in adipose and bone marrow tissues. Despite a low dose (100 mg daily), the concentrations of amiodarone were higher in the epicardial fat (570.4 microg/g) and in the right atrium (165.3 microg/g) than previously reported in patients with other cardiac diseases. The ratios of amiodarone/ desethylamiodarone concentrations in both tissues were >1. This unique distribution demonstrates the involvement of histological characteristics of ARVC, such as fatty replacement of myocardium. We anticipate that a low dose of amiodarone would be effective in preventing arrhythmia in some patients with ARVC.

Abstract: The syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH), the most common cause of euvolemic hyponatremia, is due to nonphysiologic release of arginine vasopressin from the posterior pituitary. Hyponatremia induced by SIADH can be caused by several conditions, such as central nervous system disorders, malignancies, various nonmalignant lung diseases, hypoadrenalism, and hypothyroidism. A 67-year-old man developed hyponatremia consistent with SIADH. Although common comorbid conditions associated with SIADH were excluded as possible causes, his medical history and drug regimen were extensive. However, he had been taking spironolactone, amiodarone, and simvastatin for less than 3 months. Amiodarone was discontinued based on a case report suggesting that this drug can cause SIADH-induced hyponatremia. The patient's serum sodium level began to rise within 3 days of discontinuation and returned to normal within 1 month. Although SIADH-induced hyponatremia occurs only rarely, it should be recognized as a possible adverse effect of amiodarone.

Abstract: Amiodarone is an effective antiarrhythmic agent for life-threatening arrhythmias but has some noncardiac toxicity. The syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) induced by amiodarone during long-term therapy seems to be rare among adverse effects.
We report on two elderly cases that developed hyponatremia caused by SIADH occurring during the initial loading period of amiodarone therapy. Both cases improved within 3 weeks after reduction of the dose, although amiodarone was continued.
Amiodarone-induced SIADH may occur during the initial loading period, and it may be improved by reduction of the dose without discontinuation of the drug.

Abstract: We describe herein the cases of 2 patients who had ventricular arrhythmias. In one, a short-term biventricular assist device, the ABIOMED BVS 5000, was placed because the patient had sustained ventricular tachycardia and could not be weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass. Excellent hemodynamic support was maintained for several days while the antiarrhythmic therapy was maximized. Sinus rhythm was restored, and the patient was successfully weaned from the ventricular assist device. However, the substrate for the arrhythmia persisted, and a recurrence, 1 week later, resulted in the patient's death. In the 2nd patient, the use of an implantable left ventricular assist device was successful in temporarily alleviating the ventricular tachycardia associated with ischemic cardiomyopathy. However, after 2 days of device assistance, the patient experienced a recurrence of the tachycardia, which degenerated into ventricular fibrillation with a marked deterioration in the patient's hemodynamics. The arrhythmia persisted despite multiple attempts at external cardioversion, and internal cardioversion and placement of an automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator were necessary. This treatment, along with repeated boluses of amiodarone, led to successful suppression of the arrhythmias, and the patient eventually underwent transplantation. The mechanical hemodynamic support of the circulation by ventricular assist devices was effective in supporting these 2 patients who had sustained ventricular arrhythmias.

Abstract: Torsade de Pointes (Tdp) is a form of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia in the setting of prolonged QT interval. Any drug that prolongs repolarisation, and hence QT interval, may cause Tdp. Predisposing factors of drug-induced Tdp include female sex, bradyarrhythmia and hypokalaemia.
We retrospectively analysed the case notes of 13 patients with drug-induced LQTS from 1991 to 2000 from National Heart Centre and Changi General Hospital.
Causative drugs in the series were amiodarone (seven patients, 54%), sotalol (two patients), quinidine (one patient), phenothiazine (two patients) and astemizole (one patient). There were eight females and all were Chinese. The mean age was 72 +/- nine years. The patients commonly present with syncope (38%) and cardiac arrest (38%). The mean corrected QTC interval was 545 ms. The most common precipitating factor was hypokalaemia (31%). Nine patients require cardiopulmonary resuscitation and two patients (15%) died. Nine patients (69%) had underlying structural heart disease such as ischaemic heart disease, valvular heart disease and hypertensive heart disease. The left ventricular ejection fraction was normal in six patients. The onset of Tdp ranged from Day 2 to Day 5 in the seven patient with amiodarone-induced LQTS. These were inpatients who were given intravenous loading doses of amiodarone. Both patients with sotalol-induced LQTS were females on sotalol 80 mg and 240 mg per day with Tdp occurring on Day 2 and 10 months respectively.
Tdp is a potentially life-threatening arrhythmia. The list of torsadogenic drugs is ever expanding. Physicians need to know the drugs which can lead to Tdp. Careful assessment of risk-benefit ratio is important before prescribing such drugs. Amiodarone-induced Tdp is not uncommon in our local population. Initiation of a class III agent, especially amiodarone, should be done judiciously, with monitoring of the QT interval and avoidance of hypokalaemia.

Abstract: We report the case of a 45-year-old woman who had ingested 2000 mg of flecainide with suicidal intent. She developed therapy-resistant ventricular fibrillation (VF) with cardiopulmonary arrest. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation and advanced life support were sustained for 64 min. Following intravenous amiodarone, the patient developed an effective spontaneous rhythm and resumed breathing. An amiodarone infusion was started and continued over a period of 72 h. She recovered completely after 5 days, leaving the hospital without neurological sequelae. Serum flecainide levels approximately 5 h post-ingestion were 850 mg/l. This case report confirms the value of amiodarone in drug-resistant VF, even when the cause may be another antiarrhythmic drug such as flecainide.

Abstract: Amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) may develop either in apparently normal thyroid glands (Type II AIT) or in the presence of sub-clinical thyroid abnormalities (either autonomous goiter or latent Graves' disease; Type I AIT). Mixed forms also occur. While Type I AIT is due to iodine-induced excess thyroid hormone synthesis, Type II AIT is a form of amiodarone (possibly iodine) -induced destructive thyroiditis. Type I AIT is usually treated by combined thionamide and potassium perchlorate therapy, but may be resistant to therapy. On the other hand, Type II AIT often responds favorably to glucocorticoids and may not require further therapy once euthyroidism has been restored. Not infrequently, however, AIT (especially Type I) is resistant to conventional treatment, and several weeks or months may elapse before euthyroidism is restored. Thyroidectomy has been carried out in Type I AIT patients, but thyroid surgery in thyrotoxic patients, especially those with underlying cardiac problems, carries a high surgical risk. In this study we describe 3 patients with Type I AIT, who were successfully treated with a short course of iopanoic acid (IOP), an oral cholecystographic agent, which is rich in iodine and is a potent inhibitor of 5'-deiodinase, resulting in a marked decrease in the peripheral tissue conversion of T4 to T3, in preparation for thyroid surgery. Euthyroidism was rapidly restored in 7-12 days, allowing a subsequent safe and uneventful thyroidectomy in all cases. These patients were then treated with L-T4 for their hypothyroidism and amiodarone was safely re-instituted. We suggest that IOP is the drug of choice in the rapid restoration of euthyroidism prior to definitive thyroidectomy in patients with drug resistant Type I AIT.

Abstract: Careful thought must be given to the development of bystander pathology that could mimic worsening of heart failure. Recent trials with patients receiving amiodarone record a low rate of amiodarone pulmonary toxicity of 1.6%. Bronchoalveolar lavage in amiodarone toxicity demonstrates an absolute and relative lymphocytic alveolitis, suggesting hypersensitivity, but this finding is neither sensitive nor specific. Recently, KL-6, a mucin-like high molecular weight glycoprotein secreted by proliferating type II alveolar pneumocytes, has been identified as a potential marker of interstitial pneumonitis. A high index of suspicion combined with rapid exclusion of common confounding mimics can help in establishing the diagnosis of amiodarone lung toxicity.

Abstract: We report a case of a child with familial long QT syndrome (Jervell Lange-Nielsen) who had multiple electrical storms in the presence of b blocker and implantable cardioverter device (ICD) therapy. Discontinuation of ICD therapy and addition of oral amiodarone to b blockade therapy resulted in freedom from electrical storms.

Abstract: Atrial aneurysms involving the free wall or atrial appendage are rare entities in cardiology practice and may be associated with atrial arrhythmias or embolic phenomena. We review the literature and report a case of aneurysm of the right atrial appendage in a young adult, whose diagnosis was established with echocardiography after an episode of paroxysmal atrial flutter.

Abstract: Two cases of toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) are presented. A 27-year-old woman presented with peripherally located targetoid plaques, papules, blisters and lip erosions which began 9 days after 'recreational' use of 'speed' (dexamphetamine and ephedrine) consistent with erythema multiforme major. Three days later she developed widespread lesions with large areas of blistering affecting 40% of body surface area. The diagnosis was revised to TEN. Intravenous cyclosporin led to rapid prevention of new blister formation. A 71-year-old woman, 3 months after commencing amiodarone, developed extensive erythema, blistering and erosions affecting 50% of body surface area, with a maculopapular rash affecting the limbs and extremities consistent with a diagnosis of TEN. She developed septicaemia following bilateral pneumonia with pleural effusions and died 7 days after admission.

Abstract: The case of a 65 year old man with ischemic cardiomyopathy, an ICD device and recurrent electrical storms is presented. The patient had been implanted with an ICD device due to aborted sudden death. The first electrical storm occurred 12 months later. It was terminated by the administration of intravenous amiodarone and the patient was discharged on maintenance dose amiodarone and b-blocker. After a period of 3 months during which the patient remained asymptomatic, a second arrhythmic clustering occurred and it was controlled by the addition of mexiletine. A total number of 429 appropriate shocks had been delivered by the device. Thereafter and for a seven month follow-up period, the patient remains asymptomatic under this combination of antiarrhythmic drugs.

Abstract: Amiodarone is a heavily iodinated drug effective in the control of various tachyarrhythmias. Despite its undoubted benefit, treatment with amiodarone is not without risk, because a number of potentially serious side-effects may develop during therapy. Thyrotoxicosis is most commonly recognised but its potential consequences tend to be underestimated, and its treatment can be challenging and difficult. We report several cases of amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis which serve to highlight the potential severity of the condition.

Abstract: For a patient with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, an implantable defibrillator, and amiodarone induced thyrotoxicosis associated with ventricular fibrillation storm. Medical therapy was ineffective. Thyroidectomy resulted in immediate control of the arrhythmia and permitted reinitiation of amiodarone. At 18-month follow-up, the patient remained euthyroid on amiodarone and ventricular arrhythmia free.

Abstract: Amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity is usually seen in cardiac surgical patients who have received large doses of amiodarone for ventricular arrhythmias over prolonged periods. In this report, we describe a case of amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity after a short course of therapy for postoperative atrial fibrillation.

Abstract: Administration of oral azithromycin, in addition to previously well-tolerated long-term amiodarone therapy, was associated with a marked prolongation of QT interval and increased QT dispersion, both substrates for life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmia and torsades de pointes. This is a report of QT prolongation and increased QT dispersion associated with the use of azithromycin. The report assumes an added significance, in view of widespread empirical use of this antibiotic for the treatment of lower respiratory infections and belief of its safety in patients with cardiac diseases. Based on the authors' experience, they would like to emphasize that the combination of azithromycin with other drugs known to prolong QT or causing torsades de pointes be used with caution until the question of the proarrhythmic effect of azithromycin is resolved by further studies.

Abstract: Amiodarone is a highly effective antiarrhythmic agent for the prevention of life-threatening arrhythmias. Two cases are described of patients who developed bronchial asthma after treatment with amiodarone. The bronchial asthma resolved after the dose of amiodarone was decreased in both patients. To our knowledge, an association between amiodarone and severe bronchial asthma has previously been reported only once in the medical literature. Physicians should note that amiodarone may cause bronchospasm in susceptible patients.

Abstract: A 27-week baby with antenatally diagnosed supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) and hydrops fetalis was delivered by emergency caesarean section because of severe fetal bradycardia. The mother was on flecanide to control the fetal SVT. The baby was hydropic at birth and required prolonged ventilatory support. On day 6, he developed acute renal failure for which peritoneal dialysis was done. On day 23, he developed several episodes of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) which did not respond to intravenous adenosine and amiodarone and ultimately required intravenous flecanide. This case report highlights the management of a critically ill premature hydropic baby with resistant SVT, and the successful outcome.

Abstract: Amiodarone is an antiarrhythmic drug that can cause interstitial pneumonitis leading to pulmonary fibrosis. A 62-year-old man suffering from atrial fibrillation and recurrent dyspnea was treated with amiodarone. After 15 months of treatment, HRCT revealed bilateral interstitial and alveolar opacifications with high-attenuating pleural-parenchymal consolidations, suggesting amiodarone induced pneumonitis. Three months after cessation of amiodarone treatment, HRCT shows complete regression of pneumonitis. Amiodarone pneumonitis can be misinterpreted and mistreated in patients with further underlying diseases. The present case report demonstrates the diagnostic value of HRCT in the diagnosis of interstitial pneumonitis.

Abstract: The patient was a 46-year-old man with a history of syncope attack after diarrhea. Nonsustained polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (PVT) initiated by short-coupled premature ventricular complex was detected by Holter monitoring. No organic heart disease was found, and the QT interval during sinus rhythm was normal. It was thought that the PVT might be related to hypokalemia, so electrophysiological studies were performed under the condition of hypokalemia (K=3.4mmol/L), after potassium loading (K=4.2mmol/L) and after oral amiodarone therapy. Under the condition of hypokalemia, nonsustained PVT occurred spontaneously, and the monophasic action potential duration at 90% repolarization (MAPD90) at the right ventricular apex was very short (175 ms). The MAPD90 returned to normal after loading potassium (230ms) and after oral amiodarone therapy (240ms), and PVT no longer occurred. With continued oral amiodarone and spironolactone therapy, the patient has been free of syncope attack over a follow-up period of 5 years.

Abstract: Antineoplastic therapy can be associated with drug-induced lung toxicity. With the increasing use of amiodarone for cardiac dysrhythmias there is an increasing possibility of its combined use with chemotherapies for various malignancies. We report a patient on long-term amiodarone who developed biopsy-proven drug-induced lung toxicity after receiving high-dose cyclophosphamide, at a time-frame much shorter than would have been predicted with cyclophosphamide alone. The potential for enhanced lung toxicity secondary to combination of amiodarone and cyclophosphamide is discussed.

Abstract: A 12-year-old male child presented with recurrent syncope. Ventricular tachycardia was noted on the electrocardiogram. Transthoracic echocardiogram revealed a homogeneous tumor mass in the right ventricular cavity with extension into the outflow region. Left cervical lymph node biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The tumor resolved completely with chemotherapy without surgical intervention.

Abstract: Concomitant occurrence of pulmonary embolism and right ventricular infarction is rare. It poses important diagnostic and therapeutic implications. A case of pulmonary embolism with isolated right ventricular anterior wall infarction presented with ventricular tachycardia. One pathology could have led to the other. Two-dimensional echocardiography was useful in documenting pulmonary artery hypertension as well as regional wall motion abnormality of the right ventricle. Thrombolytic therapy and dobutamine infusion were useful. Nitrates, fluid infusion and diuretics should be used cautiously.

Abstract: We describe a 51-yr-old man presenting with syncope due to torsade de pointes. The torsade de pointes was refractory to conventional medical therapy, including infusion of isoproterenol, MgSO4, potassium, lidocaine, and amiodarone. His past history, physical findings, and hormone study confirmed that QT prolongation was caused by anterior hypopituitarism that developed as a sequela of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome. The long QT interval with deep inverted T wave was completely normalized 4 weeks after starting steroid and thyroid hormone replacement. Hormonal disorders should be considered as a cause of torsade de pointes, because this life-threatening arrhythmia can be treated by replacing the missing hormone.

Abstract: We report cases of serious arrhythmias associated with apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (AHCM). Thirty-one patients were referred to our institute to undergo further assessment of their AHCM from 1988 to 1999. Three patients with nonsustained ventricular tachycardia demonstrated an 123I-MIBG regional reduction in the tracer uptake. In two patients with ventricular fibrillation (VF), the findings from 123I-MIBG imaging revealed regional sympathetic denervation in the inferior and lateral regions. Electrophysiologic study demonstrated reproducible induction of VF in aborted sudden death and presyncopal patients, resulting in the need for an implantable defibrillator device and amiodarone in each patient. Patients with refractory atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response suffered from serious congestive heart failure. A prudent assessment and strategy in patients with this disease would be indispensable in avoiding a disastrous outcome.

Abstract: An implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) was used in a 62-year-old man with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) because of hemodynamically intolerable ventricular tachycardia (VT). Amiodarone was administered after a second episode of ICD discharge. Three weeks later, incessant VT appeared, and DC discharge failed to terminate it. Microvolt T wave alternans (TWA), measured by a spectral method, was observed in this patient with and without amiodarone administration. The onset heart rate with TWA was lower and the alternans voltage was higher with amiodarone than without it. The effects of amiodarone appeared to be related to the exacerbation of VT and an increased defibrillation threshold. TWA might be useful in predicting the proarrhythmic effects of amiodarone in similar cases.

Abstract: Junctional ectopic tachycardia (JET) occurs most frequently after operative repair of congenital heart defects. The mechanism is thought to involve direct trauma to the atrioventricular node and His bundle resulting in an ectopic focus. Several therapeutic methods have been described in the pediatric literature with varying degrees of success and complication rates. Because heart rates may exceed 200 to 300 beats per minute, there may be inadequate time for ventricular filling. Ventricular filling can be further compromised because of the asynchrony between the atria and the ventricles. These factors can lead to significant compromise of cardiovascular function in the postoperative patient. We describe our experience with amiodarone in two patients who developed postoperative JET after repair of congenital heart defects. Dosing regimens and previous experience with amiodarone in patients with JET are reviewed.

Abstract: Amiodarone has a high incidence of side effects, but few pro-arrhythmic effects. We report a case of amiodarone-induced torsade de pointes in a child aged 10 years. The patient had severe dilated cardiomyopathy, and even though he was treated with low oral doses of amiodarone, without dosage increments and electrolyte imbalance, he developed torsade de pointes at nights, after T-wave modification and increases of the corrected QT interval (QTc, 20%), QT dispersion (QTd, 175%) and QTcd (116%). The arrhythmic events were preceded by sinus bradycardia at Holter monitoring. Amiodarone therapy was discontinued. Intravenous magnesium administration was not effective in the suppression of torsade de pointes. High-rate atrial pacing prevented recurrences of the arrhythmias and reduced the QTc interval by 20%, QTd by 50%, and QTcd by 70%; QTd and QTcd returned below normal limits. This case underscores the need of careful electrocardiographic monitoring during amiodarone therapy.

Abstract: A patient with mechanical heart valves developed bleeding, after the introduction of amiodarone and azithromycin. Though the anticoagulant effect could be neutralized, the patient succumbed to heart failure. Any new drug prescribed to patients on anticoagulant must be assessed for its potential for interaction and warrants frequent prothrombin time testing.

Abstract: A 70-year-old woman with dilated cardiomyopathy and ventricular tachyarrhythmia was initially treated in 1990 with intravenous amiodarone (240 mg). She developed a junctional escape rhythm (48 beats/min) with QT prolongation (QT: 0.68 s) and 8 h later developed torsade de pointes (TdP). Because other antiarrhythmic drugs did not suppress the arrhythmia, oral amiodarone (100 mg/day) was started in 1995, 7 weeks before she presented with congestive heart failure. The QT prolongation (QTc: 0.64) increased after administration of dopamine, and TdP again developed. This case suggests that amiodarone induces proarrhythmias by different mechanisms when administered intravenously or orally.

Abstract: Amiodarone is a useful drug for the treatment of life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias. However, amiodarone can induced pulmonary toxicity (APT) and may cause life-threatening lung damage. APT can be difficult to diagnose, but early diagnosis is important. Here, in a 51-year-old man with APT, the high serum KL-6 level was correlated with the severity of symptoms and chest X-ray findings, and it was inversely correlated with PaO2 and diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide levels. The findings suggest that the serum KL-6 level may be increased in APT and that therefore it's the determination of serum KL-6 may provide a useful indicator and/or monitoring marker of APT. KL-6 is believed to be produced and secreted by type II pneumocytes. Typical pathological findings of APT include proliferation of type II pneumocytes which may produce KL-6, and result in increased serum KL-6 levels.

Abstract: A nonfluoroscopic electroanatomical cardiac mapping system (CARTO) integrates anatomical and electrophysiological information to reconstruct a three-dimensional activation map. Information from the CARTO system helps to reveal the mechanism and perform successful ablation in scar re-entry ventricular tachycardia after cardiac surgery. Three-dimensional activation and propagation mapping was performed in a patient with ventricular tachycardia after surgical correction of a double outlet right ventricle. The ventricular tachycardia appeared in two morphologies and were refractory to antiarrhythmic medication including amiodarone. Both ventricular tachycardias were re-entered using the ventriculotomy scar but rotated in different directions. Successful radiofrequency ablation was performed by creating a line of conduction block from the pulmonic valve to the ventriculotomy scar using entrainment mapping and the ablation lesion tagging technique. The CARTO system is useful in mapping and guiding the ablation of complex ventricular tachycardia after surgical correction in congenital heart disease

Abstract: The congenital form of junctional ectopic tachycardia has never been reported during the prenatal period. We describe a case in which the diagnosis could be ascertained in utero with the superior vena cava/ascending aorta Doppler approach. The diagnosis was based on the evidence of ventricular tachycardia with atrioventricular (AV) dissociation and the simultaneous occurrence of atrial and ventricular contractions during an episode of tachycardia with 1:1 AV relationship.

Abstract: Right ventricular dysplasia (RVD) is a disease entity of unknown cause that is characterised by partial or total replacement of RV-muscle by adipose or fibrous tissue. It is a well-recognized cause of arrhythmia and premature sudden death, but usually underdiagnosed. Several noninvasive and invasive diagnostic modalities have been used, however, all may not be positive in a given case. Drug therapy with class 1c, beta-blocker, and amiodarone in variable combination produce varying success rates in preventing recurrent ventricular tachycardia. Failure of the above measures calls for insertion of implantable cardioverter defibrillator. The attention of emergency physicians is drown to this disease as they are the first medical personnel to be presented with this disease as an emergency. Hence their recognition of RVD will ensure early and proper management.

Abstract: A 57-year-old man with primary dilated cardiomyopathy and obesity received an implantable cardioverter defibrillator because of recurrent, poorly tolerated ventricular tachycardia despite continuous treatment with amiodarone. When the device was implanted, assessment of the ability to defibrillate induced ventricular fibrillation showed high energy requirements, with a lack of conventional safety margin between energies effective at defibrillation testing and maximal device output. Treatment with oral amiodarone was withdrawn and substituted with oral sotalol. A repeat defibrillation test, performed 54 days after amiodarone withdrawal and during D,L -sotalol treatment, showed a reduction in defibrillation energy requirements. In view of this experience, replacement of amiodarone treatment with an alternate class III agent (D,L -sotalol or other agents, if available) can be considered as a possible option in case of high defibrillation threshold at the time of the implantation in a patient receiving continuous amiodarone treatment.

Abstract: Amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) is not an uncommon complication in countries with low iodine intake. Two types of AIT have been described. Type 1 is associated with an underlying disorder of the gland that becomes clinically evident because of the high intrathyroidal iodine content, which acts as a trigger for hyperthyroidism. Type 2 is characterized by an ongoing inflammatory process of the thyroid, with derangement of the parenchyma causing the release of thyroid hormones into the circulation. Yet, there are no definitive tools for the differential diagnosis of these two entities, and the therapeutic approach is still a subject of controversy. A case of AIT type 2 successfully treated with steroids is described followed by a review of the literature.

Abstract: Hepatotoxicity due to chronic amiodarone (AD) use is well described. However, hepatitis occurring after acute administration of AD has only occasionally been reported and the pathologic findings in the liver in this condition have not been well characterized. We describe an idiosyncratic reaction, in a 40-year-old man after 6 weeks of oral AD therapy, consisting of acute hepatitis, which resolved after withdrawal of the drug. The liver biopsy showed clusters of cells with granular cytoplasm. These cells were characterized as macrophages, and phospholipid membranous inclusions were demonstrated ultrastructurally in the granular cells and in the hepatocytes. Pathologists and clinicians should be aware of this subtle histologic finding when looking for evidence to support AD hepatotoxicity.

Abstract: To evaluate a case of atypical optic neuropathy that presented with blurred vision following the use of an antiarrythmic agent.
Record of the patient was reviewed to determine the etiology of his optic neuropathy.
Ophthalmological examination revealed unilateral optic disc edema with relatively well-preserved visual acuity. In routine tests, results of complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, liver and kidney function tests, chest x-ray, Goldmann visual field examination, and brain computed tomography scan were normal. Orbital ultrasonography revealed optic disc edema with prominent optic nerve head and without orbital pathology.
Systemic history and drug intake should be investigated in every patient with optic disc edema. Discontinuation of the medication can prevent further optic nerve damage or involvement of the other eye.

Abstract: Amiodarone is an effective cardiac antiarytmic drug. Long-term, high dose use of the drug is associated with skin discolouration, corneal deposition and alterations in thyroid hormone levels. We present the case of a 61-year-old woman suffering from the combination of these three side-effects.

Abstract: We report a case of acute interstitial nephritis and fatal Stevens-Johnson syndrome in a 90-year-old woman with amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism, who had been treated for 5 weeks with propylthiouracil (PTU). On admission, the patient exhibited acute renal failure and generalized macular purpuric eruption. Acute interstitial nephritis and Stevens-Johnson syndrome were diagnosed and PTU withdrawn. Although renal function recovered after PTU withdrawal and corticosteroid therapy, the patient's condition worsened, and she died after developing multiple organ failure. Acute interstitial nephritis seems to be rarely associated with PTU therapy. Moreover, a literature review suggested that this could represent the first published report of a Stevens-Johnson syndrome developing during PTU therapy.

Abstract: This is the first report of Cushing's syndrome under oral budesonide treatment. An 81-year-old man known for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and chronic renal insufficiency, treated with 6 mg budesonide for collagenous colitis, developed Cushing's syndrome under co-administration of amiodarone. The Cushing's syndrome disappeared after discontinuation of the amiodarone treatment. Metabolism of the two medications by hepatic cytochrome P 450 3A may explain the development of Cushing's syndrome.

Abstract: A 48-year-old man presented with bilateral blurred vision and visual field changes while prescribed amiodarone. Improvement of vision and visual field defects was documented within 3 weeks after discontinuation of the medication, and complete resolution occurred at 3 months. A unique feature of this amiodarone-associated optic neuropathy is the absence of any optic nerve edema.

Abstract: With the increasing trend of cross mixing of populations, aconitine induced poisoning and its related arrhythmias may be more frequently encountered worldwide. However, the clinical experience is often too limited to draw any conclusion on the optimal treatment for tachycardia induced by aconitine intoxication. The clinical presentation, serial electrocardiographic changes, and responses to antiarrhythmic agents are reported in a patient with aconitine induced life threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmia. Amiodarone was effective in suppressing polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, which might provide an example of successful pharmacological intervention in aconitine induced ventricular tachyarrhythmia.

Abstract: This is the report of a case of fetal tachyarrhythmia with 1:1 atrioventricular conduction detected by pre-natal echocardiography in a fetus at 25-weeks gestation. Adenosine infusion via cordocentesis was performed as a diagnostic test to differentiate between atrioventricular nodal reentrant supraventricular tachyarrhythmia and atrial flutter. After infusion, transient 2:1 atrioventricular dissociation was obtained and the diagnosis of atrial flutter was made. Transplacental therapy with digoxin and amiodarone was then successfully used.

Abstract: Propafenone is an effective antiarrhythmic drug used widely for the treatment of supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias. Although it is generally well tolerated, 30 to 45% of patients may experience adverse cardiac effects. In 15 to 20% of patients, adverse effects may involve other organ systems. A wide variety of adverse central nervous system effects have been reported in association with propafenone; dizziness is the most common. Ataxia caused by propafenone has been reported to the pharmaceutical companies and drug monitoring agencies, but has not been well described or emphasized in the medical literature. We describe 3 elderly patients with moderate to severe ataxia that occurred while they were taking propafenone.

Abstract: Amiodarone, an iodine-rich benzofuran derivative, is a highly effective agent for the prophylaxis and treatment of cardiac arrhythmias, but it is associated with numerous side effects. Amiodarone toxicity involving several organs simultaneously has rarely been reported heretofore. In this report, we describe a case of a 73-year-old man who developed symptomatic hypothyroidism, pulmonary toxicity, and vortex epitheliopathy of the cornea during 6 months of amiodarone therapy for frequent palpitation and angina after myocardial infarction. This case illustrates that amiodarone may cause toxicity involving several organs concurrently in a patient receiving long-term amiodarone therapy. This may be of clinical significance in managing such patients.

Abstract: Amiodarone is a class III antiarrhythmic agent that is effective in treating different types of cardiac dysrhythmias. It was approved only for treatment of life-threatening ventricular dysrhythmias refractory to other therapy; however, its use for atrial dysrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation is well accepted. Adverse effects associated with amiodarone include pulmonary, hepatic, thyroid, ocular, and neurologic toxicities. Our patient experienced intermittent fever, night sweats, and fatigue while taking the drug for treatment of atrial fibrillation. Bone marrow biopsy showed granuloma formation after 17 months of therapy with amiodarone. Amiodarone was discontinued due to significant hypotension and shortness of breath. To our knowledge, this is the third case report of granuloma formation in bone marrow possibly associated with this agent.

Abstract: Resuscitation from cardiac arrest caused by volatile substance abuse is rarely successful. Large doses of catecholamines given during resuscitation, in the presence of butane, may cause recurrent ventricular fibrillation. We report a case of prolonged resuscitation in a young man who had inhaled butane. Cardiac output was restored 10 min after the administration of intravenous amiodarone. We suggest that antiarrhythmic agents should be used early during resuscitation to prevent recurrent arrhythmias.

Abstract: Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia is an inherited, progressive condition. Characterised by fatty infiltration of the right ventricle, it frequently results in life threatening cardiac arrhythmias, and is one of the important causes of sudden cardiac death in the young. There are characteristic electrocardiographic and echocardiographic features that all physicians need to be aware of if we are to reduce these occurrences of premature death. Diagnosis with magnetic resonance imaging is discussed along with current treatment options.

Abstract: A recently described focal origin of atrial fibrillation, mainly inside pulmonary veins, is creating new perspectives for radiofrequency catheter ablation. However, pulmonary venous stenosis may occur with uncertain clinical consequences. This report describes a veno-occlusive syndrome secondary to left pulmonary vein stenosis after radiofrequency catheter ablation.
A 36-year-old man who experienced daily episodes of atrial fibrillation that was refractory to antiarrhythmic medication, including amiodarone, was enrolled in our focal atrial fibrillation radiofrequency catheter ablation protocol. The left superior pulmonary vein was the earliest site mapped, and radiofrequency ablation was performed. Atrial fibrillation was interrupted and sinus rhythm restored after one radiofrequency pulse inside the left superior pulmonary vein. Atrial fibrillation recurred and a new procedure was performed in an attempt to isolate (26 radiofrequency pulses around the ostium) the left superior pulmonary vein. Ten days later, the patient developed chest pain and hemoptysis related to severe left superior and inferior pulmonary veins stenosis. Balloon angioplasty of both veins was followed by complete relief of symptoms after 2 months of recurrent pulmonary symptoms. The patient has been asymptomatic for 12 months, without antiarrhythmic drugs.
Multiple radiofrequency pulses applied inside the pulmonary veins ostia can induce severe pulmonary venous stenosis and veno-occlusive pulmonary syndrome.

Abstract: Fetal cardiac arrhythmias are one of the causes of intra-uterine congestive heart failure and non-immune hydrops fetalis leading to fetal death. As ventricular tachycardia (VT) is rarely diagnosed in utero, it leads to emergency deliveries. We report a prenatal diagnosis of fetal tachycardia at 20 weeks of gestation associated with non-immune hydrops fetalis. The tachycardia seemed to be supraventricular and was initially treated by digoxin and sotalol. The hydrops increased and sotalol was stopped in order to give the mother a high dose of amiodarone by mouth over a long period. Although the tachycardia, which the ECG recorded at birth revealed to be of ventricular origin, persisted but at a lower rate, the new treatment proved successful. The child is three years old now and health, though with persistent VT. In conclusion, fetal tachycardia with similar ventricular and atrial rates can be a VT and the drug of choice in this case seems to be amiodarone.

Abstract: Amiodarone is an iodinated benzofuran derivative class III antiarrhythmic that is highly effective in suppressing ventricular and supraventricular arrhythmias. It is also associated with an imposing side effect profile, which often limits its use. Numerous adverse effects have been documented including skin discolouration, photosensitivity, hepatitis, thyroid dysfunction, corneal deposits, pulmonary fibrosis, bone marrow suppression and drug interactions. These side effects are thought to be correlated with the total cumulative dose of amiodarone, but idiopathic reactions have been reported. The majority of adverse reactions resolve with discontinuation of the drug; however, rapid progression may occur, which may be fatal. The present report documents a patient who had a combination of serious amiodarone toxicities that, once recognized, were treated and eventually resulted in a good outcome.

Abstract: Tasmania is an area of endemic iodine deficiency. Amiodarone is a class III anti-arrhythmic drug that is widely used for the management of ventricular and supraventricular tachydysrhythmias. Individuals from areas of endemic iodine deficiency appear more likely to manifest hyperthyroidism following amiodarone therapy, whereas hypothyroidism is a more frequent complication in iodine-replete communities.
Cases series. The clinical and biochemical response to medical and surgical management of five consecutive Tasmanian patients presenting with severe type-II amiodarone-associated thyrotoxicosis was reviewed.
Five patients were identified. Combinations of antithyroid therapy including propylthiouracil, lithium carbonate, dexamethasone and cholestyramine were used. Thyroidectomy was required in two cases (40%) due to severe unremitting thyrotoxicosis despite combined drug regimens. Anaesthesia and total thyroidectomy were undertaken without complication despite the presence of severe hyperthyroidism at the time of surgery. In both cases thyroid histopathology demonstrated degenerative and destructive follicular lesions with multinuclear cell infiltrate and focal fibrosis.
Amiodarone-associated thyrotoxicosis may be severe and refractory to medical therapy. Despite the potential risks of anaesthesia associated with uncontrolled thyrotoxicosis, thyroidectomy should be considered in the setting of life-threatening thyrotoxicosis.

Abstract: A patient with Brugada syndrome experienced incessant ventricular fibrillation 7 years after implantation of an ICD. General anesthesia, fast ventricular pacing, bretylium, and atenolol infusion were ineffective; amiodarone infusion was started. After 190 defibrillation shocks over 36 hours, the electrical storm stopped. A multiorgan failure occurred as a complication of the electrical storm and necessitated prolonged reanimation. Thorough cardiac evaluation revealed no structural abnormality and the patient, now on chronic oral amiodarone therapy, remains free of arrhythmia 1 year after the event.

Abstract: Recurrent ventricular fibrillation was observed in a 29-year-old Vietnamese man who did not exhibit structural heart disease. The patient's ECG showed prominent J (Osborn) waves and ST segment elevation in the inferior leads that were not associated with hypothermia, serum electrolyte disturbance, or myocardial ischemia. Rate-dependent change in the amplitude of J waves and ST segment elevation also were observed. An implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) was implanted. Adjunctive treatment with amiodarone reduced J wave amplitude, preventing ventricular fibrillation and ICD shocks. Prominent J waves and ST segment elevation in the inferior leads may serve as an important diagnostic sign to detect high-risk individuals with a history of unexplained syncope. ICD implantation plus amiodarone is the treatment of choice.

Abstract: There are many visually threatening conditions that may result from long-term use of systemic medications. Many of these adverse side effects can be greatly reduced or prevented with close monitoring of patients. In view of current knowledge, updated clinical guidelines for appropriate monitoring of ocular toxicity from systemic medications need to be developed for the eye care practitioner.
There have been many reports of ocular toxicity from isoniazid, thioridazine, steroids, and amiodarone therapy. Clinical cases illustrating possible adverse ocular side effects are presented, which include INH-induced optic neuropathy, phenothiazine-induced retinopathy, steroid-induced glaucoma, and vortex epitheliopathy secondary to amiodarone.
Optometrists should be aware of the potential for ocular side effects from systemic medications. Eye care guidelines for monitoring ocular side effects from thioridazine, INH, steroids, and amiodarone use are suggested.

Abstract: Single dose intravenous amiodarone has been widely used and shown to be effective to treat supraventricular and ventricular arrhythemias in cardiac surgery. We, herein, report a 60-year-old female patient, sustaining cardiogenic shock in the course of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) for unstable angina unrelieved by medication including nitroglycerin, succumbed to a life-saving emergent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) operation at the end of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) following a 180 mg bolus dose of amiodarone (3 mg/kg) directed at the ventricular arrhythmias, triggered by protamine and unresponsive to lidocaine treatment. Amiodaroneinduced asystole and vasoplegia were thought to be the causation of the failure of resuscitation. The causes of the development of these complications, the potential hazards of its use and the management relative to the consequential complications are reviewed and discussed.

Abstract: Amiodarone is a class III antiarrhythmic drug used in dogs with dilated cardiomyopathy and ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Hepatopathy is one of the more commonly reported adverse effects of amiodarone use in people. We describe 4 dogs that developed hepatopathy associated with amiodarone administration; 2 dogs also developed neutropenia. Three dogs had clinical signs of anorexia and lethargy; 1 did not show signs until impaired liver function had developed. Clinical signs or biochemical abnormalities developed 1.5-8 months after amiodarone treatment was started. Clinical signs resolved within 2 weeks of discontinuing amiodarone, but biochemical abnormalities did not resolve for 6-8 weeks. The delay between onset of liver disease and overt clinical signs suggests that serial evaluation of liver enzyme activities following amiodarone use in does is important.

Abstract: A 33 year-old woman was referred to our hospital for further treatment of ventricular tachycardia (VT). During treatment with amiodarone (200 mg/day), clinical VT at the cycle length of 510 ms was induced. During the VT, rapid ventricular pacing was repeated at progressively shorter cycle lengths after a decrement of 10 ms steps. The VT was entrained by the rapid pacing and reproducibly terminated at a paced cycle length of 380 ms. Four weeks after reducing the amiodarone to 100 mg/day, programmed stimulation was repeated. The VT with the same morphology but with a slightly shorter cycle length of 480 ms was again induced. However, at this time, rapid pacing from the same site could not terminate VT and transient acceleration developed at a shorter paced cycle length of 260 ms. The QT (QTc) interval, effective refractory period at the pacing site and width of the paced QRS complex were similar before and after changing the amiodarone treatment. The most characteristic change of VT in the second study was a widening of the entrainment zone, which was calculated as the difference between VT cycle length and the longest pacing cycle length which interrupts VT during the entrainment (from 130 to > 220 ms), and it may be explained by the preferential shortening of the action potential duration and/or facilitation of the depressed cell to cell conduction within the reentry circuit. Amiodarone must exert a preferential action in the reentry circuit and modulate the conduction property as well as the effective refractory period. We should pay close attention to the efficacy of antitachycardia pacing during the modification of amiodarone treatment.

Abstract: Amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity (AIPT) is one of the most serious adverse effects of amiodarone therapy and can be fatal. Therefore, vigilant monitoring is advised. Baseline chest radiograph and pulmonary function tests and follow-up chest films at 3-month intervals are advocated. However, since abnormalities on these two examinations do not always precede symptoms, patient self-reports of respiratory symptoms appear to be the best method for early detection of AIPT.

Abstract: We describe an elderly woman who presented with significant hyponatremia caused by the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) during therapy with amiodarone. The hyponatremia resolved after discontinuation of the drug and did not recur during a follow-up period of 6 months. Such an association has previously been reported only once in the medical literature. Since severe hyponatremia can produce significant neurologic damage and is associated with a high mortality rate, clinicians should be aware that this complication may occur during amiodarone therapy.

Abstract: Pentavalent antimonial drugs used for the treatment of leishmaniasis have been associated with sudden deaths, probably due to the development of ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Prolongation of the QT interval and ventricular tachyarrhymias have been described in patients on amiodarone therapy. We report a case of recurrent torsades de pointes following treatment with pentavalent antimonial drugs and amiodarone.

Abstract: Sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) developed in a 58-year-old man with acute myocardial infarction and end-stage renal disease. Amiodarone was effective in preventing VT recurrence. Sustained VT was not induced during an electrophysiologic study. However, VT recurred during accidental hyperkalemia, which was caused by the change of dialysis therapy from peritoneal dialysis to hemodialysis. VT subsided with correction of hyperkalemia. Thereafter, VT did not recur as long as the serum potassium concentration was kept within the normal range. Several months later, the patient died suddenly because poor dietary compliance resulted in an increase in his potassium concentration. This case suggests that hyperkalemia may reverse the potent antiarrhythmic effects of amiodarone.

Abstract: We report the case of a fetus with supraventricular tachycardia complicated by congestive heart failure and ascites. After failure of initial transplacental treatment, the injection of amiodarone into the umbilical vein combined with evacuation of ascites achieved conversion to sinus rhythm and restored cardiac function thus allowing pregnancy to go to term. This report suggests that direct fetal therapy by umbilical vein puncture and evacuation of effusions constitutes an effective treatment for supraventricular tachycardias with massive fetal hydrops which do not respond to transplacental treatment.

Abstract: A preterm infant was born at 35 weeks gestation after failed antenatal antiarrhythmic therapy. The infant had an incessant supraventricular tachycardia, impaired ventricular function and hypotension and failed to respond to adenosine, cardioversion and intravenous amiodarone. After resuscitation from cardiovascular collapse, a successful radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFA) of a left free wall atrioventricular pathway was performed at 24 h of age without extracorporeal support. The infant is normal on follow up at 12 months of age. Whilst most fetal and neonatal supraventricular tachyarrhythmias respond to antiarrhythmic medications and RFA is not required, this is the earliest RFA to be performed on a premature infant when antiarrhythmics have failed.

Abstract: Ocular changes during treatment with amiodarone are almost universal but are rarely serious. In this article we describe three patients from a single electrophysiology practice in whom optic neuropathy developed during treatment with amiodarone. All three patients were more than 65 years of age. The doses of amiodarone ranged from 100 to 400 mg/day, and the time intervals between the initiation of the amiodarone therapy and the appearance of first symptoms of optic neuropathy were 5 to 19 months. Two patients had bilateral involvement, and one had only unilateral involvement. Whether this result was due solely to amiodarone therapy, to the underlying poor health of these patients, or to the combination of these two factors is uncertain. These findings prompt us to recommend that all patients who receive amiodarone undergo complete ophthalmologic examinations, including careful evaluation of the ocular fundus regularly during such therapy. No randomized study had been undertaken to determine the true incidence of complications associated with this medication.

Abstract: Junctional ectopic tachycardia (JET) is a rare cardiac arrhythmia characterized by atrio-ventricular dissociation, a high rate junctional escape rhythm and poor clinical tolerance in neonates and infants. Sudden infant death has been reported. The intra-uterine presentation of this arrhythmia is unknown. We report a familial form of JET with antenatal diagnosis. A sustained tachycardia at a rate of 170 beats/min with a 1:1 conduction was diagnosed in a hydropic fetus at a gestational age of 32 weeks. The older brother had presented with prenatal hydrops and junctional ectopic tachycardia was diagnosed at birth. Assuming that this arrhythmia was a JET, amiodarone was given to the mother in order to control the fetal tachycardia. The arrhythmia persisted with a 1/1 pattern but at a slower ventricular rate (140 beats/min). The ECG performed at birth revealed a narrow QRS tachycardia with a ventricular rate of 180 beats/min and a 1/1 retrograde conduction. Amiodarone therapy was continued with the addition of propanolol. Postnatal echocardiography revealed normal chambers and left ventricular dysfunction with a left ventricular shortening fraction of 17 per cent. Subsequent ECGs and Holter monitoring demonstrated typical electrocardiographic features of JET. Both parents had a normal ECG and Holter monitoring. A fetal tachycardia of moderately high rate with a 1/1 retrograde conduction and poor cardiac tolerance can be due to JET. In such cases, the use of amiodarone can be considered as a first line drug.

Abstract: We present a case of early (within the first 24 hours) development of malignant torsades de pointes (TdP) associated with intravenous amiodarone therapy. After correction of predisposing factors (heart failure, hypokalemia, digoxin) amiodarone again resulted in torsades. This observation suggests that in patients who have experienced amiodarone-induced proarrhythmia, amiodarone administration under different, more stable clinical conditions may still be hazardous.

Abstract: To describe a case of pseudotumor cerebri associated with the administration of intermediate-dose cytarabine.
An 11-year-old Hispanic boy with acute myeloblastic leukemia developed symptoms of pseudotumor cerebri (headache, diplopia, photophobia, nausea, vomiting) after receiving chemotherapy including cytarabine. The patient improved after a lumbar puncture and treatment with prednisone and acetazolamide, and is now asymptomatic.
Pseudotumor cerebri is a condition usually associated with obese women of child-bearing age. Case reports in pediatric patients are unusual. Several medications have been implicated in causing pseudotumor cerebri, including antimicrobials (tetracycline, naladixic acid), amiodarone, lithium carbonate, vitamin A and its derivatives, growth hormone, and corticosteroids. Chemotherapy agents reported to cause pseudotumor cerebri include busulfan with cyclophosphamide, and the combination of vinblastine, cisplatin, and bleomycin. Most of the information on medication-induced pseudotumor cerebri is in the form of case reports. Different mechanisms for causing this condition have been offered for individual medications. Most of these explanations involve fluid imbalance or interference with the Na+/K+ adenosine triphosphatase pump. Controlled studies are difficult because this condition is an unpredictable and rare occurrence. Cytarabine has frequently been associated with neurologic toxicities, but few reports of pseudotumor cerebri can be found.
The exact cause of pseudotumor cerebri in this patient is unknown, but cytarabine seems a likely cause. The mechanism by which cytarabine could cause this reaction is unclear.

Abstract: We report amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity in an 18-year-old boy who had undergone corrective surgery for tetralogy of Fallot 4 years earlier, and was treated with amiodarone because of recurrent malignant postoperative ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Toxicity was recognized on the basis of clinical features, chest X-ray, high-resolution contrast enhanced computerized tomography, and resolution of the findings subsequent to withdrawal of amiodarone and treatment with steroids. Pulmonary toxicity due to amiodarone, as far as we know, has not been reported in children and young adults, and its occurence even in young adults requires wider appreciation.

Abstract: We report the case of an electrical storm in a cardiac arrest survivor with an ICD, in whom chronic oral amiodarone failed to suppress ventricular arrhythmias, and in whom intravenous amiodarone resulted in stability for 6 weeks prior to successful cardiac transplantation. Intravenous amiodarone can be successful in suppressing life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, even when chronic oral amiodarone is unsuccessful.

Abstract: Cholestasis has been reported as a rare presentation among patients with severe liver injury secondary to amiodarone hepatic toxicity. We report an unusual case of amiodarone-induced cholestatic hepatotoxicity occurring after amiodarone had been discontinued and the initial abnormal liver function findings had improved. The patient, without jaundice at the initial presentation, developed severe jaundice about 4 months after withdrawal of amiodarone. Light and transmission electron microscopic examination of a specimen secured by computed tomographically guided liver biopsy was consistent with amiodarone hepatic toxicity as the cause of intrahepatic cholestasis. An abdominal ultrasound, endoscopic retrograde cholangiography, and dimethyl iminodiacetic acid and computed tomographic scans of the abdomen all failed to demonstrate any other causes for jaundice other than amiodarone toxicity. Thus, amiodarone hepatic toxicity may occur after drug withdrawal even if results of liver function tests improve. Histopathologic examination of a liver biopsy specimen is of value for diagnosis and prognosis. The liver biopsy findings, clinical course, and liver function test results are discussed, and the English-language literature on amiodarone cholestatic hepatotoxicity is reviewed.

Abstract: A patient who was treated with amiodarone for 3 years developed brown discoloration of the intraocular lenses in both eyes. Contrast sensitivity and blue perception were reduced in the right eye. After vitrectomy for a vitreoretinal traction syndrome in the left eye, the discoloration appeared to increase. The apparent progression may have been related to breakdown of the blood-aqueous barrier after vitrectomy. However, because the discoloration developed before surgery and was bilateral, long-term administration of amiodarone may also have played a role.

Abstract: A 33-year-old woman with congenital heart disease and atrial and ventricular arrhythmias, managed over the long term with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator, epicardial pacing system, and amiodarone, experienced an increase in palpitations and a shock from her defibrillator. Evaluation revealed decreases in amiodarone and desethylamiodarone serum concentrations from previous levels. Rifampin had been added to her therapy 5 weeks earlier. Increases in amiodarone and desethylamiodarone concentrations were observed after an increase in the amiodarone dosage and discontinuation of rifampin. The time course suggested that the addition of rifampin led to reductions in serum concentrations of both the drug and metabolite.

Abstract: Hyperpigmentation is a side effect of several medications, including amiodarone, bleomycin, chlorpromazine, and minocycline.
The purpose of this study is to describe the clinical and light microscopic findings in 4 patients with imipramine-induced hyperpigmentation and to better understand its origin.
All 4 patients underwent a skin biopsy for light microscopy. In 1 patient, a biopsy specimen was obtained for electron microscopy. Tissue from patient 1 was analyzed with a mass spectrophotometer, and energy-dispersive x-ray analysis was performed on tissue from patients 1 and 2.
All 4 women had been taking imipramine for at least 2 years. Hyperpigmentation occurred in a photodistribution on the face, arms, and backs of the hands. Light microscopy in all cases demonstrated golden-brown granules in the superficial dermis, which were strongly positive for Fontana-Masson stain. Electron microscopy demonstrated areas of electron-dense inclusion bodies within macrophages, which were distinct from melanosomes. Mass spectrophotometric and energy-dispersive x-ray analysis of the electron-dense bodies showed the presence of sulfur atoms, and no peak corresponding to that expected for imipramine was found. A peak closely corresponding to phaeomelanin, a sulfur-containing compound, was found.
Hyperpigmentation is a side effect of long-term imipramine use. It may result from the deposition of melanin in an unusual form. The melanin pigment is possibly complexed with a metabolite of imipramine, and does not represent the deposition of imipramine in its native form.

Abstract: We report a case of a 63-year-old women with Chagas' disease and recurrent, syncopal VT treated by RF catheter ablation in whom endocardial application of RF energy was guided by nonsurgical epicardial mapping. The procedure was undertaken in the electrophysiology laboratory under deep anesthesia. VT was interrupted after 2.4 seconds of application and rendered noninducible afterwards. Two weeks after the procedure, a distinct morphology VT was induced by programmed ventricular stimulation, and the patient was started on amiodarone, remaining asymptomatic 12 months after the procedure.

Abstract: Since amiodarone was first marketed in 1992 in Japan, the incidence of amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) has been increasing. Among 12 thyrotoxic patients, a patient with arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia, who had been taking amiodarone for 4 years, developed thyrotoxicosis with subacute onset, accompanied by transiently positive thyrotropin (TSH) receptor antibody (TRAb), or thyrotropin-binding inhibiting immunoglobulin (TBII). The immunoglobulin G (IgG) obtained from the TRAb-positive serum of the patient elicited no thyroid hormone-releasing activity in cultured human thyroid follicles, whereas all IgGs obtained from untreated Graves' disease elicited positive results. These in vitro findings and clinical course suggest that TRAb/TBII without thyroid-stimulating activity may develop in patients with amiodarone-induced destructive thyroiditis, as reported in patients with destructive thyroiditis, such as subacute and silent thyroiditis.

Abstract: This report describes two patients with recent stroke who, upon transfer to the rehabilitation medicine service, were noted to have extrapyramidal features. Both patients were receiving amiodarone for management of atrial fibrillation. When this medication was discontinued, there was slow resolution of extrapyramidal features and an improvement in function. Physicians managing acute stroke patients should be alert for features of amiodarone neurotoxicity, because these side effects may occur more readily in patients with recent neurologic impairment and may impede their progress in rehabilitation.

Abstract: Ventricular tachycardia has been reported after blunt cardiac trauma in both children and adults. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no reports of sudden onset of ventricular tachycardia at the time of surgical closure of gastroschisis. This case describes a patient with gastroschisis who developed a medically resistant ventricular tachycardia upon reduction of the gastroschisis.

Abstract: The introduction of transmyocardial laser revascularization for ischaemic heart disease has brought with it new challenges for anaesthetists. These include acute deterioration of cardiac function, the need for emergency cardiopulmonary bypass and difficulty weaning from haemodynamic support. Recurrent arrhythmias can occur despite amiodarone prophylaxis. We describe our initial experience and the problems we encountered.

Abstract: The clinical syndrome "Bronchiolitis Obliterans Organising Pneumonia" (BOOP) has to be considered in patients with a flu-like illness since some weeks, fine crackles, and on chest X-ray bilateral patchy infiltrates. There is no response to antibiotics. BOOP is essentially idiopathic, but associations to other conditions exist. Lung function is often restrictive; biochemistry is not pathognomonic. BAL shows a mixed cellular pattern. The gold standard for pathologic diagnosis is open or thoracoscopic lung biopsy. However, a BOOP pattern or reaction is often seen on histologic specimens without the clinical-radiologic features of the BOOP-entity. Therapy consists of corticosteroids, which have to be prescribed for a long time at a rather high dose. Recurrence is frequent, but prognosis is good. Evolution to respiratory insufficiency and death is rare and may occur in rapidly progressive BOOP. This study reports on 11 cases (6 males/5 females) of clinical-pathological BOOP-syndrome (mean age 58 yrs, range 17-73 yrs), with an unexpectedly high mortality rate of 36% (4 cases). The disease was idiopathic in 7, and was associated with intake of amiodarone (in 1), with past Mycoplasma pneumonia (in 1) and with connective tissue disease (in 2). There was a history of a flu-like syndrome, cough and dyspnea of a mean duration of 4 months (range 1 week to 8 months). Lung function was mostly restrictive or/and obstructive with a diffusing capacity ranging between 47 and 95% predicted; there was hypoxia in about half of the patients. Chest X-ray and computed tomography (CT) scan showed a patchy consolidation with linear opacities (unilateral in 4 patients, bilateral in 5) and/or a ground glass pattern (in 4 patients), and a focal pseudo-tumoral lesion (in 1). Bronchoalveolar lavage showed a variable pattern of mixed, or eosinophilic or neutrophilic alveolitis. Histologic diagnosis was based on open lung biopsy (in 3), on thoracoscopic biopsy (in 2), on transbronchial biopsy (in 2), on wedge resection of the nodular lesion (in 1) and on postmortem lung biopsy (in 3). One patient recovered spontaneously, 1 remained cured after resection of the focal lesion, 7 were treated with 16-125 mg methylprednisolone (of whom 3 had a temporary flare-up during tapering the corticosteroids and 2 died after 1 and 3 months due to infectious complications), 2 died due to rapidly progressive BOOP.

Abstract: Amiodarone is a benzofuran derivative with a chemical structure similar to thyroxine. Originally introduced to treat angina pectoris, amiodarone was found to have antiarrhythmic properties, and in 1985, was approved in the United States for treatment of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. It is now used for various ventricular and supraventricular arrhythmias refractory to conventional first-line medications, and as a result, side effects have been observed with increased frequency. The most severe and potentially life-threatening of these side effects is the development of pulmonary toxicity. Typically, amiodarone pulmonary toxicity (APT) is manifested by acute pneumonitis and chronic fibrosis. Amiodarone-associated hemoptysis (AAH) is a rare occurrence. The authors describe a case of AAH successfully treated with cessation of drug and steroid therapy.

Abstract: Amiodarone (AMD) is an antiarrhythmic drug which contains 37% of iodine. It can reach the fetus by transplacental passage and induce fetal hypothyroidism. Since in some pregnant women AMD represents a cardinal therapeutic opportunity, it is necessary to establish not only the risk of teratogenicity linked to fetal AMD exposure but also to evaluate the psychomotor development of children with neonatal thyroid dysfunction related to fetal AMD exposure. We report on two cases involving children with an AMD gestational exposure and transient neonatal hypothyroidism, who were followed-up until the age of 4 years 8 months and 5 years 6 months, respectively. Denver's developmental milestone test and Whechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI) were administered to the patients in accordance to their age. A normal psychomotor development was observed in both patients with full scale IQ score, verbal and performance IQ scores within normal range. In conclusion, if these data were validated by larger studies, it might not be obligatory to discontinue AMD administration in cardiopathic pregnant women, since mental impairment may not necessarily occur in children with transient neonatal hypothyroidism caused by fetal AMD exposure. However, the evaluation of the thyroid function of these children is imperative.

Abstract: One of the most serious side effects of amiodarone (an antiarrhythmic drug) is pulmonary toxicity. Bronchiolitis obliterans organising pneumonia has only very rarely been described as associated with treatment with amiodarone. In this article we describe a case of bronchiolitis obliterans organising pneumonia secondary to amiodarone.

Abstract: Metastatic tumors of the ventricles may cause symptomatic ventricular tachycardia such as described in this 66-year-old man, who presented with recurrent presyncope. The tumor may be readily diagnosed by 2-dimensional echocardiography, ultrafast computed tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging. Such tumors usually indicate an advanced stage of disease, and curative treatment is rarely possible. However, in this patient, effective control of the arrhythmia was achieved with a moderate dosage of oral amiodarone (600 mg daily for 4 weeks, then 400 mg daily), and he had no further episodes of presyncope. This report shows that the effectiveness of amiodarone in the control of symptomatic ventricular tachycardias may also extend to those that are probably secondary to metastatic tumors of the heart.

Abstract: We report a case of a patient with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and recurrent ventricular tachycardias refractory to antiarrhythmic treatment with amiodarone. A cardioverter defibrillator implantation was performed by the transvenous technique, but ventricular tachycardia detection resulted to be inappropriate because of constant double sensing of ventricular tachycardia electrograms (QRS width=250 ms). Device programmability didn't allow a satisfactory solution to this problem, therefore a more appropriate sensing system was considered. Through an anterior thoracotomy two epicardial wires were positioned and sensing by these wires, placed closer to ventricular tachycardia origin, resulted appropriate. An electrophysiologic study and subsequent follow up confirmed appropriate ICD detection of ventricular tachycardias. This case emphasizes how in some cases sensing by epicardial wires may be a solution for QRS double counting occurring with endocardial leads during ventricular tachycardia.

Abstract: A patient with repaired tetralogy of Fallot presented with recurrent syncope and had multiple haemodynamically unstable ventricular tachycardias unresponsive to antiarrhythmic medications. Ventricular tachycardias became haemodynamically tolerated with amiodarone, procainamide and dopamine, permitting activation and entrainment mapping. Radiofrequency ablation of three tachycardia circuits was performed. Ventricular tachycardia could not be induced 1 week, and 3 and 9 months later. Radiofrequency ablation is feasible for multiple, haemodynamically unstable ventricular tachycardias in repaired tetralogy of Fallot.

Abstract: We report a case of pulmonary fibrosis in an infant receiving amiodarone for treatment of intractable atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia secondary to Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. At 9 months, a screening chest radiograph showed a diffuse interstitial infiltrate in an asymptomatic, thriving infant. Amiodarone was discontinued and the pulmonary fibrosis resolved gradually over 6 months. This case documents the first report of amiodarone induced pulmonary fibrosis in the pediatric age group. We speculate that as amiodarone is used more frequently to manage pediatric arrhythmias, pulmonary fibrosis, a known complication of this antiarrhythmia in adults may be seen with increasing frequency in children.

Abstract: Alveolar macrophages are almost invariably present in percutaneous fine-needle aspiration cytology of the lung. They may predominate, appear foamy and finely vesiculated, or may reflect the cellular composition of the lung mass lesion. In a review of 172 cases of "negative for malignant cells" from the percutaneous lung fine-needle aspiration cytology file in an 8-year period at Hines VA Hospital, the vacuolated macrophages were evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively. Among the 53 cases (34%) showing vacuolated macrophages, only 5-25% of the cells were multivesiculated, the cytoplasmic vacuoles were few, focal, and occasionally global, and the majority of the vacuolated macrophages contained anthracotic or hemosiderin pigments. One case exhibited striking multivesiculation in at least 95% of macrophages and also in bronchial and alveolar cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial and inflammatory cells, a finding consistent with amiodarone toxicity (index case 1). The diagnosis was confirmed on subsequent transbronchial lung biopsy. In another patient with clinical HIV infection, the multivesiculation was also seen in 95% of the macrophages with associated acute inflammatory exudate, coccobacilli, and a positive culture for Rhodococcus equi (index case 2). In most cases, the vacuolated macrophages are reactive and inflammatory. Occasionally, as in our index cases they may actually indicate a specific diagnosis.

Abstract: Amiodarone is an antiarrythmic agent, which is often successfully used when all other antiarrythmics have failed. Sterile epididymitis is a recognized complication of treatment in adults, occurring in up to 11% of patients. To date there have been no reported cases of amiodarone induced epididymitis in children. We present a previously unrecognized cause of epididymitis in boys.
The medical records, including radiographic imaging, pathology and operative reports, of 2 postpubertal boys who had sterile epididymitis after prolonged therapy with amiodarone were reviewed.
In both cases the onset of scrotal pain and subsequent evaluation led to diagnosis of epidydimitis. Amiodarone was determined to be the cause, and cessation of the drug resulted in symptom resolution in 1 case.
While it remains uncertain, the pathophysiology of amiodarone induced epididymitis is likely related to its high concentration in testicular tissue. Recognition that amiodarone is a rare but significant cause of epididymitis in children is important to prevent unnecessary surgery in high risk patients. Amiodarone induced epididymitis in children tends to be a self-limited process and of secondary importance to the serious cardiac disease. Whereas discontinuing amiodarone risks sudden cardiac death, a reduction in dosage or temporary cessation of the drug may result in rapid resolution of the epididymitis.

Abstract: The courses of two neonates treated with intravenous amiodarone for supraventricular tachyarrhythmia, both of whom developed significant adverse effects, are reported. A 13-day-old term newborn developed hypothyroidism after 27 days of mostly intravenous amiodarone for atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia and severe heart failure. A one-day-old, 36 weeks' gestation newborn developed electromechanical dissociation after receiving an intravenous bolus of amiodarone for rapid atrial flutter. Judicious use of amiodarone is recommended.

Abstract: A 64-year-old man developed a fulminant hepatitis 4 days after initiation of amiodarone treatment and a total dose of 7.1 g. The direct Coombs test was positive and became negative again soon after stopping treatment. Immediately after stopping treatment the extremely increased parameters of hepatic failure returned to normal again. A rechallenge with 200 mg of amiodarone was accompanied by a positive Coombs test which again became negative after several days. We conclude that the occurrence of an acute hepatitis soon after initiation of amiodarone treatment is mediated by immunological mechanisms. There should be high vigilance with respect to this rare life-threatening adverse drug reaction.

Abstract: A 51 year old male received an orthotopic transplant because of end stage ischaemic heart disease. The donor was a healthy male teenager with no history of arrhythmias or other cardiac conditions. The patient presented with haemodynamically stable tachycardia and dyspnoea five weeks post-transplant. The ECG showed a regular tachycardia of 140 beats/min with a right bundle branch block morphology, left axis deviation, and a QRS duration of 135 ms. There were independent P waves, capture, and fusion beats confirming the diagnosis of ventricular tachycardia. Endomyocardial biopsy showed moderate focal rejection that was thought to be responsible for the arrhythmia. During the following six months the patient had recurrent tachyarrhythmias; on each occasion the ECG morphology was the same and there was no cellular rejection. The patient continued to have frequent hospital admissions with ventricular tachycardia requiring DC cardioversion despite the empirical use of amiodarone, sotalol, disopyramide, and procainamide. Eighteen months after transplantation the diagnosis of fascicular tachycardia was suspected by ECG morphology and supported by successful termination with intravenous verapamil. The arrhythmia was successfully managed by radiofrequency ablation. This patient shows that arrhythmias following transplantation are not always related to rejection, and that other potentially reversible causes should be considered, particularly when the ECG during arrhythmia conforms to a classic configuration.

Abstract: A 26 year old woman with a diagnosis of limb girdle muscular dystrophy and peripartum cardiomyopathy underwent orthotopic heart transplantation using standard atrial anastomoses. Recurrent atrial flutter was demonstrated in the absence of histological evidence of cellular rejection. Radiofrequency ablation of the flutter circuit was successfully performed allowing the avoidance of long term antiarrhythmic therapy. Ten weeks following ablation and cessation of amiodarone, presyncopal symptoms were found, associated with daytime and nocturnal sinus pauses of 2.9 seconds and 4.2 seconds, respectively. There was no evidence of AV node conduction impairment. In view of the continued absence of cellular rejection and the evident denervated state of the heart, the pauses reflected significant donor sinus node dysfunction; therefore, an AAIR permanent pacing system was implanted. At the time of pacemaker implantation atrial pacing at 150 beats/min did not produce significant PR interval prolongation or AV block. This case serves to advise rigorous follow up in such patients to continue to seek evidence of sinus node dysfunction potentially requiring permanent pacemaker implantation.

Abstract: We report a rare case of a 41-year-old male patient, a professional musician, with dilated cardiomyopathy and sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) that was refractory to class I antiarrhythmic drugs. Severe myolysis developed after 10 months' administration of amiodarone (400 mg/day) in combination with mexiletine (300 mg/day) and disopyramide (400 mg/day). He had been suffering from severe moving muscle pain and an extremely high (16,830) IU/ml) serum level of creatine kinase (CK). The dosage of amiodarone was reduced from 400 mg/day to 200 mg/day without reduction of mexiletine or disopyramide and the patient's symptoms diminished. However, sustained VT developed, and so the dosage of the drug was increased to 250 mg/day. The high serum level of CK also decreased and returned to the normal range after the reduction in amiodarone dosage. Electrophysiologic examination of moving muscle revealed normal motor and sensory conduction velocities and, furthermore, the electromyogram revealed normal potentials and normal motor units. We conclude that severe myolysis developed as a result of the high dose and chronic administration of amiodarone. This is the first report of a Japanese patient showing rare and serious adverse effects in response to amiodarone treatment.

Abstract: Amiodarone hydrochloride is classified as a Vaughan Williams class III antiarrhythmic agent, although class I, II, and IV effects may contribute to its favorable antiarrhythmic profile. It is associated with a wide variety of adverse effects, such as hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, interstitial pulmonary disease, hepatitis, coagulation disorders, skin photosensitivity, corneal microdeposits, alopecia, peripheral neuropathy, and cardiovascular arrhythmias.
Bone marrow aspirations and biopsies were performed on two patients treated with amiodarone, on the first during a follow-up for myelofibrosis and on the second for a suspected lymphoproliferative disorder. Several bone marrow granulomas were found in both patients. The bone marrow specimens for tuberculosis and fungal stains were negative.
The temporal relationship between the amoidarone therapy and the development of two cases of asymptomatic bone marrow granuloma suggest the possibility that this antiarrhythmic agent is involved in the etiology of these granulomas.

Abstract: The role of increased dispersion of repolarization in the genesis of torsades de pointes in patients with long QT syndrome has been clarified, but its role in the genesis of idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (VF) is not yet known. To investigate the pathogenesis of VF, we recorded monophasic action potentials (MAPs) from two siblings (48- and 36-year-old males) with familial idiopathic VF.
The elder brother (patient 1) showed a late r' wave in lead V1 and ST segment elevation in leads V1 through V3. The younger brother (patient 2) had late r' waves and ST segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF, and the configurations were very similar to those of patient 1. MAPs were recorded from several sites in the right ventricular (RV) and left ventricular (LV) endocardium during constant right atrial pacing. The repolarization time (RT) was defined as the sum of the activation time (AT) and action potential duration (APD) at 90% repolarization. In patient 1, marked prolongation of the AT (140 msec) and the RT (380 msec) was recorded in the RV septum of the outflow tract, and the RT dispersion was markedly increased (125 msec). In contrast, patient 2 showed prolongation of the AT (80 msec) and RT (310 msec), and fractionated electrograms in the RV floor of the inflow tract. The RT dispersion was also increased (80 msec). VF and nonsustained polymorphic ventricular tachycardia were induced by double premature stimulation in patients 1 and 2, respectively. Chronic amiodarone therapy decreased the RT dispersion and suppressed the induction of ventricular tachyarrhythmias in patient 2, although late r' waves and slight ST segment elevation were unmasked in leads V1 and V2.
Our data suggest that the increased dispersion of the RT, which was due mainly to a localized conduction delay in the RV, created an arrhythmogenic substrate in the two patients with familial idiopathic VF.

Abstract: To show lipid deposits in the lung of patients treated with amiodarone.
Formalin-fixed, unstained frozen sections were used to reveal lipid deposits by means of polarized light. Lung tissues obtained at the postmortem examination of one patient and the surgical biopsy of another were available.
Birefringent lipid deposits were seen in the alveolar lining cells and macrophages, as well as in the walls of arterioles and venules.
To assess the effect of amiodarone on the lung, polarized light microscopy of unstained, frozen sections is a simple and rapid method.

Abstract: We report a case of amiodarone induced torsades de pointes (TdP) associated with increase QT dispersion in a patient with a history of quinidine induced TdP. An increase in QT dispersion of > 100% was noted on the 12 lead surface ECG postamiodarone therapy. In summary, amiodarone has a potential to induce TdP in patients with a previous history of quinidine induced TdP. QT dispersion could be a potential marker of TdP in these patients.

Abstract: A case of extraocular muscle enlargement diagnosed 2 months after the start of treatment with amiodarone is presented. The orbital CT scan was typical of endocrine ophthalmopathy. The patient had no history of hyperthyroidism and during a follow-up period of 2 years no laboratory evidence of irregularities in the thyroid hormone metabolism was discovered.

Abstract: A case is presented in which amiodarone was administered to suppress paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in a patient with an idiopathic cardiomyopathy. Eleven days after initiation of therapy with amiodarone, the patient experienced syncope and was noted to have recurrent episodes of polymorphous ventricular tachycardia. The patient was hospitalized and treated with a bolus as well as continuous infusion of intravenous magnesium sulfate. When the infusion was transiently discontinued, recurrences of polymorphous ventricular tachycardia were noted. The probable proarrhythmic action of amiodarone, although rare, is reviewed along with a discussion of the novel use of intravenous magnesium sulfate therapy.

Abstract: Amiodarone is useful in the treatment of patients with ventricular arrhythmias after acute myocardial infarction and was equally useful when these arrhythmias were associated with CHF. Amiodarone prolongs repolarization and lowers heart rate, actions that are beneficial in treating symptomatic arrhythmias. The absence of proarrhythmic effects distinguishes amiodarone from other antiarrhythmic agents. No excess mortality was seen in any of the amiodarone trials, and in fact, a definite trend toward a decrease in the number of sudden deaths was noted. For many years, amiodarone has been the antiarrhythmic drug of choice in Europe. Only in recent years has this drug gained respectability in the United States. Amiodarone is truly a late comer to our shores.

Abstract: We describe a patient who was treated with amiodarone for ventricular arrhythmia based on arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia and who subsequently developed severe amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis. Discontinuation of amiodarone resulted in sustained ventricular tachycardia, which was successfully treated with a DC electrical shock, and subsequently atrial fibrillation, leading to brain embolism due to occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery. Combination treatment with amiodarone and prednisolone was effective both in reducing the serum concentration of thyroid hormones and in improving the patient's general condition. As the use of amiodarone becomes more widespread, treatment with prednisolone for this kind of thyrotoxicosis, which is resistant to conventional treatment, will be required increasingly frequently because iodine overload of the thyroid gland persists for some time after discontinuation of amiodarone treatment.

Abstract: Torsade de pointes is a potentially lethal ventricular arrhythmia that is associated with prolonged QT intervals and is often caused by drugs that prolong repolarization. Among the most common drugs that may cause torsade de pointes are antiarrhythmic drugs including quinidine, procainamide, sotalol and newer class III antiarrhythmic agents. The incidence of torsade de pointes associated with amiodarone, however, is reported to be much lower. A case is reported of amiodarone-induced torsade de pointes following the development of the same arrhythmia during beta-blocker use. This case illustrates that although the reported incidence of torsade de pointes during amiodarone therapy is low, patients with bradycardia-induced torsade de pointes may be a subgroup of patients who are at increased risk of this arrhythmia with amiodarone.

Abstract: Cardiac hemochromatosis can cause heart failure and cardiac arrhythmias. Among these arrhythmias, ventricular tachycardia may be resistant to treatment. A case of cardiac hemochromatosis complicated with ventricular tachycardia that did not respond to intravenous lidocaine, procainamide or propafenone, nor to DC cardioversion, was successfully treated with amiodarone. Amiodarone, a class III antiarrhythmic drug, may be highly effective in similar cases.

Abstract: Amiodarone is a drug broadly used on cardiac arrhythmias despite its multiple side-effects. We present the case of an adult male with symptomatic ventricular tachycardia, receiving longterm amiodarone, who showed increased CK serum levels, sensorimotor neuropathy and secondary myopathy. Quadriceps biopsy showed atrophic changes and sural nerve intralysosomal deposits with intense axonal degeneration. The case illustrates the need to investigate and monitor peripheral neuropathy and muscular atrophy in chronic amiodarone use.

Abstract: We report four cases of difficult defaecation and/or faecal incontinence revealing a neurologic disease. These anorectal symptoms were associated with urinary disorders, but urinary symptoms always appeared several years after anorectal complaints. Clinical neurologic examination immediately led us to suspect a neurologic aetiology in two patients with the following signs: perineal hypoesthesia, absence of voluntary anal contraction and anal reflexes in one subject (final diagnosis: L1 neurinoma), and in the other a weakness in both thighs with absent tendon reflexes in the four limbs (final diagnosis: amiodarone neuropathy). In the two other patients with multiple cerebral infarction or multiple system atrophy, the neurologic aetiology was suspected on the absence of anal voluntary contraction contrasting with a normal perineal anatomy, but the final diagnosis was made only two years later when orthostatic arterial hypotension occurred.

Abstract: The most common lung tissue reaction to amiodarone toxicity is a nonspecific pulmonary chronic interstitial pneumonia. In a minority of patients diffuse alveolar damage, alveolar haemorrhage or bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP) is encountered. We report the case of a patient with clinical, functional, radiological and histological signs of BOOP secondary to amiodarone. The condition was partially reversible after suspending drug treatment, and resolved after corticosteroid treatment without relapse after a 14 month follow-up.

Abstract: There is a limited experience with catheter ablation for treatment of ventricular tachycardia (VT) in Chagasic cardiomyopathy. A 30-year-old woman experienced episodes of palpitations and syncope due to attacks of VT. A diagnosis of Chagas disease was established on a biological basis. Two-dimensional echo and contrast ventriculography showed an apical aneurysm with thrombus. Surgery was indicated to resect the aneurysm and ablate the VT. Ventricular tachycardia recurred 1 month later despite therapy, including amiodarone. Two clinical frequent and well-tolerated tachycardias were identified. The site of origin was located in the right ventricular apex and in the apical-lateral wall of the left ventricle, respectively. Catheter ablation was performed at two sites with DC shocks (total energy 600 J) after unsuccessful radiofrequency ablation. Holter recordings performed during the post-operative period showed only infrequent extrasystoles. After follow-up of 24 months the patient remains asymptomatic. Drug-refractory VT in Chagasic cardiomyopathy can be ablated by medium-energy DC shocks after failure of radiofrequency ablation.

Abstract: Two members of a family with (autosomal dominant) dilated cardiomyopathy and symptomatic short-lasting ventricular tachyarrhythmias were each treated with an ICD in the course of their disease. One patient had an episode of torsades de pointes induced by amiodarone, and the ICD failed to recognize some events. Cardiac arrest recurred in this setting. Treatment with bisoprolol was helpful in maintaining an acceptable functional status and in preventing multiple shocks until transplantation became mandatory. Bisoprolol was not tolerated by the second patient, who had several episodes of syncope because of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. His functional course went downhill fast, and he received a heart transplantation 16 months after implantation of an ICD, which had not delivered any shocks, in spite of one symptomatic short ventricular tachycardia.

Abstract: We report a case of amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis of protracted duration, unresponsive to conventional thionamide therapy, with therapy limited by severe adverse drug reactions. Other treatment modalities included high dose corticosteroids, plasmapheresis, lithium and perchlorate. Temporary amelioration was achieved following plasmapheresis; however, this and other measures were unsuccessful in controlling the thyrotoxicosis, which deteriorated to thyroid storm. Histopathologically, a degenerative, inflammatory thyroiditis was evident. We discuss the limitations of conventional drug therapy and the lack of a sustained response to plasmapheresis. The failure of high doses steroids to alter the course of illness and to completely suppress the thyroidal inflammatory process is highlighted. A potential role for renal and hepatic impairment in the observed protracted course of amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis is suggested.

Abstract: Amiodarone is reported to have a low incidence of proarrhythmic effects. They generally occur during chronic treatment in association with increase in amiodarone dosage, electrolyte disorders, or concomitant therapy with class IA antiarrhythmic drugs. We describe a case of amiodarone-induced torsade de pointes early after initiation of low-dose oral therapy, in absence of other predisposing factors.

Abstract: A 66-year-old man suffering from atrial flutter developed cutaneous blue-gray pigmentation while receiving 600 mg of amiodarone daily for 15 months. With reduction of the dose to 100 mg, skin discoloration disappeared within 16 months, to reappear within 7 months after increasing the dose to 400 mg. Finally, the discoloration disappeared within 13 months with a dose reduction to 200 mg daily. It seems that a tissue threshold level for amiodarone exists in this patient, above which skin discoloration appears and below which it fades. Dose, duration, metabolism, macrophage transfer, and spillover saturation-excretion may be relevant in amiodarone-induced skin pigmentation.

Abstract: A case of mitral stenosis following mitral valve replacement in a patient with endocardial fibroelastosis is reported. A 14-year-old boy presented with cardiac failure. He had been diagnosed as having endocardial fibroelastosis at the age of 7 months and had undergone resection of endocardial fibrous tissue in the left ventricle at that time. Five years later his mitral valve was resected owing to mitral stenosis, with Bjork-Shiley valve replacement. Cross-sectional echocardiography on this admission showed restrictive left ventricular inflow due to a thickened immobile prosthetic valve with severely dyskinetic left ventricle (ejection fraction 8%). The electrocardiogram showed atrioventricular reentry tachycardia. Despite direct current cardioversion and continual amiodarone infusion he suffered a cardiac arrest and died 12 days after admission. Postmortem examination showed left ventricular endocardial fibroelastosis with severe inflow obstruction due to the formation of a complete fibrous ring of pannus/fibrosis around the prosthetic margin on the ventricular aspect of the left ventricle. This complication has not previously been described in children after mitral valve replacement.

Abstract: We present a patient who developed a unilateral, exudative pleural effusion without concomitant pulmonary parenchymal disease while being treated with amiodarone. Previous attempts to discontinue amiodarone therapy and substitute alternative antiarrhythmics resulted in recurrence of life-threatening arrhythmias. We chose to continue amiodarone and observe the response to a brief course of oral corticosteroids. The pleural effusion resolved quickly and had not recurred after 36 months of observation.

Abstract: There have been no specific exercise or daily activity guidelines determined for patients with automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillators. Two patients, one with a Ventritex Cadence Model V-100 defibrillator and one with a CPI Ventak Model 1550 defibrillator were enrolled in monitored cardiac rehabilitation. One patient had symptoms of syncope and cardiodefibrillation during a vigorous short walk prior to cardiac rehabilitation and became fearful of any activity. Stress testing on this patient was terminated early because his atrial fibrillation rate approached the defibrillization rate. A low dose of beta blockade was added to his regimen. He underwent repeat stress testing and was placed in cardiac rehabilitation. This patient had no further shocks, and it was assumed that his shock was due to high atrial fibrillation rates. The second patient experienced recurrent shocks on amiodarone, propafenone, and mexiletine with presyncope. However, stress testing did not disclose abnormalities. The patient was fearful of any activity and was placed in cardiac rehabilitation. During an average of 26 sessions of cardiac rehabilitation, no symptoms have been noted, and the patients have returned to a more normal lifestyle. Specific exercise and lifestyle criteria should be given to patients with cardioverter defibrillators. Stress testing with monitored exercise can develop such a program. Larger numbers of patients need to be studied.

Abstract: In adult patients, the combination of severe aortic valve stenosis and coarctation is rare. Surgical options comprise either a two-stage approach with valve replacement and subsequent repair of the coarctation or a one-stage repair involving valve replacement and insertion of an extraanatomic bypass graft from the ascending to the descending aorta.
We report the cases of 2 adult patients with this combined lesion who underwent simultaneous aortic valve replacement and transpericardial bypass of the coarctation.
Weaning from extracorporeal circulation and restoration of spontaneous circulation required resuscitative measures. By increasing mean arterial perfusion pressure using norepinephrine, the observed hemodynamic instability could be controlled effectively.
Changes in the hemodynamics of the thoracic vascular bed resulting in coronary malperfusion are discussed to be the major cause of heart failure and life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias seen in our patients after aortic valve replacement and insertion of an ascending-descending aorta bypass graft. Awareness of the complications described is considered important for successful management of these high-risk patients.

Abstract: A case of idiopathic ventricular tachycardia of left ventricular origin in a hydropic fetus is presented. The accuracy of fetal echocardiography for diagnosing this type of arrhythmia is emphasized, as is its importance in determining appropriate postnatal treatment which in this case resulted in an unusually benign course.

Abstract: We report the successful management of recurrent ventricular tachycardias in a newborn suffering from an intracardiac tumor. Amiodarone was the only agent able to control the tachycardias and did so as long as an individually titrated plasma concentration above 0.8 mu mol/L was maintained. Because no therapeutic plasma concentration has been defined in children and no kinetic studies are available in this population, we optimized the dosing regimen based on a computer simulation, taking into account the pharmacokinetic parameters of the patient and the individual concentration-effect relation.

Abstract: Sinus node dysfunction is a well-known occurrence following orthotopic heart transplantation, but atrioventricular block is rarely described. We compare the incidence and clinical presentation of atrioventricular block and sinus node dysfunction among the first 200 consecutive patients receiving heart transplantation at the University of Utah. Two of 200 patients (1%) required pacemaker implantation for symptomatic atrioventricular block compared to 13 of 200 (6.5%) who required pacemaker for symptomatic sinus node dysfunction. Of the patients with atrioventricular block, one had intermittent Mobitz II second-degree atrioventricular block and one had high grade atrioventricular block without ventricular escape. The most striking difference between the patients with atrioventricular block and those with sinus node dysfunction was the interval between transplantation and pacemaker implantation; time to pacemaker implantation in the atrioventricular block patients was 955 and 810 days compared to a median time of 26 days for sinus node dysfunction patients (P = 0.037). The patients requiring permanent pacemaker implantation were similar to those not requiring pacemaker implantation with respect to age, sex, ischemic time, and donor age. None of the patients requiring permanent pacemaker implantation was on amiodarone therapy within 2 months of transplant.

Abstract: Amiodarone-induced chemical, sterile epididymitis has previously been reported. We present 2 cases who were on amiodarone therapy for refractory cardiac arrhythmia. Recognition of this side effect and treatment by lower drug dosage can prevent unnecessary antibiotic therapy and invasive urological procedures.

Abstract: Amiodarone, a widely used antiarrhythmic drug, is associated with pulmonary toxicity, with an estimated mortality of 1% to 33%. Standard treatment for amiodarone pulmonary toxicity (APT) has been discontinuance of the drug and steroid therapy. We report a case of APT that recurred after withdrawal of steroids and failed to respond to reinstatement of steroid therapy. Recurrent APT is a rare clinical entity that has been reported only twice in recent literature.

Abstract: Amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis occurs in 2-12.1% of patients on chronic amiodarone treatment. In most cases its pathogenesis is related to iodine overload in the presence of preexisting thyroid abnormalities, such as multinodular or diffuse goiter or autonomous nodule. A minority of patients show apparently normal glands or pictures of non-autoimmune thyroiditis. However, there is recent evidence of a direct toxic effect of amiodarone, with consequent release of iodothyronines into the circulation. We report a patient with amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis with toxic thyroid effects demonstrated by electron microscopy in a fine-needle aspiration biopsy. There were three main pathologic findings: multilamellar lysosomal inclusions, intramitchondrial glycogen inclusions--both ultrastructural findings indicating thyroid cell damage--and a microscopic morphological pattern of thyroid cell hyperfunction. No inflammatory changes were found. Plasma thyroglobulin levels were high. The patient proved to be a non responder to simultaneous administration of methimazole (starting dose 30 mg/day) and potassium perchlorate (1000 mg/day for 40 days), while still taking amiodarone, thus providing evidence against a possible pathogenetic role of iodine overload. Dexamethasone (starting dose 3 mg/day) was added to methimazole. After three months euthyroidism had been restored and plasma thyroglobulin level substantially decreased. Subsequent subclinical hypothyroidism developed, which persisted after stopping antithyroid treatment and required substitution treatment with levothyroxine. In view of the primary role of lysosome function in the proteolysis of thyroglobulin molecules and of the energy-requiring carrier-mediated transport of monoiodotyrosine across the lysosomal membrane for iodine salvage and reutilization, we suggest that the pathological lysosomal and mitochondrial changes observed could be an ultrastructural marker for subsequent hypothyroidism in amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis. Our observations suggest the usefulness of ultrastructural thyroid evaluation and serial plasma thyroglobulin determinations to thoroughly evaluate the underlying pathogenetic mechanisms in amiodarone-associated thyrotoxicosis with apparently normal thyroid glands. Moreover, more knowledge of its pathogenesis could improve both prognostic stratification and treatment guides.

Abstract: Trasodone, a second generation antidepressant, has been shown to equal standard tricyclics in clinical efficacy while causing significantly fewer cardiac side effects. Although clinical trials have demonstrated a relatively safe arrhythmogenic profile, trasodone has been implicated in the pathogenesis of ventricular arrhythmias. This report describes a patient in whom the administration of trasodone in addition to previously well-tolerated long-term amiodarone therapy was associated with a marked prolongation of the QT interval and polymorphous ventricular tachycardia. Caution in the concurrent use of trasodone and other medications known to cause QT prolongation and polymorphous ventricular tachycardia is recommended.

Abstract: Permanent junctional reciprocating tachycardia (PJRT) is a rare cause of supraventricular tachycardia in the pediatric population and is resistant to most pharmacological therapy. A case of supraventricular tachycardia that, on the basis of postnatal electrocardiographic and Holter monitor evidence, was diagnosed as PJRT and presented in utero as an atypical tachycardia with severe tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy confirmed postnatally is presented. It is the only case of which the authors are aware that was controlled in the neonatal period by amiodarone and that resulted in complete resolution of systolic dysfunction. The literature discussing how tachycardia may induce cardiomyopathy and the use of amiodarone in treatment both pre- and postnatally are reviewed.

Abstract: We studied a case of vortex keratopathy that was associated with the use of atovaquone.
A patient with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) with pulmonary Pneumocystis carinii was treated with 750 mg of atovaquone three times a day.
Similar to previous findings of drug-induced vortex keratopathy, atovaquone vortex keratopathy is presumably caused by its lipophilic properties. This property is similar to that of other lipophilic agents such as amiodarone, chloroquine, chlorpromazine, quinacrine, and suramin.
Atovaquone should be added to the list of agents causing vortex keratopathy involving the corneal epithelium.

Abstract: A case of jaundice due to canalicular cholestasis during amiodarone therapy is reported. A definite diagnosis was attained by ultrastructural evidence of a phospholipidosis pattern, a characteristic amiodarone-induced injury. Jaundice occurred within the third month of therapy. Serum bilirubin levels continued to increase in the two weeks following drug withdrawal. A slow decrease was observed in the following three months. Only four cases of jaundice associated with amiodarone therapy have been reported until now.

Abstract: Right bundle branch block, persistent ST segment elevation in right precordial leads and sudden cardiac death, unexplainable by currently known disease, define a new distinct clinical and electrocardiographic syndrome. This report describe a patient with these features, whose physical examination, echocardiography, chest computed tomography and right ventricular angiography were normal. However, despite the negativity of these examinations, cardiac nuclear magnetic resonance allowed the identification of right ventricular dysplasia. Thus, right ventricular dysplasia should be considered in the differential diagnosis of the syndrome characterized by right bundle branch block, persistent ST segment elevation and sudden cardiac death.

Abstract: 1. The concentrations of amiodarone/desethylamiodarone, digoxin, flecainide and sotalol were measured in serum collected immediately prior to death and in postmortem blood collected from the femoral vein and artery of an 18-year-old male with congenital heart disease who developed a fatal arrhythmia. 2. The concentrations of all four drugs in the sample collected during life were consistent with the dosage given and in the range accepted for normal therapy. 3. There were no differences in amiodarone/desethylamiodarone, flecainide and sotalol concentrations in arterial or venous postmortem blood. 4. The concentrations of desethylamiodarone, digoxin, flecainide and sotalol but not amiodarone, were higher in postmortem blood than in antemortem serum. The flecainide concentration was significantly greater than the upper limit associated with toxicity in life. Without knowledge of the true concentration measured in life, this apparently high, toxic concentration would have suggested that death could have resulted from arrhythmogenic/proarrhythmic effects of the drug in excess. 5. These results further demonstrate the hazards in interpreting postmortem blood concentrations following suspected drug intoxication.

Abstract: Fetal tachycardia sometimes is quite difficult to treat, especially when the fetus has congestive heart failure. Sustained supraventricular tachycardia and hydrops had been diagnosed in a fetus as early as the 27th week of gestational age. A variety of antiarrhythmic agents, including digoxin, digoxin in combination with quinidine or propranolol or verapamil, have been prescribed for the mother, always in a vain effort of conversion of the tachycardia. A baby was born via vaginal delivery at 35 weeks' gestation because of premature labor. The tachycardia disappeared immediately after birth, but several episodes of tachycardia occurred during the neonatal period, and were converted only by electric cardioversion or intravenous amiodarone. Oral amiodarone was then prescribed for three months to prevent recurrence. The baby has lived well without attacks during a one-and-a-half-year follow-up.

Abstract: Latissimus dorsi cardiomyoplasty is a promising surgical therapy in some patients with congestive heart failure. Although the mortality in heart failure patients is attributable primarily to heart failure and ventricular arrhythmias, the mechanism of death after cardiomyoplasty is not well characterized. We describe the clinical course of a patient undergoing cardiomyoplasty and discuss the role of combined use with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator. A 39-year-old man with congestive heart failure due to a massive anterior wall myocardial infarction was evaluated for latissimus dorsi cardiomyoplasty. The patient was in NYHA Functional Class III due to heart failure. He did not have any significant exertional or rest angina. During a Naughton stress test, the patient could exercise for 10 minutes, achieving 4 METS. Pulmonary function study showed a peak V O2 of 22.1 mL/min per kg. Radionuclide angiography demonstrated that the anterior wall was akinetic with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 22%. Cardiac hemodynamic studies suggested moderate pulmonary hypertension, elevated wedge pressure, and suboptimal response to exercise. A Holter recording showed frequent ventricular extrasystoles. Cardiomyoplasty was preferred to heart transplantation because the patient did not have end-stage heart failure. Postoperatively, the patient required low doses of dopamine. He developed recurrent, sustained, and hemodynamically significant episodes of ventricular tachycardia. He was treated with a combination of amiodarone and procainamide. He died 2 days postoperatively with ventricular fibrillation. Ventricular arrhythmias are a major cause of death in patients with heart failure. Latissimus dorsi cardiomyoplasty appears to be a promising but unproven therapy in such patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Abstract: Amiodarone is an iodinated benzofuran derivative that represents a new and extremely effective therapy for certain life-threatening refractory cardiac arrgythmia. There are numerous side effects associated with amiodarone therapy, including corneal microdeposits. Skin reactions and others. Pulmonary toxicity, however, represents the most serious adverse reaction limiting the clinical effecacy of this antidysrhythmic drug. Recently, we experienced a case of amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity confirmed by open lung biopsy with light-and electron-microscopy. So, we report a case of amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity with a literature review.

Abstract: To report a case of fatal hepatotoxicity associated with the chronic use of oral amiodarone.
Long-term administration of amiodarone for the control of intractable ventricular tachycardia was associated with fatal hepatotoxicity in a patient receiving amiodarone for 14 months.
Although most hepatic adverse effects associated with amiodarone are transient and reversible with time, deaths resulting from amiodarone-induced hepatotoxicity have been reported. The relation of hepatotoxicity to cumulative dose and duration of therapy is debated. The histopathologic features of amiodarone-induced hepatotoxicity include Mallory bodies, steatosis, intralobular inflammatory infiltrates, fibrosis, and phospholipidosis.
Evidence pertaining to both mild and severe amiodarone toxicity indicates that cumulative dose may correlate with overall toxicity and, therefore, maintenance doses should be kept as low as possible. Patients should be followed with monitoring of liver function test results every 3-6 months.

Abstract: Bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP) is a clinicopathological entity with well-defined diagnostic criteria, the aetiology of which is generally unknown. Among the adverse pulmonary effects of the drug amiodarone, BOOP is the least commonly reported in the literature. In this article we describe a case of amiodarone-induced BOOP.

Abstract: Antiarrhythmic agents may induce ventricular arrhythmias. Whereas amiodarone is a reported cause of ventricular fibrillation in children, there are no reported cases in infants. We observed two patients with atrial flutter and congestive heart failure who were treated with amiodarone. Both had anatomic heart defects and had failed conventional therapy. Ventricular fibrillation occurred 3 and 12 days after the initial dose. Q-T interval, electrolytes, digoxin level, and amiodarone level (one patient) were normal. Amiodarone may provoke life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias during the convalescent period. Consideration should be given to monitoring in a hospital setting for at least 2 weeks following initiation of amiodarone therapy.

Abstract: We report a 4-month-old infant with torsade de pointes secondary to procainamide treatment. The infant presented with atrial flutter and converted to normal sinus rhythm with intravenous procainamide. Oral procainamide therapy was initiated as the infusion was tapered, and the patient subsequently developed incessant torsade de pointes. Once the proarrhythmia was recognized, procainamide was withheld, and intravenous magnesium was administered. The torsade de pointes resolved after one bolus of magnesium sulfate. An infusion regimen of magnesium was given until the procainamide and N-acetylprocainamide concentrations became undetectable. Intravenous magnesium should be administered to newborns with acquired torsade de pointes; dosing guidelines for its use are suggested.

Abstract: A 66-year-old Indian male who had been treated for recurrent erythema nodosum leprosum with 300 mg of clofazimine per day for 11 months presented to hospital with a 4 week history of severe gastrointestinal upset. Soon after admission he developed several short runs of ventricular tachycardia with a morphology suggestive of torsade de pointe. The patient had a slightly low magnesium level which was corrected within 2 days; however, his rhythm disturbance persisted for 5 days despite management with intravenous lidocaine. His gastrointestinal symptoms abated 2 weeks after clofazimine was discontinued. Subsequent investigations showed that the patient had a keratopathy and myelin-type figures in his polymorphonuclear white cells similar to that seen with the cardiotoxic drugs chloroquine and amiodarone. It is postulated that clofazimine alone or in conjunction with electrolyte disturbance was responsible for the patient's cardiac arrythmia.

Abstract: A 33-year-old nullipara presented at 20 weeks' gestation with episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, which were controlled with amiodarone. No hypertension was recorded except once after an attack of ventricular tachycardia. Pheochromocytoma was suspected when repeat 24-hour urine catecholamine levels were markedly elevated. Neither computed tomography nor postpartum metaiodobenzylguanidine scan could locate the tumor. Finally it was identified in the bladder by ultrasound after selective venous sampling localized it to the pelvis. It was excised four months postpartum.

Abstract: Hemodynamically unstable ventricular arrhythmias induced during electrophysiologic testing almost always respond to prompt application of direct current transthoracic shocks. In rare cases, however, ventricular fibrillation may be refractory to conventional treatment. Recently, a technique of intracardiac defibrillation has been successfully used to resuscitate patients with ventricular fibrillation refractory to transthoracic defibrillation. We describe two patients with a history of myocardial infarction and left ventricular dysfunction who were admitted with symptomatic episodes of ventricular tachycardia. Both had inducible sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia. During a repeat electrophysiologic study in Patient No. 1 on procainamide and at the initial study in Patient No. 2, right ventricular burst pacing to terminate ventricular tachycardia resulted in ventricular fibrillation refractory to resuscitation efforts, including transthoracic defibrillation with 360 J. Emergency intracardiac defibrillation with 200 and 360 J, respectively, successfully converted both patients to sinus rhythm. Both patients were subsequently discharged from the hospital on amiodarone. These cases illustrate the life-saving capabilities of intracardiac defibrillation.

Abstract: We report the case of a 60-year-old man with long-standing symptomatic Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome who presented with recurrent syncope and documented spontaneous ventricular fibrillation. This primary ventricular fibrillation, which was not preceded by atrial fibrillation, was associated with lymphocytic myocarditis and not with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. The patient was treated with radiofrequency ablation of the accessory pathway and a drug regimen of prednisone, amiodarone, and metoprolol. At the 6-month follow-up, he was asymptomatic and had returned to work. To our knowledge, the association of acute lymphocytic myocarditis and Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome has not been previously reported.

Abstract: We report the case of a previously healthy 45-year-old white man in whom sustained ventricular tachycardia and severe myocardial dysfunction were the only signs of cardiac sarcoidosis. Diagnosis was confirmed by endomyocardial biopsy, and the patient responded well to treatment with amiodarone and prednisone.

Abstract: Catheter ablation of a case of incessant atrial fibrillation was attempted using linear right atrial lesions created by sequential applications of radiofrequency energy.
A 46-year-old patient had incessant episodes of atrial fibrillation. He had previously undergone successful radiofrequency catheter ablation of a common atrial flutter. Antiarrhythmic drugs including amiodarone and various drug combinations were ineffective. A 7-French specially designed 14-polar catheter with interelectrode distance of 3 mm was used to create linear lesions in the right atrium. Each electrode was 4 mm in length and able to transmit radiofrequency energy. Three linear lesions, two longitudinal and one transverse that connected the two longitudinal lesions, were created using 30 radiofrequency applications of 10 to 40 W. The final application interrupted an atrial fibrillation that had been persistent for 55 minutes. No sustained atrial fibrillation was inducible despite repeated pacing maneuvers. There was no complication. In short-term follow-up of 3 months, the patient has been free of arrhythmias without antiarrhythmic medication.
Successful catheter ablation of human atrial fibrillation is feasible using linear atrial lesions created by radiofrequency energy delivery. Further studies are mandatory to ascertain the efficacy and safety of this procedure, as well as to assess different catheter techniques.

Abstract: A patient with amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis and autonomous nodule was treated with percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI) in 8 sessions. Preinjection thyroid hormone levels showed a marked elevation, peaking before the third session. The thyroid hormone increments following each procedure never exceeded 20% of the preinjection levels. FT4 plasma levels thereafter declined to within the normal range by the sixth session (day 21), while FT3 levels, though markedly reduced, were still slightly elevated; also, the thyroid hormone increments following ethanol injection were not observed after the fifth session. These findings suggest that a significant, but not sustained, increase in thyroid hormone levels is induced by PEI and may account for the lack of acute deterioration of clinical status, which remained under control with medical treatment alone. Normal serum thyroid hormone levels were observed at the 3 and 12 month follow-up. The use of percutaneous ethanol injection therapy for amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism should be restricted to patients with preexisting thyroid hyperfunctioning nodule, and it may be a practical alternative to surgery in addition to medical treatment. Special caution should be exercised with patients with severe underlying heart disorders, since their clinical status might seriously worsen in case of acute elevations of serum thyroid hormones following ethanol injection. To this purpose, a close monitoring of serum thyroid hormones is recommended in order to institute a prompt adjustment in their medical therapy and/or in their PEI protocol.

Abstract: The prognosis of systemic sclerosis (SSc) is poor, and a significant number of patients suffer sudden death, probably related to malignant ventricular arrhythmias for which there is no reliable drug treatment. We describe a patient with SSc who had 2 documented episodes of ventricular fibrillation, that reverted after electrical defibrillation. An electrophysiological study performed after 3 weeks of oral loading with amiodarone 1200 mg/day, demonstrated the induction of unstable sustained syncopal ventricular tachycardia. She has been successfully controlled with the implant of a 3rd generation implantable cardioverter defibrillator. We suggest that this treatment should be seriously considered in those patients with SSc and malignant ventricular arrhythmias unresponsive to drug therapy.

Abstract: A sixty-year-old man who presented with dyspnea and palpitations was investigated in this institution and was found to have dextrocardia, single aortic coronary ostium, severe aortic regurgitation, and atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia.

Abstract: A report is given on a 59-year-old female who acquired a wet maculopathy in her only seeing eye during amiodarone therapy given for a cardiac disorder. After withdrawal of the drug and subsequent central retinal laser therapy her visual acuity stabilized at 0.7 (follow-up time 6 years). With no similar reports in literature, it is suggested that the association between amiodarone therapy and the central retinopathy was accidental only.

Abstract: Amiodarone is a valuable agent, used in the management of intractable cardiac arrhythmias. Its widespread use persists despite a list of well recognized side-effects. Skin reactions are common, usually presenting as photosensitivity or less frequently as a blue/grey pigmentation on light-exposed sites. Leucocytoclastic vasculitis following treatment with amiodarone has been reported rarely. We describe a further case and briefly review the unwanted cutaneous manifestations of amiodarone therapy.

Abstract: Two patients with amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis were treated successfully with potassium perchlorate and carbimazole while treatment with amiodarone was continued. These antithyroid drugs were stopped after the patients had became clinically and biochemically euthyroid. During follow up, when treatment with amiodarone continued, thyrotoxicosis did not recur. Amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis seems to be a transient condition that can be treated successfully with a short course of antithyroid drugs without stopping amiodarone treatment.

Abstract: We studied long-term variability of QT-dispersion in three patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (Maron III) and ventricular fibrillation. Late potentials were absent on signal-averaged electrocardiogram. ST-segment depression was recorded in all three patients at Holter monitoring, and in two during exercise stress testing, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia was present in only one patient. The maximal correct QT-interval and corrected QT-dispersion (QTcd) were measured retrospectively, both off-drug and under treatment with amiodarone and beta-blocker (two patients), or sotalol alone (one patient). Ten age- and sex-matched normal subjects, and 13 hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients without ventricular arrhythmias formed the control groups. QTcd-values in the control groups never exceeded 80 ms and mean values of 30.1 +/- 10.1 ms and 44.1 +/- 7.9 ms respectively, were found. During long-term follow-up, QTcd increased progressively in two of the three patients with ventricular fibrillation, and at the time of the event all showed a value > 100 ms. Sotalol, but not the amiodarone reduced QTcd. QTcd seems to be a powerful predictor of ventricular electrical instability in the absence of other specific markers, and a promising guide for effective pharmacological therapy.

Abstract: We report the anaesthetic management of a Caesarean section in a woman treated with high dose amiodarone for fetal supraventricular tachycardia. Most of the interactions between anaesthesia and amiodarone therapy previously reported were observed during general anaesthesia. We therefore chose epidural anaesthesia using incremental doses of lignocaine 2% with adrenaline and fentanyl. This technique appeared to be safe, but since severe refractory vasodilation with hypotension may occur, potent vasopressor agents should be immediately available.

Abstract: A 74 year old man had recurrent ventricular tachycardia, which was well controlled with amiodarone, and complete heart block for which a VVI permanent pacing system had previously been implanted. After an elective increase in the programmed pacemaker rate from 70 to 82 beats/min, there was recurrence of frequent episodes of ventricular tachycardia. Each episode of tachycardia was initiated by a fusion beat consisting of a ventricular extrasystole and a paced beat. When the pacemaker rate was reprogrammed to 70 beats/min the episodes of tachycardia ceased abruptly. It is proposed that the fusion of a ventricular extrasystole with a pacemaker beat may have induced ventricular tachycardia, even though neither of these beats occurring separately was sufficient to cause this.

Abstract: In patients with malignant ventricular arrhythmias, antiarrhythmic therapy is known to carry a substantial risk of proarrhythmia. This risk is usually considered to be low when supraventricular arrhythmias or benign ventricular arrhythmias are considered. We were able to collect data on four patients without a history of life-threatening arrhythmias, in whom antiarrhythmic therapy was used and resulted in documented ventricular fibrillation or torsade de pointes. In Cases No. 1 and 2, atrial fibrillation was treated with either quinidine or quinidine and sotalol in combination. In both patients Holter monitoring, 4-12 h after conversion to sinus rhythm, documented the spontaneous occurrence of torsade de pointes degenerating into ventricular fibrillation and requiring DC shock for termination. In Case No. 3, atrial fibrillation was treated with sotalol and amiodarone for 2 months when incessant episodes of torsade de pointes were documented. In Case No. 4, frequent but unsustained ventricular arrhythmias were treated with amiodarone in a patient suffering dilative cardiomyopathy. After 6 days of treatment at a heart rate of 54 beats/min, a marked QT increase was associated with the occurrence of repetitive episodes of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia degenerating into ventricular fibrillation. None of the patients presented significant electrolyte abnormalities in the laboratory. A pathologic increase of the QTc-time was documented in Cases No. 1, 3, and 4. In all patients antiarrhythmic therapy was withdrawn after the proarrhythmic event and the patient became free of malignant tachyarrhythmias. Antiarrhythmic therapy also carries a considerable risk of proarrhythmia when "benign" cardiac arrhythmias are treated. The risk seems to be lower than in patients with malignant arrhythmias, however it includes the occurrence of lethal tachyarrhythmias. Special attention should be paid to the selection of antiarrhythmic agents when used in combination.

Abstract: A 62-year-old male patient, suffering from a hypertensive cardiopathy, an arteriopathy of the lower extremities and a type II insulin independent diabetes had a prothrombin time ratio R of 2.15 (therapeutic range: 2.1-1.45) during a daily treatment of 4-6 mg acenocoumarin. On admission to the psychiatric hospital for depression, a mianserin treatment was commenced, leading to a sharp modification in the PT ratio R, in effect that the acenocoumarin treatment had to be increased to keep R within the therapeutic range. The possible mechanism of this interaction between mianserin and acenocoumarin is discussed, taking into account the possible role of the comedicated amiodarone.

Abstract: Ventricular fibrillation is a complication in patients hospitalized for acute myocardial infarction. We report the case of an unusually high number of episodes of ventricular fibrillation (66 episodes) that occurred within a period of 4 h in a patient with recent anterior myocardial infarction. In patients with acute or recent myocardial infarction and recurrent episodes of ventricular fibrillation, intravenous lidocaine is the antiarrhythmic medication of choice. In our patient, recurrences of ventricular fibrillation were not prevented either by lidocaine, or amiodarone. The rate of recurrence of ventricular fibrillation, however, decreased dramatically, twice, in the minutes following two separate boluses of propafenone, and the arrhythmia did not recur when continuous infusion of propafenone was started. We cannot exclude that were the combined antiarrhythmic effects of lidocaine, amiodarone and propafenone that led to the final control of the arrhythmia.

Abstract: A case of acute reversible pulmonary damage from amiodarone is described. Pulmonary infiltrates had a basal predominance. The histopathologic picture was that of acute alveolitis. Orthodeoxia was evident on blood gas analysis; the PaO2 was 73 mm Hg on recumbency, and the PaO2 was 57 mm Hg in the upright position. Partial arterial resaturation was evident on exercise (PaO2, 64 mm Hg).

Abstract: The manifestations of amiodarone pulmonary toxicity (APT) are generally nonspecific, and a diagnosis requires appropriate clinical history, laboratory testing consistent with toxicity, and exclusion of other disease entities. To our knowledge, hemoptysis associated with APT has not been described before; the following report describes such a case. We suggest that APT should be considered among the differential diagnosis of hemoptysis in a patient receiving amiodarone.

Abstract: Electrophysiological studies with simultaneous echocardiographic control and invasive measurement of intravascular pressures were carried out in a 13-year-old boy with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy who was hospitalized after an episode of aborted sudden death. Ventricular stimulation did not induce ventricular tachycardia, but atrial stimulation induced atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. Atrial stimulation (S1) at 200 beats.min-1 (10-15 s) also induced significant repolarization abnormalities in the 5-10 post-stimulation beats. Akinesia of the ventricular septum and posterior wall without opening of the mitral valve was documented by echocardiography. A complete anterior systolic motion, not observed under basal conditions, was detected in the first post-stimulation beat. Atrial stimulation at rates over 120 beats.min-1 caused a drop in systolic blood pressure, a rise in pulmonary artery pressure, and a decrease in cardiac output. Despite therapy with propranolol and amiodarone, the patient died suddenly.

Abstract: To describe a potential drug interaction between amiodarone and clonazepam.
A 78-year-old man with a history of congestive heart failure and coronary artery disease began taking amiodarone to suppress sustained ventricular tachycardia. Following the development of restless leg syndrome, therapy with clonazepam 0.5 mg qhs was initiated. Subsequently, the patient demonstrated signs and symptoms of benzodiazepine toxicity, which cleared following the discontinuation of clonazepam.
Amiodarone is a Class III antiarrhythmic with an adverse-effect profile involving many different organ systems. It also has been shown to inhibit the metabolism of drugs cleared by oxidative microsomal enzymes. Clonazepam undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism, primarily by reduction and acetylation, and is therefore susceptible to altered disposition during concomitant administration of agents that inhibit hepatic microsomal enzymes. Hypothyroidism, occurring in up to 11 percent of patients treated with amiodarone, can also alter drug metabolism and sensitize the central nervous system, thus increasing the potential for toxicity. It is likely that a combination of these factors was responsible for the symptoms described in this patient.
The complex pharmacologic profile of amiodarone and its effects on multiple organ systems necessitates close patient monitoring during concurrent administration of medications such as clonazepam, which are cleared by oxidative metabolism.

Abstract: To report a new case and review the literature of amiodarone-related epididymitis to improve knowledge of the clinical characteristics of this reaction.
Cohort study.
Tertiary out-patient arrhythmia clinic.
Males currently treated for arrhythmias with amiodarone for at least two months. Thirty-two patients were identified and all were contacted.
Swelling and or/pain in the scrotum with confirmation of noninfectious epididymitis by a urologist.
Bibliography (Medline and Embase) and databases (Manufacturer, Health Protection Branch, World Health Organisation).
Four articles with case reports. Databases searched for these key words: amiodarone and epididymitis.
A new case is reported. Twelve cases have been presented individually and six more described collectively. Times to onset range from four to 71 months, daily doses range from 200 to 800 mg. The reaction is self-limited, with or without amiodarone reduction, and does not require antimicrobial drugs, but a noninvasive urological examination may be warranted.
Awareness by cardiologists will prevent unnecessary invasive urological investigations or antibiotic therapy.

Abstract: Primary myocardial diseases in the pediatric age group encompass a variety of metabolic, infectious, congenital, and acquired disorders, one of which is "histiocytoid cardiomyopathy." We describe clinical and pathologic features in two infants. Autopsy findings in the first case were consistent with sudden cardiac death. The second infant has survived for 2 years on antiarrhythmic therapy with amiodarone. Microscopically, cells with vacuolated to granular cytoplasm were grouped in fascicles, imparting a pseudonodular appearance, but following a distribution reminiscent of conduction fibers. Ultrastructurally, the cells lack a T-tubule system, possess scattered lipid droplets and desmosomes rather than side-to-side junctions, and contain leptomeric fibrils that predominantly marginate to the cell periphery without sarcomeres. Immunostaining of paraffin-embedded tissue reveals perimembranous immunoreactivity for muscle-specific actin, but not for the histiocytic markers CD68 (KP1) and lysozyme. Immunohistochemistry may be a practical alternative when tissue is not saved for electron microscopy. The clinical and pathologic features of this disorder in light of the current literature suggest that it may be hamartoma, possibly of conduction system origin.

Abstract: The present report illustrates the clinical and biochemical outcome in two amiodarone iodine-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIIT) patients submitted to plasmapheresis. Amiodarone was discontinued, and treatment with MMI (40 mg/day) was started. In addition, patients were submitted to two sessions of plasma-exchange, with a one-day interval between the two session. In both patients serum total T3 (TT3) and free T3 (FT3) concentrations decreased promptly but in contrast to the serum TT3, FT3 levels remained steadily above the normal range. A similar behaviour was observed for total T4 and free T4 plasma concentrations. Interestingly, a clearcut clinical amelioration was observed in both patients even before a reduction of circulating free thyroid hormone concentrations could be documented. In conclusion, our experience indicates that plasmapheresis may be useful in order to obtain a rapid amelioration of severe clinical picture of thyrotoxicosis, but cannot be considered as a definite therapy in AIIT. It should be considered that plasmapheresis is not devoid of risks and is also a very expensive procedure.

Abstract: We describe the concurrent administration of amiodarone using three different routes in order to provide: 1) rapid and adequate fetal loading without giving unduly high doses to the mother, and 2) a maintenance dose to the fetus without risking repeated invasive procedures.
Rapid atrial flutter was seen on ultrasound in a fetus with severe hydrops at 27 weeks' gestation. Following failed transplacental therapy with sotalol and flecainide, amiodarone was administered to the fetus via the intravenous, intraperitoneal, and transplacental routes. Conversion to sinus rhythm and resolution of hydrops followed this treatment.
Combined triple-route administration of amiodarone to the fetus can be effective in treating supraventricular tachycardia and may have a role in the management of life-threatening fetal arrhythmias refractory to transplacental therapy.

Abstract: Cases of hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism associated with amiodarone therapy are described, and the mechanisms, clinical appearance, and management of amiodarone-induced thyroid dysfunction are discussed. A 72-year-old man with a history of recurrent ventricular tachycardia unresponsive to conventional antiarrhythmic drugs was started on amiodarone therapy. Initially he responded well, but after three months he began to have fatigue, dry skin, and intolerance of cold. His serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentration had risen from 4.4 microU/mL before amiodarone therapy began to 20 microU/mL, consistent with hypothyroidism. He was started on sodium levothyroxine for thyroid hormone replacement; the dosage was adjusted in accordance with subsequent TSH measurements. His hospital course was complicated by congestive heart failure. The second patient was a 43-year-old man with a history of atrial fibrillation who developed hyperthyroidism when placed on amiodarone therapy. He had persistent sweating, intolerance of heat, restlessness, and tachycardia. Thyroid function tests confirmed the presence of hyperthyroidism. The patient was treated with propylthiouracil and propranolol, and amiodarone was discontinued. He remained unresponsive to the propylthiouracil, which was discontinued, and was scheduled for radioactive iodine treatment. The mechanism of amiodarone-induced thyroid dysfunction may involve the large iodine content of the drug. Amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism may range in severity from mild symptoms to severe myxedema; the skin, hair, and nails are particularly affected. Persons with clinical hyperthyroidism secondary to amiodarone treatment show the signs and symptoms of a hypermetabolic state resulting from thyroid hormone excess. Amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism is treated with levothyroxine and hyperthyroidism with antithyroid drugs. Amiodarone can cause thyroid dysfunction, which can have serious consequences.

Abstract: A 68-year-old diabetic and hypertensive woman presented with chronic autonomic diarrhoea, syncope and palpitations which were associated with QT prolongation and recurrent episodes of torsade de pointes. She was on glibenclamide, indapamide and probucol (for type V hyperlipidaemia). Despite intravenous infusions of potassium, lignocaine and amiodarone, the unstable rhythm persisted. However, intravenous magnesium sulphate with small doses of intravenous propranolol terminated the torsade de pointes. She was stabilised but following discharge she relapsed, and upon re-admission, succumbed to intractable ventricular fibrillation. Early recognition and aggressive treatment of this condition is emphasised. Multiple aggravating factors ie autonomic diarrhoea resulting in severe potassium and magnesium depletion, kaliuretic effect of indapamide, probable QT prolongation associated with diabetic autonomic neuropathy and probucol; probable underlying coronary artery disease and heightened emotional and sympathetic discharge could have contributed to this very unstable ventricular arrhythmia and sudden death.

Abstract: Amiodarone causes accumulation of phospholipids in lung alveolar cells, and this phospholipidosis invariably is present when amiodarone pulmonary toxicity is recognized. This effect has usually been demonstrated in patients following several months of therapy. The authors report the occurrence of pulmonary phospholipidosis, diagnosed by bronchoalveolar lavage, six days after commencing intravenous amiodarone therapy.

Abstract: To report a possible interaction between cyclosporine (CsA) and amiodarone in a kidney transplant recipient.
A 66-year-old kidney transplant recipient with a history significant for hypertension, moderate mitral valve insufficiency, and decreased left ventricular function developed ventricular tachycardia posttransplant and was eventually treated with amiodarone. Maintenance immunosuppression included prednisone, azathioprine, and CsA. CsA concentrations before amiodarone initiation were stable (range 100-150 ng/mL). After amiodarone initiation, the CsA concentration increased more than twofold. Following CsA dosage reduction, concentrations returned to the desired range. The patient did not experience any toxicity with the increased concentration of CsA.
The possible mechanisms of an interaction between CsA and amiodarone are reviewed. Reports of this interaction in heart transplant recipients are also reviewed. Changes in protein binding, changes in metabolism, or both may explain the interaction. Both CsA and amiodarone are protein bound and metabolized by the cytochrome P-450 enzyme system.
It is likely that there is an interaction between CsA and amiodarone. The exact mechanism of this interaction has not been fully determined. When CsA is administered concurrently with amiodarone, CsA concentrations should be monitored closely and the CsA dosage should be adjusted as necessary.

Abstract: Recurrent severe allograft rejection is an uncommon but difficult management problem in heart transplantation. Total lymphoid irradiation is now a recognized treatment modality when conventional therapy has failed. We describe an unusual complication of total lymphoid irradiation in a patient who had been treated with amiodarone for malignant arrhythmias before transplantation.

Abstract: Amiodarone is an iodine-rich drug used in the treatment of resistant cardiac arrhythmias. Amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) is well recognized and is generally believed to be due to the excess iodine released from the metabolism of the drug, although amiodarone-associated thyroiditis has occasionally been observed. We report the clinical, laboratory, and therapeutic course of nine patients with AIT. The thyrotoxic phase was often followed by mild hypothyroidism during and after antithyroid drug or corticosteroid therapy. The thyroid was tender to palpation in two patients and a fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the thyroid revealed changes consistent with thyroiditis in three patients who underwent biopsy. These findings strongly suggest that the etiology of AIT, at least in some patients, is due, in part, to drug-induced inflammatory changes in the thyroid, as has been reported to occur in lung, bone marrow, and testes. Thus, the AIT may be due to excess iodine, drug-induced thyroiditis, or a combination of the two. The favorable response of AIT to corticosteroids in occasional patients previously reported also suggests that acute thyroiditis was probably present.

Abstract: T wave alternans is an intriguing phenomenon widely observed in some experimental conditions, but rare in clinics. The authors describe a case of T wave alternans associated with amiodarone treatment. This electrocardiographic finding spontaneously reverted and was not associated with ventricular arrhythmias or hemodynamic depression. Mechanisms that may be responsible for alternation of the T wave are discussed.

Abstract: A 72 year old white man developed acute hepatic impairment and renal failure within 24 hours of starting intravenous amiodarone for paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia. After normal initial investigations, there was a noticeable rise in serum transaminases as well as an increase in clotting times, a decrease in renal function and a thrombocytopenia. These changes returned to normal within seven days of withdrawal of the drug without specific treatment, and the patient was later treated with oral amiodarone without any further evidence of hepatotoxicity. Intravenous amiodarone has been implicated in acute hepatic disease on four previous occasions, but it is suggested that polysorbate 80, an organic surfactant added to the intravenous infusion, is a more likely cause of this complication. Similar reactions have been described with polysorbate 80 in association with the 'E-ferol' syndrome in infants. The occurrence of acute hepatic impairment with intravenous amiodarone does not necessarily preclude the use of this drug by mouth.

Abstract: We report a case of lidocaine toxicity with seizures that appears to represent a drug interaction with amiodarone. A toxic lidocaine level and reduced lidocaine clearance were documented 65 h after amiodarone was added to the treatment regimen. This is the first report of increased levels and serious clinical toxicity of lidocaine due to amiodarone. The mechanism appears to be altered hepatic metabolism of lidocaine caused by amiodarone.

Abstract: A case of a parathyroid adenoma is presented in which the conventional Tl-201 minus Tc-99m subtraction technique failed to localize the adenoma because of prior iodide administration and a low Tl-201 uptake. Ultrasonography and CT could not provide useful data either. However, a Tc-99m methoxylisobutylisonitrile (MIBI) scintigram clearly delineated the adenoma and the thyroid tissue.

Abstract: The interaction between amiodarone and the defibrillation threshold (DFT) is still controversial. We present a case with dilated cardiomyopathy and recurrent sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia who received an automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator (AICD) while under long-term amiodarone treatment. AICD implantation was performed without thoracotomy. The transvenous lead was inserted via a left subclavian vein puncture and the patch was placed on the lateral chest wall, submuscularly. At the time of implantation a 35J shock was not successful in converting ventricular fibrillation to sinus rhythm, but a 40J rescue shock was successful. After discontinuation of amiodarone, DFT measurements were repeated. Sixteen days later DFT was still higher than 34J, but 71 days later it decreased to 20J.

Abstract: The antiarrhythmic drug, amiodarone, induces thyroid dysfunction, which is potentially dangerous in cardiac patients. After discontinuation of the drug it takes several months before euthyroidism is restored. The potent antithyroid drug, potassium perchlorate (KClO4), is used successfully to treat amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis, but it is less well known as potential treatment in amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism. In this case report we describe the successful use of two courses of KClO4 treatment in a cardiac patient with severe amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism. The mechanisms responsible for the amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism and rationale for the use of KClO4 in this condition are discussed.

Abstract: The presence of fine epithelial deposits in a whorled pattern (cornea verticillata) as a consequence of treatment with amiodarone is well documented. We present a case of amiodarone keratopathy in a grafted cornea which is atypical in that the orientation of the pattern is rotated through nearly 90 degrees to that normally observed. This observation runs counter to the hypothesis that cornea verticillata is a manifestation of the line of lid closure. We speculate on the mechanism directing the migrational pathways of epithelial cells.

Abstract: In a patient chronically treated with amiodarone, subclinical iodine-induced hypothyroidism occurred as a result of excess iodine released from the amiodarone molecule. The patient was maintained on amiodarone and developed thyrotoxicosis as a result of a destructive process into the thyroid follicles. Amiodarone was withdrawn and methylprednisolone and methimazole treatment was started with resolution of the thyrotoxic phase. Months later, off therapy, the patient developed subclinical hypothyroidism. This is the first description of hypo- and hyperthyroidism in the same patient caused by amiodarone therapy. This unusual observation suggests that patients treated with amiodarone are at risk to develop hyperthyroidism even if they show laboratory findings consistent with hypothyroidism.

Abstract: Amiodarone, a commonly used antiarrhythmic agent, has numerous adverse effects. The purpose of this case report is to highlight its hepatotoxicity, an unusual complication of long term amiodarone therapy. Our patient is a 76-year-old man with underlying ischaemic heart disease and recurrent ventricular tachycardia. Eleven months after commencing amiodarone, he developed asymptomatic raised aminotransferases which resolved following drug withdrawal. Amiodarone was then reintroduced and four years later, the patient developed hepatomegaly, worsening liver biochemistry and histopathological changes consistent with early cirrhosis. His symptoms improved following discontinuation of amiodarone. However, hepatomegaly and a low serum albumin still persist four years later.

Abstract: A 32-year-old black man presented with a history of palpitations since childhood and two syncopal episodes. He was found to have incessant ventricular tachycardia, impaired left ventricular contraction (ejection fraction 9%), and nonobstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Procainamide abolished the arrhythmia and the ejection fraction rose to 22% in sinus rhythm. Later treatment was switched to amiodarone, which suppressed the ventricular tachycardia but necessitated pacemaker implantation. He has remained well during the subsequent 2 years. Left ventricular ejection fraction has increased to 47% measured in paced rhythm. The improvement in left ventricular function has been attributed to suppression of the incessant ventricular tachycardia.

Abstract: Amiodarone treatment in pregnancy might be difficult to handle because of the long half-life of the drug (14-28 days up to 2 months) and because it reduces maternal and neonatal thyroid activity. Although short-term use in pregnancy has been described in cases of fetal supraventricular tachycardia, there are few reports on the chronic use of the drug. In this paper we describe our experience with amiodarone treatment in two pregnant sisters with familial dilatative cardiomyopathy and ventricular malignant extrasystole. Prolonged administration of amiodarone (400-200 mg/die) since the beginning of pregnancy did not have any adverse effects; maternal and neonatal thyroid function was normal, as was the neurological and motor development of the neonates.

Abstract: Palpitations are a symptom often reported by patients with apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), yet the arrhythmias associated with this type of HCM have not been studied adequately. Herein, a case of persistently recurrent atrial flutter in a 63-year-old Greek man with apical HCM is presented. Synchronized direct-current shocks were used twice during his hospitalization in order to convert atrial flutter to sinus rhythm. No definite precipitating factor for the induction of atrial flutter was identified.

Abstract: We report the case of a heart transplant patient whose cyclosporine clearance decreased by more than 50% after the institution of amiodarone therapy. This interaction necessitated a significant dosage reduction to maintain cyclosporine concentrations within the therapeutic range. To investigate the mechanism of the interaction, a cyclosporine-lipoprotein-binding determination was performed. The results suggest that drug displacement from competitive lipoprotein-binding sites is not responsible for the alterations in cyclosporine pharmacokinetics. Clearance data suggests, however, that the primary mechanism for the interaction is the inhibition cyclosporine metabolism by the cytochrome P-450 system. This report emphasizes the importance of reevaluating therapeutic drug regimens when new agents are added to prevent complications caused by drug interactions. If amiodarone and cyclosporine must be used concomitantly, cyclosporine levels must be monitored frequently, in anticipation of this interaction.

Abstract: A 55-year-old patient with inferior wall infarction was treated effectively for ventricular tachycardia with high-dose oral amiodarone loading regimen (5 g within 16 hours). Serial pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated a rapid temporary increase in amiodarone plasma concentration to a maximum of 3.40 micrograms/ml 17 hours after initiation of therapy followed by a return to normal plasma concentration within 8 hours. During fast drug evasion the patient developed acute low-output syndrome with syncope successfully controlled with intravenous catecholamine administration. Our findings suggest that the cardiovascular collapse was caused by the non-competitive adrenoceptor antagonism of amiodarone resulting in secondary autonomic insufficiency.

Abstract: A 69 year old woman was treated with sotalol (320 mg daily) for intermittent atrial fibrillation. Sotalol was initially well tolerated and reversion to sinus rhythm with sinus bradycardia occurred 4 weeks after initiation of therapy. Shortly thereafter, the patient developed recurrent syncope due to torsade de pointes. This was treated successfully with intravenous magnesium infusion and withdrawal of sotalol. Subsequently, the atrial fibrillation was adequately managed using amiodarone, with no recurrence of torsade de pointes. Development of bradycardia associated with reversion to sinus rhythm represents a potential cause of 'late' pro-arrhythmic effects of sotalol.

Abstract: A 62-year-old lady with hypertension and diabetes developed bilateral, sequential ischemic optic neuropathy, progressive in the right eye. Because of a reported association between amiodarone and optic neuropathy with disc edema, the patient discontinued taking this medication; however, her visual loss continued. The differential diagnoses of bilateral ischemic optic neuropathy--including infiltrative optic neuropathy and temporal arteritis--were exhaustively investigated in this patient.

Abstract: Five cases are studied in which amiodarone (AM) was given during pregnancy, in two of them also during the breast feeding period, to estimate the risks for adverse effects. We measured the concentrations of AM and its major metabolite desethylamiodarone (DEA) in maternal plasma, cord plasma, infant plasma, placental tissue and breast milk and the thyroid hormones were measured in maternal and neonatal serum. Also, the neonates were examined for AM-associated adverse effects over a period varying from 8 months up to 5 years. We observed a limited maternal-fetal transfer of AM and DEA, while the concentration of DEA in placental tissue is relatively high. Considerable amounts of AM and DEA were present in breast milk. One infant appeared to be hypothyroid, detected by the neonatal thyroid screening. He was treated with triiodothyronine for weeks, until it was clear that the thyroid dysfunction was resolved. The other infants had normal screening results. No effect of the AM medication was observed on growth, liver function or cornea and skin.
although pregnancy and lactation are no absolute contraindications for use of AM, special precautions are necessary. It is unavoidable that in some cases the pregnant mother, and especially her infant, becomes hypothyroid. AM has to be administered in the lowest possible dose, and the maternal and neonatal thyroid function must be controlled as long as the exposure to AM lasts.

Abstract: A patient receiving amiodarone for longstanding ventricular dysrhythmias presented with idiopathic chylothorax. During drainage of chylothorax for pleurodesis, serial plasma amiodarone concentrations declined while pleural fluid concentrations remained stable. Chylous transport of amiodarone and other lipid-bound drugs should be recognized to avert complications during chylothorax drainage.

Abstract: Amiodarone is very useful treatment for refractory arrhythmias. However, it has a wide profile of adverse effects involving a number of organ systems. Pulmonary toxicity is the most serious of these side effects and often limits its clinical use. Three patients with unusual forms of amiodarone pulmonary toxicity are described. One had extensive unilateral alveolar disease, another pleural effusion, and in a third the pulmonary infiltrate improved with oral corticosteroids despite continuation of amiodarone therapy. Extensive unilateral alveolar disease and resolution of the pulmonary toxicity with corticosteroids despite continuing with amiodarone have not been previously reported. Pleural effusion has been noted only rarely. With the increasing use of amiodarone, pulmonary toxicity is likely to occur more frequently and it is important to be aware of its less common manifestations.

Abstract: We report four cases of life-threatening amiodarone iodine-induced thyrotoxicosis. Two patients died of a thyroid storm, and the other two patients developed severe thyrocardiac disease unresponsive to 6 months intensive antithyroid and steroid therapy. One of these latter patients died 1 month after thyroidectomy. Euthyroidism was achieved in the last patient by treatment with potassium perchlorate. The course could not be explained by the prior thyroid or cardiac status in any of the four cases.

Abstract: A case of amiodarone pulmonary toxicity (APT) is described following a low dosage of amiodarone (200 mg/day) with serious respiratory insufficiency in a patient after right pneumonectomy. The patient was successfully treated by discontinuation of amiodarone, mechanical ventilation and prednisolone (40 mg/day). A literature study indicates that APT is a dose related toxicity. In our opinion a higher pulmonary drug concentration of amiodarone could exist from a change in pharmacokinetics because of a low fat storage in a thin patient and compensatory growth of the remaining lung which occurs after pneumonectomy. Given these findings we suggest that if amiodarone is indicated in such patients both loading and maintenance doses should be adapted.

Abstract: Pulmonary toxicity is an important adverse effect of amiodarone therapy that usually manifests as an acute or chronic diffuse lung disease; in rare cases localized lesions have also been described. We observed a solitary mass localized in the left lung base and involving the adjacent pleura in a 69-year-old man who had been treated for 1 year with amiodarone (cumulative dose 52 g). Cytological and histological examination showed that the lesion consisted of fibrotic tissue and a massive macrophagic infiltration. Following suspension of amiodarone and surgical excision, there was a complete recovery and the mass did not relapse. We confirm that respiratory complaints can occur in patients treated by long-term amiodarone therapy and that lung involvement can manifest with a solitary localized (fibrotic) lesion.

Abstract: A 13-year-old girl presented with incessant ventricular tachycardia complicating acute Coxsackie B3 myocarditis. Electrophysiologic assessment revealed that the tachycardia could not be terminated, overdrive suppressed or accelerated by programmed electrical stimulation, but was transiently slowed by intravenous adenosine triphosphate and had marked spontaneous and sympathoautonomic-mediated fluctuation in the tachycardia cycle length. These features were atypical of reentry and triggered automaticity and suggested that abnormal automaticity was the likely tachycardia mechanism. Intravenous amiodarone slowed the ventricular tachycardia, but the patient eventually succumbed from rapidly progressive left ventricular failure. Postmortem pathohistologic examination confirmed the diagnosis of acute myocarditis.

Abstract: This case describes a 75-year-old man who developed pulmonary fibrosis. The onset of symptoms occurred three months after starting mexiletine. A computerized tomogram obtained eight months after initiating mexiletine documented findings consistent with chronic pulmonary fibrosis. The patient died from intractable respiratory difficulties 13 months after beginning mexiletine therapy. To date, there have been three cases of pulmonary fibrosis in patients receiving mexiletine spontaneously reported to the manufacturer.

Abstract: A 45-year-old patient with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome suffering from recurrent intractable reciprocating atrioventricular tachycardia (RAVT) is reported. He used amiodarone, sotalol, quinidine, propafenone and flecainide unsuccessfully. An electrophysiological study (EPS) performed with four catheters localized the site of the anomalous pathway in the ostium of the coronary sinus. In this region we could also record a Kent potential. In the ostium of the coronary sinus, radiofrequency energy was repeatedly applied until the conduction over the accessory pathway was abolished both in the anterograde and the retrograde direction. The Kent deflection detectable before ablation, could not be detected after it. During follow-up (1 month) the patient remained asymptomatic and the control EPS showed no evidence of pre-excitation, either anterogradely or retrogradely.

Abstract: Poorly controlled supraventricular arrhythmias in a hypokalaemic 74 year old woman were treated with oral amiodarone. This caused torsades de pointes, and was preceded by marked prolongation of the QT interval. The induction of torsades de pointes by amiodarone is thought to be an idiosyncratic reaction to amiodarone itself which is facilitated by electrolytic abnormalities. The present case, however, indicates the possibility of a pro-arrhythmic effect secondary to an interaction between amiodarone and digoxin.

Abstract: Incessant supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) resistant to pharmacological agents may cause cardiac dysfunction requiring more aggressive therapy. We present the case of a 12-year-old postoperative Mustard patient who developed biventricular heart failure due to an atrial ectopic tachycardia resistant to amiodarone. Using endocavitary direct current fulguration techniques, catheter ablation of the His bundle was successfully performed after unsuccessful attempts at ablation of the ectopic atrial foci. After placement of a permanent transvenous rate responsive ventricular pacemaker, the patient's clinical status and cardiac function improved. Endocavitary fulguration of the His bundle is technically feasible after the Mustard procedure and should be considered for treatment of selective cases of pharmacologically resistant SVT.

Abstract: Torsade de pointes may occur as a complication of amiodarone therapy. We report a patient receiving amiodarone who was resuscitated from cardiovascular collapse and documented ventricular fibrillation. At subsequent electrophysiology study, while the patient was taking amiodarone therapy, monophasic action potentials with early after depolarisations were recorded which were not present when the patient was restudied 6 weeks after discontinuation of amiodarone. Early after-depolarisations may be important in the genesis of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia complicating amiodarone therapy.

Abstract: A 45-year-old man had severe blue-gray cutaneous discoloration during amiodarone therapy for atrial fibrillation. Therefore, this drug regimen was discontinued, and long-term anticoagulation and digoxin therapy were used. The patient was advised to avoid exposure of his skin to sunlight, and a bleaching agent was prescribed. After 18 months of follow-up, the blue-gray hyperpigmentation had diminished. Although photosensitivity reactions from amiodarone occur in more than 50% of patients, blue-gray cutaneous discoloration occurs in less than 10% of patients on prolonged therapy with amiodarone. The presence of high concentrations of iodine, detected by electron probe analysis, suggests that the cutaneous deposits are amiodarone itself or a metabolite. The slow rate of elimination of amiodarone and a high uptake by fat-associated tissues may explain the delayed disappearance of cutaneous photosensitivity and late resolution of the blue-gray discoloration. Our current case supports the reversibility of these adverse effects on long-term follow-up.

Abstract: A 55-year-old woman who had been receiving treatment with amiodarone for recurrent supraventricular tachyarrhythmias became thyrotoxic after 30 months of treatment. The thyroid gland was not enlarged or tender. Amiodarone was discontinued, and thyrotoxicosis gradually abated. A thyroid scan performed at that time revealed a gland of normal size and texture. Six months later, amiodarone treatment was reinstated due to life-threatening tachyarrhythmia; however, the patient remained euthyroid. Three years later, multinodular goiter began to develop, and 5 years after that, the patient became hypothyroid. Tests for thyroid autoantibodies, as well as inhibitory and stimulatory antibodies, were negative, and fine needle aspiration biopsy revealed an adenomatous goiter. Treatment with amiodarone was continued; however, therapy with L-thyroxin was initiated, followed by a complete regression of the goiter. The patient has since required a maintenance dose of L-thyroxin. The possible mechanisms by which iodine-containing drugs induce thyroid disfunction are reviewed, suggesting this case was caused by an alteration in the sensitivity of the intrinsic autoregulation of the thyroid gland to iodine.

Abstract: Beta-blockers and calcium antagonists have been advocated for thyrotoxicosis induced tachyarrhythmias. Amiodarone is generally considered as contraindicated because of its high iodine content. Since amiodarone combined with propylthiouracil induced a greater fall in serum thyroid hormone concentrations than propylthiouracil alone, we treated 2 hyperthyroid patients with supraventricular arrhythmias by radioiodine (day 0) followed after 24 h by amiodarone and propylthiouracil. Serum T3 was normalized on day 2 (patient 1) and 3 (patient 2). Effective t1/2 of intrathyroidal 131I were 6.6 and 4.3 days (versus 5.9 days for 131I given alone). In patient 1, atrial fibrillation, reverted to sinus rhythm after verapamil and digoxin, and did not recur. In patient 2, conversion of atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm occurred on day 11; from day 0 to day 11, ventricular rate decreased and was significantly correlated to T3 (r = 0.82; p < 0.05). In conclusion, amiodarone may be beneficial in thyrotoxicosis associated tachyarrhythmias, given with propylthiouracil 24 h after radioiodine, it did not decrease thyroid irradiation and rapidly decreased serum T3.

Abstract: A patient with refractory and incessant ectopic atrial tachycardia (IEAT) is reported in whom it was possible to document, during ECG (Holter) the occurrence of aborted sudden death by spontaneous ventricular fibrillation (VF). Following the second of two attempts at surgical ablation of the origin of the IEAT, the patient has been asymptomatic without antiarrhythmic drugs and in sustained sinus rhythm for 24 months. Although we cannot exclude the residual action of amiodarone and flecainide (proarrhythmia) or the residual peripartum cardiomyopathy it is probable that the observed VF was a true complication of a cardiomyopathy induced by a chronically increased heart rate (HR). Although unclear, this VF might be considered as a form of adrenergic-dependent long QT syndrome due to early afterdepolarization in the presence of predisposing myocardial conditions.

Abstract: Junctional ectopic tachycardia (JET) in infancy is one of the serious arrhythmias which can be fatal. Typical features of JET include rapid and irregular heart beats with atrioventricular dissociation. Two cases of JET are reported: Case 1 was a 35-week-gestational age newborn who was found to have hydropsy and fetal tachycardia at the 21st week of gestational age. Antiarrhythmic agents including digoxin, propranolol and verapamil were administered to his mother to treat the fetal arrhythmia without success. JET was recognized at birth which was spontaneously converted into a sinus rhythm at 1 month of age. The maternal history revealed that two previous pregnancies ended in hydrops fetalis, and one of these was documented to have fetal tachycardia. Case 2 was a 6-month-old male infant with JET and congestive heart failure. After failure of various antiarrhythmic agents, amiodarone finally slowed down his heart rate and controlled his congestive heart failure.

Abstract: The perioperative management of a 57-yr-old patient receiving chronic amiodarone therapy with a continuous spinal anaesthetic for a low anterior resection of the colon is discussed. The most appropriate anaesthetic technique for patients receiving chronic amiodarone therapy remains controversial, but the avoidance of general anaesthesia may be beneficial because of the risk of postoperative pulmonary failure. In this patient continuous spinal anaesthesia was slowly titrated to the desired level, coincident haemodynamic alterations were easily treated as they developed, and high serum local anaesthetic concentrations which occur with other regional anaesthetic techniques were avoided.

Abstract: Cardiac conduction defects have not been previously described in association with hyponatremia, although in patients with congestive heart failure the frequency of ventricular premature beats was found to correlate to the severity of hyponatremia. We describe three patients with second-degree or complete atrioventricular (AV) block which occurred during or shortly after an episode of severe hyponatremia. The first had thiazide-induced hyponatremia while on amiodarone. In the second, definite etiology for hyponatremia which was associated with longstanding polydipsia could not be established. The third had ischemic heart disease and intermittent conversion of his first-degree to second-degree AV block while hyponatremic after diuretics use. Although it is usually difficult to single out hyponatremia as the cause of conduction defects which usually occur in the presence of cardiac disease, potent medications or other electrolyte abnormalities, we suggest that hyponatremia may play a role in the pathogenesis of conduction defects in the diseased heart.

Abstract: Two fatal cases of amiodarone-induced acute, confluent, necrotic hepatitis are described. The patients, aged 28 and 60, had received a high loading dose of amiodarone. After the first and second day respectively following the administration of amiodarone, the patients developed jaundice, hepatomegaly, high serum transaminases, a prolonged prothrombin time and low cholesterol concentration. They died of hepatic coma and acute renal failure on the fourteenth and fourth day respectively. Needle liver biopsy, performed immediately after death, revealed lesions of acute drug-induced hepatitis with confluent and bridging necrosis. It is proposed that rapid administration of a high loading dose of amiodarone can cause acute confluent necrotic hepatitis. The mode of administration and the dosage of the drug should be re-considered.

Abstract: Amiodarone (A) is a widely-used antiarrhythmic drug. Pulmonary toxicity is the most serious adverse effect with an estimated mortality of 1 to 33 percent. In order to determine an element helpful for diagnosis, we examined four patients with amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity, three patients treated with A, without evidence of pulmonary toxicity but with a main underlying pulmonary disease, and four healthy volunteers. Daily and cumulative doses or duration of treatment were similar in the first two groups. Pulmonary function tests (spirometry, CO-diffusing capacity, arterial blood gases), roentgenographic examinations, pulmonary biopsies or immunoallergologic tests (skin reaction, lymphoblastic transformation test and human basophile degranulation test) did not provide any discriminatory element. In APT+, we observed an increased cellularity of the bronchoalveolar lavage. Neither the differential cell count nor the presence of foamy macrophages were distinguishable between APT+ and APT-. The phospholipid composition of BAL fluid showed a decreased total phospholipid and phospholipid/protein ratio in all patients compared to normal subjects. These changes reflect more the severity of pulmonary disease than the specificity of the causative agent. However, we observed that the unique PL which decreases in APT- and remains normal in APT+ is phosphatidyl-serine + phosphatidylinositol (PS + PI). This has to be confirmed and should be evaluated at different stages of the disease to determine an eventual specific element. We conclude that there are no data currently available to establish the diagnosis of APT except perhaps for the analysis of BAL PL content.

Abstract: A case of exercise-induced cardiac arrest secondary to catecholamine-sensitive right ventricular tachycardia in the absence of apparent structural heart disease is presented. Amiodarone therapy prevented tachycardia induction, symptoms and clinical events despite a return to vigorous exercise.

Abstract: The incidence of major haemorrhagic complications from oral anticoagulants is between 4.4% and 8.2%. Life-threatening haemorrhage is usually either intracranial or gastro-intestinal, but haemorrhage into the upper airways is a distinctly uncommon occurrence. We report the case of an elderly lady who developed an anticoagulant induced haemorrhage into the parapharyngeal area resulting in upper airway obstruction and necessitating an emergency tracheostomy.

Abstract: Sudden death occurred in a patient with congestive cardiomyopathy, sustained ventricular tachycardia refractory to amiodarone, and an automatic internal cardioverter defibrillator. Interrogation of the AICD at the time of death was indicative of malfunction. Postmortem analysis documented component failure involving a voltage regulating transistor resulting in prolonged charge times.

Abstract: Three cases are reported in which resolution of severe esophagitic dyspepsia followed amiodarone therapy for cardiac arrhythmias. This effect has proved long lasting. The mechanism of amiodarone action may be related to its calcium antagonist or nitratelike properties that reduce lower esophageal sphincter tone. An alternate hypothesis calls attention to structural similarities between amiodarone and the histamine antagonist ranitidine, and suggests a previously unrecognized action of amiodarone on histamine receptors.

Abstract: Amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) is generally believed to result from increased hormonal synthesis related to the iodine overload. Thyroid damage has recently been incriminated as a pathophysiological mechanism. We report 3 cases of AIT associated with clinical and/or biochemical features consistent with thyroid damage. This hypothesis was supported by a painful thyroid (case 1), transient high serum Tg (case 2), a transient (case 2) or persistent (case 3) hypothyroid phase and an undetectable technetium thyroid uptake during the hypothyroid period (case 3). These clinical observations support the previous histological data indicating that thyroid follicular disruption might contribute to the pathogenesis of AIT.

Abstract: Amiodarone hydrochloride, an iodine-rich drug used in the treatment of tachyarrhythmias, is responsible for the development of thyrotoxicosis in approximately 10% of patients who reside in areas of moderate iodine deficiency. Treatment of amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis is difficult since the drug has a prolonged half-life, cardiac decompensation due to underlying heart disease occurs often, and discontinuation of amiodarone therapy may not be possible. We report a patient with severe thyrotoxicosis who received amiodarone for 34 months. Prolonged treatment with methimazole, potassium perchlorate, iopanoic acid, and dexamethasone was unsuccessful in controlling the hyperthyroid state. A near-total thyroidectomy resulted in rapid amelioration of thyrotoxicosis. Since surgery results in rapid control of thyrotoxicosis and permits continued therapy with amiodarone, we suggest that near-total thyroidectomy warrants consideration as definitive treatment for resistant amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis.

Abstract: Two patients with Amiodarone-induced interstitial lung disease are described. The pulmonary lung biopsy in one of them, as well as Chest X ray, BAL cellularity and pulmonary function data in both, are in agreement with the reports from the literature, while Ga lung scan was negative in one of the two, and positive in the other one. In both, a total resolution was seen six and four months respectively after discontinuation of Amiodarone therapy. Corticosteroid therapy could be advisable only when no spontaneous resolution occurs after tapering the drug.

Abstract: Presentation of an unusual case of a hyperkalemic periodic paralysis patient who developed a psychotic illness during the course of treatment is made in a conference format. The differential diagnosis of this psychotic episode together with some information regarding hyperkalemic periodic paralysis are discussed. The case illustrates the benefits of close cooperation between medical and psychiatric teams in the management of the psychotic patient with medical illness.

Abstract: It is well known that episodic loss of consciousness and convulsions may have a cardiac rather than a cerebral origin (1). We report a case where these episodes were caused by recurrent ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation secondary to idiopathic long QT syndrome which was effectively treated with amiodarone.

Abstract: This article describes the inadvertent, catheter-induced induction of right bundle branch block resulting not only in transient complete infra-His heart block but also in temporary interruption of the macroreentry circuit of ventricular tachycardia. A patient with preexistent left bundle branch block and spontaneous ventricular tachycardia based upon the bundle branch reentry mechanism underwent electrophysiological testing for the evaluation of sotalol drug efficacy. In search of an optimal His-bundle recording, the manipulation of a 6 Fr quadripolar catheter caused a right bundle branch block, thus advancing the preexistent left bundle branch block to complete heart block. Retrograde ventriculoatrial conduction remained unaffected. The macroreentrant tachycardia with left bundle branch block configuration was no longer inducible. While the patient continued on unchanged sotalol medication (320 mg/d) he required temporary pacing for 16 hours until the block subsided. A subsequent induction attempt demonstrated initiation of the tachycardia. Finally, guided by invasive testing, the patient successfully received amiodarone therapy (300 mg/d). The patient completed an uneventful follow up of 27 months. No progression of conduction delay was observed. This case suggests that the inadvertent induction of right bundle branch block prevents the initiation of ventricular tachycardias relying on bundle branch reentry. Therefore, missed diagnosis or misinterpretation of antiarrhythmic drug efficacy might occur if there is no electrophysiological reevaluation after right bundle branch recovery.

Abstract: Amiodarone hydrochloride, an iodinated benzofuran derivative, is effective for treatment of supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias. Pulmonary fibrosis has been reported after treatment with this drug. We present a patient with amiodarone pulmonary toxicity, who initially responded to corticosteroid therapy, but who developed a clinical relapse two months after withdrawal of the drug.

Abstract: We report a patient who developed an acute painful proximal myopathy associated with the use of amiodarone. The temporal course, the presence of amiodarone related hypothyroidism and neuropathy, as well as the patient's improvement on drug withdrawal were consistent with a drug reaction. Muscle biopsy demonstrated an acute necrotising myopathy. The mechanism for this reaction is unclear.

Abstract: Two patients, treated with acebutolol and amiodarone respectively, developed a disease clinically, radiologically, and pathologically indistinguishable from bronchiolitis obliterans organising pneumonia. In one case recovery followed discontinuation of acebutolol; in the other case cessation of amiodarone had no effect, and corticosteroids were required. In addition to these patients, several cases of bronchiolitis obliterans organising pneumonia have been reported during treatment with gold salts, amiodarone, and miscellaneous other drugs. Taken together, this information supports the view that bronchiolitis obliterans organising pneumonia may be a form of response by the lungs to insult by drugs.

Abstract: Epididymitis is described in a man aged 33 who had been treated with the antiarrhythmic agent, amiodarone. No signs of bacterial infection or anatomical abnormalities were found. Amiodarone as the cause of non-infectious epididymitis has been reported. This additional case stresses the importance of considering an adverse effect of amiodarone treatment as a cause when making a differential diagnosis of epididymitis.

Abstract: Amiodarone induced hypothyroidism (AIH) is assumed to result from a failure of the thyroid to escape from the inhibitory effect of inorganic iodine on its organification as a consequence of uninhibited iodide trapping. This hypothesis was supported by the 24h kinetics of radioiodine uptake in a patient with AIH. 131I uptake reached a maximum after 2h and remained unchanged from 2h to 24h. 131I uptake was in the normal range from 1 1/2h to 7h and clearly subnormal after 9h. The normal early 131I uptake was due to the non inhibition of the iodide-concentrating mechanism and the low 24h radioactivity to the decreased iodide organification. These findings presumably explain the mechanism of AIH.

Abstract: Antiarrhythmic therapy with amiodarone hydrochloride may produce a pattern of vortex corneal epitheliopathy or cornea verticillata. The vortex keratopathy typically occupies the lower third of the cornea, extends superiorly, and is graded according to the degree of extension. Grades I through III describe the amount of vortex change, whereas grade IV describes a generalized granular dusting in addition to the vortex pattern. Grade IV amiodarone-induced keratopathy has been reported from Europe, but no North American series have reported this more advanced epithelial change. We describe a patient who developed grade IV amiodarone-induced keratopathy while wearing soft contact lenses. Of 686 patients treated with amiodarone at the Mayo Clinic and undergoing routine follow-up, this is the first case of grade IV keratopathy we have observed. To our knowledge, this is also the first report of a patient who wore contact lenses and developed this uncommon corneal change while taking amiodarone.

Abstract: Amiodarone is an effective agent in the treatment of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. However, there are numerous side effects associated with this drug, including pulmonary toxicity. This report describes a pulmonary mass that developed in a patient receiving amiodarone and was initially thought to be a lung cancer. Complete resolution occurred after cessation of the drug.

Abstract: We describe a case of amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis following heart valve replacement in a patient with a multinodular goitre. He responded to medical therapy with carbimazole and potassium perchlorate. Subsequent therapy with radio-iodine was followed 30 weeks later by the development of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma. It is possible that amiodarone caused a low uptake of radio-iodine by the thyroid. It is not known whether this possible low dose exposure to ionising radiation played a part in the development of the anaplastic carcinoma.

Abstract: We report a case of reversible, dose-related parkinsonian tremor in a patient taking amiodarone. In previous writings by others, basal ganglia dysfunction associated with amiodarone was dose related and reversibility was inversely related to duration of therapy. Patients receiving amiodarone are at risk for the development of basal ganglia dysfunction which may persist if the drug is not discontinued or the dosage reduced.

Abstract: Cardiac involvement in haemochromatosis includes development of congestive heart failure and/or cardiac arrhythmias. To elucidate the importance of this disorder among patients with severe cardiac bradyarrhythmias necessitating treatment with a permanent pacemaker, such patients were screened for evidence of iron overload. Serum ferritin was determined in 232 men treated with a permanent pacemaker. In six patients (2.6%) the serum ferritin values were twice the upper normal limit. In three of these, causes other than iron overload were found (liver cancer, myeloma and amiodarone treatment), while in three (1.3%) iron overload was suspected. All the latter three had atrioventricular block of second to third degree. In these patients percutaneous liver biopsy was performed. The specimens were examined by light and electron microscopy and the iron content was determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. The results of these investigations showed iron overload in the liver. The prevalence of iron overload (2.0%) among this male pacemaker-treated population with AV block II-III is significantly higher than the rates previously found in urban populations in Sweden. The present data indicate that screening for haemochromatosis is of importance among males with second and third degree atrioventricular-block of unknown etiology.

Abstract: A patient taking an overdose of 3.4 g of amiodarone is described. Consciousness and physical examination remained normal throughout. Continuous electrocardiographic monitoring for 48 hours after admission revealed only a self-limiting episode of ventricular tachycardia, despite high serum levels of the drug (serum desethylamiodarone levels 4.4 mg/l). The pharmacokinetic properties of amiodarone and treatment strategies for the overdose situation are discussed. It is suggested that there may be a role for the use of cholestyramine in the treatment of both acute and chronic amiodarone toxicity.

Abstract: Programmed ventricular stimulation was performed in a patient with sarcoidosis who exhibited an episode of sustained ventricular tachycardia. Sustained rapid ventricular tachyarrhythmias requiring cardioversion for termination were induced by double right ventricular apical extrastimuli during control, and treatment with disopyramide, quinidine, and fluocortolone. In contrast, only four repetitive ventricular complexes were induced during combined therapy with quinidine, mexiletine and amiodarone. While receiving the latter regimen, the patient has been asymptomatic during 28 months of follow-up.

Abstract: Two male patients presented with lung disorders with all the characteristics of amiodarone-related pneumonitis. Bilateral exudative pleural effusions were associated with pneumonitis. High lymphocytosis was present in the pleural fluid with a ratio of T-lymphocyte subsets close to that found in peripheral blood; in the blood T-lymphocyte subset ratio was nearly normal. By contrast, and as is usual in similar cases, lymphocytic alveolitis with T-lymphocyte subset imbalance was found in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. These findings, never published so far to our knowledge, would favor a compartmentalization of the immune response inside the lung.

Abstract: A case of ventricular fibrillation with successful resuscitation is described in a patient with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and a history of syncope. Patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy who are at risk for sudden death can be identified by electrocardiographic monitoring which demonstrates episodes of ventricular tachycardia. Therapy with amiodarone has been shown to abolish ventricular tachycardia and to reduce the incidence of sudden death. Amiodarone therapy eliminated malignant ventricular ectopic activity in this patient during 48 h of ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring, yet the subsequent exercise stress test provoked an episode of ventricular fibrillation.

Abstract: A 50-years-old man with severe heart failure was diagnosed to have congestive cardiomyopathy and low atrial tachycardia at a fixed rate of 103 bpm. Conventional therapy for heart failure exerted a beneficial effect but complete clinical improvement was achieved only by reducing the rate of low atrial tachycardia with amiodarone. This suggests that in this situation tachycardia itself played a main role in the genesis of hemodynamic derangement.

Abstract: Treatment of amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) with thionamide, lithium or radioactive iodine is ineffective. This particular form of hyperthyroidism is long-lasting because of the slow elimination of amiodarone. Therefore, an alternative therapy is necessary, especially for patients who need to continue permanent administration of the drug. We report 2 cases of AIT: in one case, amiodarone was interrupted; in the other case, amiodarone was continued because of recurrent ventricular tachycardia resistant to classical antiarrhythmic drugs. Both patients were successfully treated with propylthiouracil (PTU) and dexamethasone (DXT).

Abstract: The occurrence of torsades de pointe is often associated with the use of drugs. We report three cases of amiodarone-induced torsades de pointe. Although a lot of amiodarone-induced torsades de pointe have been published, a review of all these cases and the underlying risk-factors has never been made.

Abstract: Amiodarone has been reported to cause asymptomatic increases in liver function tests in 15-55% of patients. Clinically apparent, symptomatic hepatic disease occurs less frequently, but patients have been reported to have hepatomegaly, jaundice, cirrhosis, or chronic active hepatitis. Less well recognized is the fact that amiodarone has been attributed to six deaths. We cared for a patient with amiodarone hepatotoxicity, which led us to review the literature associated with this serious condition.

Abstract: Amiodarone has been implicated in the pathogenesis of optic neuropathy in several cases. However, that relationship is unclear, as subjects placed on amiodarone represent a high-risk group for various vasoocclusive accidents. In order to investigate the effect of amiodarone on the optic nerve, we examined histopathologically sections of the retrobulbar optic nerve obtained from an asymptomatic subject taking amiodarone. Lamellar inclusions were selectively found in the large axons. Amiodarone may have a chronic neurotoxic effect on the optic nerve via a drug-induced lipidosis. This neurotoxicity may be related to some of the acute forms of optic neuropathy described in the literature.

Abstract: A standard dual chamber pacemaker with the ability to telemeter intracardiac electrograms and to perform noninvasive electrophysiological studies was implanted in a patient with previously documented complex ventricular arrhythmias treated with amiodarone who later presented with a hypersensitive carotid sinus syndrome and syncope. Subsequently, he developed a supraventricular tachyarrhythmia with an atrial cycle length of 320 ms. Its diagnosis was facilitated by the ability to noninvasively telemeter atrial endocardial electrograms directly from the implanted pacemaker. Its management was aided by utilizing the already implanted bradycardia support pacemaker to stimulate the patient with premature extrastimuli coupled to his intrinsic atrial rhythm (PS1 and S1S2 each 170 ms.) by connecting the pacemaker to an electrophysiological stimulator via the pacemaker programmer. This particular pacemaker was not chosen because of this capability at the time of its original implantation. However, this capability facilitated the patient's evaluation and subsequent management.

Abstract: A 66-year-old white man with amiodarone pneumonitis is presented. The diagnosis was made with the aid of Ga-67 imaging, which is a sensitive method of detecting amiodarone pulmonary toxicity in patients with symptomatic pulmonary infiltrates on chest radiographs. Ga-67 imaging is especially useful in distinguishing amiodarone pneumonitis from congestive heart failure.

Abstract: A 16-yr-old boy who was receiving amiodarone for ventricular arrhythmias developed a Reye's syndrome-like illness several days after an upper respiratory infection. Liver biopsy revealed microvesicular fat and spotty hepatocellular necrosis, typical of Reye's syndrome. Recovery was complete. This case report suggests that medications other than aspirin may predispose to Reye's syndrome, and that children receiving amiodarone should receive prophylaxis against influenza B and chicken pox.

Abstract: A case of the use of amiodarone in pregnancy is reported and the literature on this subject reviewed. The data available to date show: there is no risk of teratogenic effects, the QT interval is prolonged during infancy (no associated arrhythmias noted), infant bradycardia occurs and should be monitored and thyroid function can be affected and should be monitored at birth. If fetal electrocardiographic monitoring is performed before and during labour and after birth, and thyroid function is assessed, then, to date, there does not appear to be any significant contraindication to the use of amiodarone during pregnancy. In view of the potential side effects, however, the use of amiodarone should be restricted to arrhythmias which are life-threatening or not controlled by conventional therapy.

Abstract: We describe a patient in whom respiratory failure, due to extreme neuromuscular weakness, was produced by procainamide intoxication superimposed on a peripheral neuropathy secondary to long-term amiodarone therapy. Respiratory failure reversed rapidly after procainamide was discontinued, and the serum level fell to a therapeutic range.

Abstract: We report the findings in a patient in whom intravenous bretylium was the only effective agent to suppress refractory ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation. After attempts to switch the patient to amiodarone and bethanidine (an oral analogue of bretylium) caused proarrhythmic effects, he was successfully converted to oral therapy with bretylium. Electrophysiologic testing was not predictive of the clinical response from oral bretylium. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a proarrhythmic effect from bethanadine and it suggests a divergence in the actions of various class 3 antiarrhythmic agents.

Abstract: Amiodarone is an anti-arrhythmic drug with a content of 39% Iodine. No adverse effects on fetal thyroid function have previously been observed with maternal ingestion of Amiodarone during pregnancy. A case of severe congenital hypothyroidism with goiter, associated with maternal ingestion of 200 mg Amiodarone daily from the 13th week of pregnancy, is described here. No other environmental causes of goiter, nor a congenital organic thyroid disorder could be demonstrated.

Abstract: We treated a 78-year-old patient with hyperthyroidism and atrial fibrillation with amiodarone 1200 mg/day for 3 days and methimazole 60 mg/day. Sinus rhythm was restored within 3 days and serum levels of triiodothyroxine returned to normal within 4 days. A transient increase in serum rT3 concentrations was observed. Amiodarone associated with methimazole was useful in the management of atrial fibrillation and hyperthyroidism in our patient.

Abstract: A 3-week-old neonate with supraventricular tachycardia unresponsive to traditional therapy was treated successfully with amiodarone. An electrophysiologic study suggested the presence of a concealed left-sided accessory atrioventricular pathway. Because of its significant side effects, amiodarone should be used only as a last resort in the treatment of neonatal supraventricular tachycardia.

Abstract: Three patients who had incessant ventricular tachycardia and in whom a zone of slow conduction was identified are presented. Each patient's tachycardia was refractory to multiple antiarrhythmic drugs and was being treated with amiodarone at the time of the electrophysiologic study. The ventricular tachycardia cycle length was 500 to 580 ms. In Patients 1 and 2, a single site at the posterolateral wall or low septum in the left ventricle was identified at which overdrive pacing during ventricular tachycardia resulted in ventricular capture with a stimulus to QRS interval of 280 to 400 ms and with little or no change in the configuration of the QRS complexes during pacing as compared with during ventricular tachycardia. In Patient 3, the same phenomenon was observed at two areas in the left ventricle: at the inferior wall, overdrive pacing during ventricular tachycardia resulted in a stimulus to QRS interval of 440 to 470 ms, whereas at the posterolateral wall, the stimulus to QRS interval was 320 to 360 ms. Transcatheter shocks of 100 to 240 J delivered at the pacing sites have been successful in preventing recurrences of ventricular tachycardia over a follow-up period of 10 to 11 months. These observations may be explained by the pacing site being located within a reentrant circuit in a zone of slow conduction bounded by inexcitable tissue between the pacing site and the exit site of the reentrant circuit. In Patient 3, the variable stimulus to QRS intervals are explained by variable proximity of the pacing sites within the slow conduction zone to the exit site of the reentrant circuit.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Abstract: Amiodarone is an iodinated antiarrhythmic agent that is effective in the treatment of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. A number of side effects are seen, including pulmonary toxicity and thyroid dysfunction. A patient with both amiodarone-induced pneumonitis and hyperthyroidism who exhibited abnormal gallium activity in the lungs, as well as diffuse gallium uptake in the thyroid gland is presented. The latter has not been previously reported and supports the concept of iodide-induced "thyroiditis" with gallium uptake reflecting the inflammatory response.

Abstract: A severe case of flecainide-induced incessant ventricular arrhythmias is presented. These arrhythmias were resistant to various intravenous antiarrhythmic drugs and to cardiac pacing. Intravenous amiodarone administered over a short period and in a high dose strikingly abolished all ventricular arrhythmias.

Abstract: Amiodarone, an antiarrhythmic agent, has been associated with mild visual loss secondary to papillopathy and papilledema. We report a patient who developed bilateral optic neuropathy 4 weeks after initiation of amiodarone therapy. Nine months later, his vision was 20/50 in the right eye and 20/200 in the left. This report provides additional evidence that amiodarone may cause toxic optic neuropathy.

Abstract: Two patients with history of amiodarone-induced pulmonary reactions were accidentally treated again with amiodarone and the pulmonary complication recurred. The clinical symptoms and radiographic findings disappeared after amiodarone was discontinued and the administration of corticosteroids. Recurrent pulmonary reaction from amiodarone on different occasions is a rarely reported complication and confirms the relationship of pulmonary toxicity to chronic amiodarone administration.

Abstract: The antiarrhythmic agent amiodarone is associated with numerous adverse effects, but clinically significant liver disease is rare. A patient is described who presented with muscle weakness, hepatomegaly, and ascites following 28 months of amiodarone usage. His condition deteriorated despite discontinuation of amiodarone therapy. A postmortem liver biopsy demonstrated necrosis, fibrosis, hyalin, and phospholipid-laden lysosomal lamellar bodies. Resolution of hepatic dysfunction may not necessarily occur on withdrawal of amiodarone if irreversible damage is already established. We speculate as to the reasons for the reportedly low incidence of overt liver disease, and suggest that hepatic enzyme levels, as well as other indicators of hepatic function, such as the serum albumin concentration, be monitored indefinitely in all patients while taking amiodarone.

Abstract: Following treatment with amiodarone, a patient developed weight loss, fatigue and severe myopathy, without respiratory symptoms. A solitary lung infiltrate, impaired thyroid and liver function tests, and leukocytosis were evident. Biopsies from the lung lesion, liver, and bone marrow revealed foam cells. All these signs and symptoms subsided following cessation of amiodarone therapy. It is demonstrated that amiodarone may induce a localized lung lesion rather than diffuse pulmonary disease.

Abstract: A patient with clinically silent mitral valve prolapse experienced an episode of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation. This arrhythmia was easily replicated in the electrophysiology laboratory and despite treatment with amiodarone alone and amiodarone in combination with propranolol. Amiodarone in combination with quinidine prevented the induction of ventricular fibrillation and proved effective during a 3-year follow-up period. Even though a clear-cut relationship between the arrhythmias and mitral valve prolapse cannot be established, this case suggests that sudden death can occur in patients with mitral valve prolapse but without the known risk factors for the development of sudden death.

Abstract: A 41-year-old male patient developed amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis after 29 months of treatment with amiodarone. Thyrotoxicosis was readily reversible after cessation of the drug and did not need specific thyrostatic treatment. In contrast to what was expected, thyroglobulin serum concentrations, that were normal during the first 2 yr of follow up, decreased drastically to undetectable levels during and after the thyrotoxic phase. Although no explanation can be offered for this phenomenon, it seems important to point out the fact that measurement of thyroglobulin is of only limited value in the diagnosis of thyroid dysfunction in patients treated with amiodarone. Low levels do not exclude thyrotoxicosis.

Abstract: A 51-year-old female with a two-year history of palpitations associated with swallowing was evaluated by intracardiac electrophysiologic studies. Intracardiac recordings documented the presence of an ectopic left atrial focus induced by swallowing with no evidence of accessory pathway conduction. Gastrointestinal evaluation did not demonstrate any significant disorder. The tachycardia was refractory to all pharmacologic therapy including investigational therapy with mexiletine and amiodarone.

Abstract: A 72-year-old man had developed amiodarone neuropathy. He was found, at biopsy, to have a fascicular neuroma of his right sural nerve, unassociated with his underlying neuropathy, apparently due to blunt trauma, as electroneurographic needling of this nerve could safely be ruled out by the patient and his physicians. Such fascicular neuromas, which may remain without sensory deficits, may develop at an unknown frequency, and may only be uncovered by biopsy--or autopsy--in a coincidental neuropathic process.

Abstract: A case study is presented in which amiodarone (A) was given during the whole of pregnancy and during the breast feeding period. An intensive observation of thyroid tests, serum concentrations of A and its metabolite, desethylamiodarone (DEA) was undertaken. The child was observed in the same way from birth until 2 months of age. The milk was analyzed for A and DEA. As reported in other published cases, transplacental passage was found and there was a relatively high concentration of amiodarone in the milk. Our child like the other children was healthy at birth, being euthyroid and with no goiter or corneal deposits. No effect was observed of the medication on growth, thyroid tests or cornea. It is concluded that amiodarone can be given during pregnancy but it is advisable to use as low doses as possible and control the serum concentrations at regular intervals. Breast feeding need not be forbidden.

Abstract: Between October 1985 and October 1986, 37 patients, chronically treated with amiodarone, underwent general anesthesia for cardiac, thoracic or vascular surgery. Among them, the 8 non-cardiac surgery patients showed neither intra-, nor postoperative complications. The 29 cardiac surgery patients, had various complications ranging from dysrhythmias (52%), sometimes necessitating a pacemaker (24%), to marked and even fatal vasoplegia. We describe the only fatal case and compare our complication rate with that described in the available literature. Most complications could be symptomatically treated. In addition, amiodarone has a very long elimination half-life: therefore withdrawal before surgery implies delaying operations by several weeks, and puts patients at increased risk of malignant dysrhythmias. However, fatal vasoplegia does occur, and its real incidence should be assessed by a broader survey.

Abstract: A man complaining of palpitations was found to have ventricular tachycardia (VT) with LBBB configuration. From the investigations which followed, he was diagnosed as having arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD). The patient has been treated with amiodarone and propafenon for 7 months without VT recurrence. ARVD and Uhl's anomaly, which is its most extreme form, may be familial and represent an important cause of sudden death among young people: Prophylactic antiarrhythmic therapy and sometimes surgical treatment are required in case of refractory VT.

Abstract: Antiarrhythmic agents can influence defibrillation threshold (DFT). Basic research suggests that some class I drugs may have deleterious effects by raising defibrillation energy requirements. Evaluation of this problem in man has been limited to reports of patients who were more difficult to cardiovert or defibrillate after treatment with amiodarone and class IC agents. In the present report, mexiletine appeared to be the probable cause of an important elevation of DFT in a patient undergoing replacement of a malfunctioning automatic implantable cardioverter/defibrillator (AICD). This report and the accompanying literature review suggest that more information at both the basic and clinical levels is required. Retesting of device efficacy in terminating induced arrhythmia in the laboratory appears prudent in patients who require antiarrhythmic drug therapy subsequent to AICD implantation.

Abstract: A 35-year-old man, with recent onset angina, developed recurrent episodes of syncope due to ventricular tachycardia. His coronary angiogram showed normal coronary arteries and myocardial bridging of the left anterior descending causing severe systolic milking effect. Extensive invasive and noninvasive investigations did not reveal cardiac pathology other than the myocardial bridging. Electrophysiologic studies, not previously reported in myocardial bridging, demonstrated inducible sustained ventricular tachycardia at a rate of 280 beats/min. The possible relationship between the arrhythmia and the myocardial bridge is suggested. Combined medical treatment with amiodarone and diltiazem proved to be an effective alternative to surgical myotomy of the bridge.

Abstract: A rare case of amiodarone-iodine-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIIT) associated with nonthyroidal illness is reported. Serum total thyroxine (TT4) and free T4 (FT4) concentrations were elevated and serum TSH was undetectable as frequently observed also in euthyroid amiodarone-treated patients. At variance with common forms of AIIT, serum total triiodothyronine (TT3) was reduced due to low-T3 syndrome. The laboratory diagnosis was made on the basis of elevated free T3 (FT3) levels. Thus, in patients with severe nonthyroidal illness submitted to chronic amiodarone treatment, thyroid status can only be determined by free hormone measurement, particularly FT3 in the case of thyrotoxicosis.

Abstract: The case of a 69-year-old woman who developed muscle weakness on chronic amiodarone treatment is reported. Muscle biopsy showed vacuolar alterations and a marked accumulation of amiodarone and of its metabolite desethylamiodarone was found in the muscle sample despite normal blood levels. Amiodarone-induced morphological alterations of the muscle may be related to the actual tissue concentration rather than to the blood level.

Abstract: The autopsy tissues concentration of amiodarone and desethylamiodarone of a man with acute myocardial infarction treated acutely with intravenous amiodarone is reported. Our data indicate that amiodarone is quickly distributed into all highly perfused tissues after intravenous administration with a high amiodarone/desethylamiodarone ratio. We also report here the autopsy case of a woman who died after 30 days of oral therapy with amiodarone. The increase in heart/plasma ratio of amiodarone and desethylamiodarone concentrations and the decrease in amiodarone/desethylamiodarone ratio after one month of therapy could explain the latency in the antiarrhythmic action of the drug.

Abstract: A 22-year-old female, asymptomatic and without any evidence of cardiac disease, was found to have a persistent idioventricular tachycardia (IVT). Sinus rhythm and IVT rates were similar and showed parallel changes in successive resting electrocardiograms. Both IVT and sinus rhythm were transiently slowed or suppressed by vagal stimulation and accelerated by sympathetic stimulation. Long periods of atrial overdrive pacing, at a rate 62% faster than the spontaneous rate of IVT, depressed both ectopic and sinus activity. Fast channel blocking agents (lidocaine, disopyramide), and digoxin and amiodarone failed to modify IVT significantly. Verapamil, a calcium channel blocking drug, allowed total control of the arrhythmia. These electrophysiologic and pharmacologic responses suggest that the IVT may relate to the automatic activity of a ventricular focus of the "slow response" type, functionally resembling an "additional" sinus node with preserved innervation. During an 88-month follow-up, the patient continued to be asymptomatic, warning arrhythmias were never found and the features of IVT remained unmodified.

Abstract: Atypical manifestations of pulmonary toxicity and previously unreported autonomic nervous system dysfunction complicating amiodarone therapy were observed in a patient being treated for sustained ventricular tachycardia. Pulmonary and hepatic nodules on computed tomographic scan masquerading as metastatic carcinoma were initially noted. Focal infiltrates and a large left pleural effusion mimicking infection, malignant neoplasm, or collagen vascular disease became manifest at a later stage. Autonomic dysfunction presented as incapacitating orthostatic hypotension and persisted for six weeks after amiodarone withdrawal. The pleuropulmonary toxic effects were reversible on discontinuation of amiodarone therapy, and resolution was hastened by short-course steroid treatment.

Abstract: A case of pulmonary fibrosis attributed to amiodarone was studied immunologically and morphologically. A specific antibody of the IgG class was identified in the serum of this patient which reacted with the patient's own lung tissue. The immunoglobulin did not react with normal lung tissue nor was there evidence of reaction with lung tissue from patients with pulmonary fibrosis but without a history of amiodarone therapy. The patient probably developed a humoral antibody response to a lung-amiodarone complex with the amiodarone acting as a hapten which bound in vivo to the lung tissue. The subsequent antibody-antigen reaction stimulated a proliferation of pulmonary fibroblasts and probably enhanced the fibro-collagen deposition in the lung.

Abstract: Infants with incessant ventricular tachycardia (occurring greater than 10% of the day) have generally been described in pathologic studies. This report describes 21 patients with incessant ventricular tachycardia present greater than 90% of the day and night; the age at diagnosis ranged from birth to 30 months (mean 10.5 months). The most common clinical presentation was cardiac arrest (11 patients, in 5 after digitalis for presumed supraventricular tachycardia); another 6 patients had congestive heart failure and 4 were asymptomatic. Three patients had coexisting Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. The rate of incessant ventricular tachycardia ranged from 167 to 440 (mean 260 beats/min) and the QRS duration from 0.06 to 0.11 second. The most common electrocardiographic (ECG) pattern (10 of 21) was right bundle branch block with left axis deviation, but other right and left bundle branch block patterns were observed. Conventional and investigational antiarrhythmic agents (nine patients received amiodarone) failed to eliminate incessant ventricular tachycardia in all. Electrophysiologic studies localized incessant ventricular tachycardia to the left ventricle in 17 (to the apex in 2, the free wall in 9 and the septum in 6) and to the right ventricular septum in 4. No structural abnormalities were found on the echocardiogram or angiocardiogram. All 21 patients had surgery at an age of 3.5 to 31 months (mean 16). In 15 a tumor was found: 13 myocardial hamartomas (9 discrete, 4 diffuse throughout both ventricles) and 2 rhabdomyomas (1 multiple). Myocarditis was found in one patient (the oldest). In four, only myocardial fibrosis was found; results of one biopsy were normal.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Abstract: A 78-year-old man treated with amiodarone for recurrent ventricular tachycardia, had sequential placement of a bipolar VVI pacemaker and an automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator (AICD). During defibrillation threshold testing, there was failure to capture of the pacer in the post-shock period. The time of failure to capture appeared energy-related: the greater the energy delivered, the longer the failure to capture. Careful attention will be necessary in constructing combined AICD/pacemaker units.

Abstract: The ventricular rate during rapid atrial rhythms is related in Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome to antegrade effective refractory period of the accessory pathways. Among the many antiarrhythmic drugs available, amiodarone is most commonly used for its large therapeutic window and very long half-life. We report a case of cardiac pre-excitation syndrome in a young male patient in whom amiodarone therapy (3000 mg/weekly) was instituted to modify the dangerous ventricular response during atrial fibrillation (shortest R-R interval 190 ms, ventricular rate 210 beats/min). Four months later, starting pharmacological treatment, a new electrophysiological study documented a malignant ventricular arrhythmia: during atrial fibrillation the minimum R-R interval was 160 ms and the ventricular rate 280 beats/min. Finally, the possible mechanism of paradoxical effect observed in our patient is hypothesized. Amiodarone could favor conduction over the accessory pathways by slowing or blocking conduction into the atrioventricular node and decreasing concealed retrograde conduction into the accessory bypass tract by normally conducted beats.

Abstract: Optic neuropathy has been diagnosed in several amiodarone-treated patients, including the 13 patients described in this report. The clinical severity of this drug-related optic neuropathy is milder than that characteristically described in anterior ischemic optic neuropathy. The incidence of occurrence was significantly higher than that found in an age-matched general population sample. Whether this result was due solely to amiodarone therapy, to the underlying poor health of these patients, or to a combination of these two factors is uncertain. The findings in this study prompt us to recommend that all patients who receive amiodarone undergo complete ophthalmologic examinations, including careful evaluation of the ocular fundus regularly during such therapy. Appearance of optic neuropathy is probably a relative indication for discontinuing the use of the drug, in the hopes of avoiding bilateral involvement or perhaps recovering vision. The risks of complications of amiodarone treatment must be weighed against the benefit of therapy in patients whose lives are threatened by cardiac arrhythmias. On the basis of this study, the benefits of treatment seem to outweigh the small risk of optic neuropathy. No randomized study has been undertaken to determine the true incidence of complications associated with this medication and at this time could not be justified.

Abstract: A 52-year-old woman developed symmetric sensorimotor polyneuropathy and cerebellar syndrome after 24 months of amiodarone treatment. Sural nerve biopsy revealed mild demyelination and many inclusion bodies in the axoplasm and in Schwann cell cytoplasm. Improvement in her condition was evident 6 months after discontinuing amiodarone.

Abstract: We observed a dangerous increase of ventricular rate following the intravenous administration of amiodarone in a patient with atrial fibrillation and rapid ventricular response associated with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. The mechanism of enhanced accessory pathway conduction remains speculative. A possible explanation for the shortened antegrade effective refractory period of the accessory pathway is afforded by the hypotensive action of amiodarone or its dissolvent which might trigger beta-adrenergic reflexes. Intravenous amiodarone should be used with caution in patients with atrial fibrillation and rapid ventricular response via an accessory pathway.

Abstract: Therapy with the antiarrhythmic drug amiodarone has been associated with drug-related side effects. In addition to pulmonary fibrosing alveolitis, anecdotal reports have alluded to incidental pleural involvement associated with amiodarone. We describe an unusual manifestation of amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity in a patient with bilateral exudative pleural effusions and toxic involvement of other organs. We review amiodarone-associated pleural reactions reported in the literature.

Abstract: Amiodarone therapy for cardiac arrhythmias is increasingly being recognized to be associated with pulmonary toxicity. In this report, we describe the case histories of four patients with previously diagnosed amiodarone pulmonary toxicity in whom the adult respiratory distress syndrome developed after cardiothoracic operations for malignant ventricular arrhythmias. Three patients underwent endocardial resection (two died), and a fourth patient had implantation of an automatic defibrillator unit. Radiographic changes and results of pulmonary function testing are evaluated during initial toxicity and preoperatively. These four patients (mean amiodarone dosage of 420 mg/day for 20 months) are compared to 13 other patients undergoing cardiothoracic operations with prior amiodarone treatment (one patient with preoperative pulmonary toxicity) in whom life-threatening postoperative pulmonary complications did not develop (mean dosage of 550 mg/day for 10 months). Mean preoperative serum amiodarone levels for the four patients were 1.5 micrograms/ml. In the two patients who died, desethylamiodarone levels were 510 and 4,400 micrograms/gm in pulmonary tissue. Histologic examination showed "honeycomb" appearance of the lung with prominent septae, alveolar foamy macrophages, and hyperplasia of alveolar lining cells, consistent with amiodarone pulmonary toxicity. Causes including pump-oxygenator time, oxygen toxicity, anesthetic agents, congestive heart failure, and pulmonary infection superimposed on amiodarone pulmonary toxicity are discussed with a review of the literature.

Abstract: His bundle tachycardia is a rare arrhythmia in infants and children and is resistant to therapy. There is now sufficient evidence from reported cases and a further patient reported below to suggest that drug management of this arrhythmia is a reasonable alternative to His bundle ablation with life-long pacing from infancy.

Abstract: A 65 year old man developed atrial arrhythmias secondary to a congestive cardiomyopathy which were resistant to quinidine and disopyramide. Amiodarone controlled the paroxysmal atrial tachycardia but 4 months after starting the drug he developed increasing dyspnoea and radiological changes highly suggestive of metastatic lung disease. Lung biopsy showed change of drug-induced pneumonitis and 4 months after stopping amiodarone his symptoms resolved and the chest X-ray had cleared. Amiodarone may cause pulmonary toxicity mimicking metastatic lung disease.

Abstract: Torsade de pointes represents a potential complication of chronic amiodarone therapy. Several reports have emphasized the need for a loading dose in order to achieve therapeutic blood levels rapidly. We report a case of torsade de pointes following a single oral dose of amiodarone (1400 mg or 30 mg kg-1) administered after short intravenous loading for prevention of paroxysmal atrial flutter. Torsades de pointes were preceded and associated with marked QT prolongation and bradycardia. This report suggests that careful monitoring of patients undergoing oral amiodarone loading is necessary.

Abstract: Amiodarone, a new antiarrhythmic drug, may produce severe and potentially lethal pulmonary toxicity. A case is presented of a patient on amiodarone therapy who presented with recurrent pleural effusions and subsequently developed pulmonary infiltrates. The diagnosis of lung toxicity was documented by the cytologic examination of the pleural effusions and the bronchial washings. It was further supported by the ultrastructural demonstration of the characteristic cytoplasmic osmiophilic lamellar inclusions in the foamy macrophages. We conclude that cytologic and ultrastructural examinations of bronchial lavage cells are extremely helpful in the diagnosis of amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity.

Abstract: Amiodarone hydrochloride-induced thrombocytopenia seems to be an additional side effect in the course of amiodarone treatment. Two patients with thrombocytopenia during amiodarone treatment are described, in whom the diagnosis of amiodarone-induced thrombocytopenia was made by the fact that thrombocytopenia developed during amiodarone treatment and by rechallenge with the drug. Amiodarone-induced thrombocytopenia is probably due to delayed hypersensitivity reaction as indicated by the strongly positive lymphocyte stimulation test results using amiodarone. According to our results, platelet counts should be included in the routine follow-up of patients within the first two weeks after initiation of amiodarone treatment.

Abstract: Two contrasting cases of amiodarone hepatotoxicity are described. In one, perivenular collections of swollen cells, probably macrophages, with granular cytoplasm in an otherwise nearly normal liver were observed. Transmission electron microscopy showed that the cytoplasmic granularity was due to lysosomal bodies of various sizes. X-ray energy and wavelength spectroscopic analysis showed a high iodine content in these lysosomal bodies, good presumptive evidence of the presence of amiodarone or one of its metabolites. In the second case there was a micronodular cirrhosis, and similar granular cells also containing iodine were seen in the fibrous connective tissue. These cases seem to represent the very early and late stages of amiodarone hepatotoxicity. In a patient taking this drug aggregates of swollen granular cells may be a sensitive and histopathologically useful marker of early amiodarone toxicity.

Abstract: Recurrent ventricular fibrillation in a neonate after corrective surgery was effectively treated with intravenous amiodarone in addition to countershock. Amiodarone was administered in a loading dose of 1.3 milligrams per kilogram body weight in 12 minutes, followed by continuous infusion of 5.3 milligrams per kilogram body weight per 24 hours.

Abstract: Disc swelling and hemorrhages appeared in three eyes of two men receiving amiodarone hydrochloride for cardiac arrhythmias. The initial diagnosis was ischemic optic neuropathy, but visual acuity was preserved, and visual field changes were present in only one eye. Amiodarone is a cationic amphiphilic compound, and other drugs with this property have keratopathy, retinopathy, and optic neuropathy as side effects. We believe our patients had an amiodarone-induced papillopathy.

Abstract: A 50-year-old man had chronic atrial fibrillation that was refractory to conventional therapy. He was intolerant of amiodarone, but successfully managed by transcatheter atrioventricular junction ablation. Activity-initiated rate-responsive ventricular pacing resulted in a fourfold greater increase in cardiac output with exercise compared to fixed rate pacing.

Abstract: We describe a case with supero-inferior relations of the ventricles in which the atrio-ventricular and the ventriculo-arterial connexions were concordant and the interventricular septum was intact. In this patient there was associated Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. Positional anomalies of the heart, where there appears to be displacement of ventricular mass in the horizontal plane, add another dimension to the consideration of morphology and nomenclature. They emphasize the need for separate analysis and description of segmental connexions, relations and morphology.

Abstract: We used amiodarone as the only drug in three consecutive patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, marked systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve on M-mode echocardiogram, and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. The effective control of atrial fibrillation was associated with good symptomatic relief and with reduction until disappearance of the systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve. These data were confirmed in a follow-up of 46, 30 and 30 months.

Abstract: The new anti-arrhythmic agent, amiodarone, is increasingly recognized as a cause of pulmonary toxicity (APT). In the present series, 11 of 171 patients (6.4%) receiving the drug had APT develop. Clinical symptoms varied from mild cough and dyspnea to acute respiratory failure. Chest x-rays demonstrated alveolar and/or interstitial opacities in all 11 patients. The microscopic appearance of APT resembled that seen in lung injury from other drugs. The features were those of diffuse alveolar damage, ranging from the early acute to the organizing phase. Mural and intraalveolar foam cells were a prominent component. The epithelial origin of these cells was confirmed by positive immunoperoxidase staining for carcinoembryonic antigen. They were further identified as type II pneumocytes by electron microscopic examination. These findings support the concept that amiodarone is responsible for a drug-induced phospholipidosis. APT was clinically reversible in all patients; however, five patients (45%) died of arrhythmia shortly after discontinuation of amiodarone.

Abstract: A 54-year-old man on regular haemodialysis developed severe amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism after an unusually short latency period. The iodide accumulation and/or the derangement in thyroid function associated with chronic renal failure may predispose uraemic patients to this serious side effect of amiodarone. Although the pharmacokinetics of amiodarone are not altered by renal failure, caution is advised in prescribing this drug to uraemic patients.

Abstract: A 51-year-old housewife, who had been on treatment with amiodarone for ten months, developed a painful enlargement of the thyroid gland. Thyroid antibody titers were highly elevated and a fine needle aspirate of the gland showed infiltration of lymphocytes and plasma cells. Initially the patient was hyperthyroid, later she developed hyperthyroidism which required thyroid substitution. The possibility of amiodarone provoking autoimmune thyroiditis is discussed.

Abstract: We describe the appearance of long QT interval and polymorphous ventricular tachycardia in a patient treated with amiodarone who presented with hypokalemia secondary to chronic diuretic therapy. Ventricular pacing was initiated upon admission. The hypokalemia was corrected and amiodarone was discontinued. After three days the patient showed a normal QT interval and was free of ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Although hypokalemia could itself have been the arrhythmogenic factor in this particular patient, the additional toxic effect of amiodarone cannot be ruled out. It seems reasonable to consider the combination of both as dangerous when we take into account that the majority of patients cited as having amiodarone-induced torsade de pointes had also potassium depletion.

Abstract: The syndrome of sudden cardiac death in southeast Asians has only recently been given attention in the American medical literature. This case report describes a patient who presented with this rare syndrome. The physical examination, Holter monitor, 2-D echocardiogram, exercise treadmill test, radionuclide ventriculogram, coronary angiography, and endomyocardial biopsy were all normal. Programmed ventricular stimulation reproducibly induced sustained polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. Oral procainamide, oral quinidine and oral quinidine plus propranolol were not successful in suppressing inducible polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. The arrhythmia remained inducible after six weeks of oral amiodarone therapy. However, he has no clinical recurrences while on amiodarone after one year of follow-up.

Abstract: A patient who suffered from sinus node dysfunction and automatic atrial tachycardias underwent pacemaker implantation during which time a unilateral left superior vena cava was found. Despite the known difficulties in using this venous route, it was possible to place a transvenous endocardial screw-in lead in a stable position in the lower lateral wall of the right atrium.

Abstract: An implanted multiprogrammable pacemaker capable of performing both premature and burst stimulation can be teamed with a special external programmer for noninvasive electrophysiological testing. Such studies, combined with indications from provocative pharmacologic tests, allowed us to formulate effective antiarrhythmic therapies for three patients suffering from post-infarction, recurrent sustained ventricular tachycardia.

Abstract: A patient with acute changes suggesting acute hepatitis after parenteral amiodarone administration is described. A 77-year-old man with previous myocardial infarction was admitted with chronic left heart failure and atrial tachycardia. Initial hepatic function tests were strictly normal. After therapy with parenteral amiodarone (2300 mg in 3 days) and other measures, signs of congestive heart failure disappeared; subsequently the patient developed jaundice, marked increase in serum transaminase levels and fall in prothrombin time, and histologic changes of severe centrilobular necrosis were observed in hepatic biopsy. Clinical, laboratory (absence of others markers of hepatic disease), and histological findings seem to rule out common causes of hepatic disease. Therefore, parenteral amiodarone was implicated as the cause of acute hepatitis in this patient. In addition, there were findings suggesting a possibly immunologically mediated mechanism.

Abstract: Thyroid function was systematically evaluated in 15 consecutive children (mean age 13.7 years, range 0.5 to 19.5 years) before and serially during treatment with amiodarone (Cordarone), a potent antiarrhythmic agent. Amiodarone is known to affect thyroid homeostasis by competitive inhibition of 5'-monodeiodinase, which converts L-thyroxine (T4) to triiodothyronine (T3) and reverse T3 (rT3) to 3,3'-diodothyronine (T2), and also by the direct effects of its high iodine content (37% by weight). Clinical and/or biochemical evidence of hypothyroidism occurred in three patients, two of whom required treatment with L-thyroxine. An additional patient had persistent hyperthyroxinemia but no clinical evidence of hyperthyroidism. Results from the patients who remained euthyroid showed characteristic alterations in serum thyroid function tests. These included significant increases in serum T4, rT3, basal thyroid-stimulating hormone and thyroid-stimulating hormone response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone testing. These changes were considered to be compensatory adjustments by the pituitary-thyroid axis to competitive inhibition of 5'-monodeiodinase by the amiodarone. Routine screening of thyroid function is needed to allow early detection of hypothyroidism when these compensations fail to occur.

Abstract: A 67 year old man with recurrent hypotensive ventricular tachycardia, amiodarone-induced bradyarrhythmias and severe cardiac dysfunction underwent simultaneous implantation of an automatic cardioverter/defibrillator and bipolar atrioventricular (AV) pacemaker. The pacing electrodes were placed epicardially near the right atrial appendage and on the lateral right ventricular wall. The rate detector of the automatic defibrillator was placed epicardially on the posterobasal left ventricular wall. Effective bipolar AV pacing produced no false counting of the heart rate by the automatic cardioverter/defibrillator, and ventricular tachycardia properly inhibited the pacemaker. Long-term follow-up study confirmed the safety of this treatment. With proper precautions, bipolar AV pacing can be safely combined with an automatic cardioverter/defibrillator.

Abstract: Granulomatous involvement of the myocardium is of uncertain etiology, rarely diagnosed premorbidly, and the response to therapy is unknown. We report two patients with granulomatous disease apparently isolated to the myocardium, one presenting with cardiac arrest secondary to ventricular tachycardia, one with heart block. In both cases, the clinical rhythm was substantiated by electrophysiologic studies and neither case had evidence of significant myocardial dysfunction. In both, treatment was instituted with orally administered prednisone. One patient died suddenly two months following onset of therapy. Limited autopsy demonstrated no evidence of granulomatous involvement of the myocardium. The other patient is alive without clinical arrhythmias on amiodarone therapy; however, inducible ventricular tachycardia persists. Repeat endomyocardial biopsy in this patient demonstrated no granulomatous disease. These cases are discussed and the literature reviewed.

Abstract: Five patients had amiodarone hepatotoxicity detected on routine biochemical monitoring. Symptoms attributable to hepatotoxicity were minimal or absent; reversible hepatomegaly was seen in two patients, whereas three patients had signs of nonhepatic amiodarone toxicity before or with hepatotoxicity. Serum aminotransferase levels were elevated in all patients and alkaline phosphatase levels in four; no patient had hyperbilirubinemia or prolongation of the prothrombin time. Light microscopy showed steatosis, cellular degeneration, and cellular necrosis in the biopsy samples of four patients, whereas the fifth patient's sample had a granulomatous injury pattern. Electron microscopic study of liver tissue done in two patients showed phospholipid-laden lysosomal lamellar bodies. These findings suggest that both toxic and hypersensitivity liver injury can occur in response to amiodarone. The presence of phospholipid-laden lysosomal lamellar bodies may help differentiate amiodarone hepatotoxicity from alcoholic liver disease or other causes of hepatic steatosis.

Abstract: Five cases of amiodarone-induced syncope due to torsades de pointes or ventricular fibrillation are described. Amiodarone was used for recurrent supraventricular tachycardia in four cases and frequent ventricular extra systoles complicating congenital QT prolongation in the remaining case. Each was associated with a marked prolongation in the QTc interval following amiodarone. Three cases had had a previous history of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias secondary to anti-arrhythmic drugs. Hypokalemia may have been a contributory factor in two. The clinical features, predisposing factors, and treatment are discussed.

Abstract: The anaesthetic management of a patient with a phaeochromocytoma and cardiomyopathy is described. The control of dysrhythmias was the major problem. Ventricular dysrhythmias were treated with lignocaine, and intravenous amiodarone was used to control the supraventricular rhythm disturbances.

Abstract: Amiodarone has proved very effective in the treatment of otherwise resistant cardiac tachyarrhythmias. The use of amiodarone has, however, been limited due to its serious side-effects. A patient with cholestatic hepatitis due to amiodarone treatment is presented below and a review of the hepatotoxicity of amiodarone is given. It is concluded that solid evidence exists of hepatic injury due to amiodarone treatment, including steatosis, alterations resembling alcoholic hepatitis, cholestatic hepatitis and micronodular cirrhosis of the liver. Patients receiving amiodarone should be regularly screened with respect to hepatic enzyme levels. Therapy should be discontinued on the suspicion of cholestatic injury or hepatomegaly.

Abstract: A patient with atrial premature depolarizations developed pulmonary toxicity during long-term treatment with amiodarone. The clinical features were cough and dyspnea. Pulmonary function tests showed a restrictive defect and severe impairment of gas transfer. Diffuse interstitial and intra-alveolar shadows were noted on chest X-ray. Lung specimens obtained by transbronchial biopsy showed hyperplasia of pneumocytes and widening of the alveolar septa. After discontinuation of amiodarone and institution of steroid therapy the patient improved symptomatically, and after 3 weeks the chest X-ray showed clearing of the bilateral infiltrates. The patient was never given any other antiarrhythmic drugs, had no important heart disease, and received the lowest daily dose of amiodarone reported in the literature of cases of pulmonary injury.

Abstract: As a clinical entity atrioventricular (AV) block due to hypothyroidism is rare. Such a case induced by hypothyroidism complicating long-term therapy with amiodarone in a 45 year old woman with pre-excitation is presented. Electrophysiologic data obtained before and during thyroxine replacement therapy showed that hypothyroidism lengthens the effective refractory period of the atria, AV node, bypass tract and His-Purkinje system (that in the ventricle not being measured); this lengthening resembles the effects of long-term administration of amiodarone. These observations suggest that depressed thyroid function may be protective against arrhythmias but a patient with preexisting conduction system disease may develop AV block. The tendency to develop AV block in a patient who is euthyroid was reduced by bypass tract conduction. These findings are significant not only in monitoring amiodarone effects during chronic prophylactic drug therapy but also in providing further insight into the complex interrelation between the action of the drug and the thyroid hormones on cardiac muscle.

Abstract: A few cases of alcohol-like chronic liver disease have recently been described in patients on high daily doses of amiodarone (400-600 mg) for 5-24 months. We report here 3 cases in which similar lesions were observed after low daily doses of amiodarone. Daily dosage was 200 mg in 2 cases, 400 mg then 200 mg in the third one, and duration of therapy ranged between 36 and 60 months. Symptomatology was limited to hepatomegaly and/or mild elevation of serum aminotransferases. Liver biopsy showed alcohol-like lesions with fibrosis in 2 cases and cirrhosis in 1 case. Electron microscopy disclosed hepatic phospholipidosis. These cases indicate that chronic liver disease may be observed even when amiodarone is prescribed at low daily dosage, provided that duration of treatment is long. They also suggest that rather than the daily dosage, the cumulative dose of amiodarone is a major factor in the development of hepatic injury.

Abstract: Patients with sustained and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia may present the clinician with difficult management problems in the assessment of risk, decision for long-term treatment, and selection of appropriate therapy. Many therapeutic modalities are available, and combinations may be required in a comprehensive treatment program. The development of safer and more effective means for VT control is progressing and is needed. Nonetheless, the results of therapy with many of the treatment programs described are encouraging, as exemplified by the report from Graboys and coworkers. Long-term survival was studied in a group of 123 patients with malignant ventricular arrhythmia treated with antiarrhythmic drugs chosen primarily with noninvasive testing methods. In 98 patients in whom complex ventricular ectopy was controlled, there were 6 sudden deaths, that is, an annual mortality of 2.3 percent. In 25 patients in whom ectopy persisted despite drug therapy, there were 17 sudden deaths. Continued study of the specific mechanisms leading to ventricular tachycardia and sudden death are needed in order to control this increasingly prevalent clinical problem.

Abstract: We report a case of amiodarone-induced hepatitis accompanied by hyperthyroidism in which estimations of amiodarone in blood and in the liver and histological examinations were performed at the start and end of a 3-month interval. Our observation demonstrates the persistence in the liver of amiodarone and its principal metabolite for 3 months after the drug was withdrawn. There was no correlation between the persistence of the drug, the elevation of enzyme levels, and the extent of histological damage in the liver.

Abstract: A patient with sick sinus syndrome and resistant paroxysmal atrial flutter was treated with amiodarone and implanted with a Medtronic 7005 DDD pacemaker. Following discontinuation of amiodarone, an episode of sustained atrial flutter was converted to sinus rhythm by noninvasive rapid atrial pacing in the outpatient clinic. This case illustrates one of the many capabilities for arrhythmic intervention using currently available implanted pacemakers.

Abstract: Repetitive supraventricular tachycardia is an uncommon arrhythmia which usually occurs in patients free of structural heart disease. It is characterized by incessant short salvos of supraventricular tachycardia separated by only one or two normal sinus beats. Therapy with conventional antiarrhythmic drugs is usually ineffective. This report describes three patients with repetitive supraventricular tachycardia in whom evidence for associated sinus node dysfunction was observed. Amiodarone therapy, with ventricular pacing in two patients, has provided effective control of this arrhythmia in all three patients.

Abstract: Amiodarone is a cardiac antiarrhythmic agent now undergoing clinical trials in the United States. Its most important side effect is pulmonary toxicity, which may present radiographically in two forms. One is similar to eosinophilic pneumonia with peripheral alveolar opacities but without any of the laboratory or pathologic findings. A second presentation is as a bilateral interstitial pattern resembling interstitial pulmonary edema. This is often mistaken for heart failure in the clinical and radiographic setting. Amiodarone also causes a phospholipidosis of the liver, which is usually asymptomatic but on occasion may present as hepatitis. On abdominal CT the liver will have an abnormally high attenuation (80-140 HU), which appears to be due to accumulation of an amiodarone metabolite in hepatocytes. This appearance is usually distinguishable from the other causes of increased hepatic attenuation by virtue of other CT criteria and clinical history. However, from a radiographic standpoint alone, the combination of acute congestive heart failure and an abnormally dense liver may result in at least an initial misdiagnosis of advanced primary hemochromatosis.

Abstract: Atrioventricular (AV) junctional ablation was performed in a 59-year-old woman with recurrent atrial fibrillation refractory to treatment with digoxin, beta-blockers, verapamil, quinidine, procainamide, and amiodarone. She received two shocks of 500 J which produced complete AV block. After six weeks, both 24-hour ECG recordings and an exercise tolerance test showed infrequent premature ventricular complexes, 3 degrees AV block, and paced ventricular rhythm with 100 percent capture. She suddenly collapsed and was found to be in ventricular fibrillation and could not be resuscitated. Serial sections of the conduction system showed marked fatty infiltration of the approaches to the AV node with almost complete separation from the node. A partially fibrosed atrioHisian connection was also present. Fibroelastosis with chronic inflammatory changes was present in the AV node, bundle of His, and right and left bundle branches. In addition, marked inflammatory changes with fibrosis were present in the atrial septum, in the summit of the ventricular septum, with degenerative changes in the tricuspid and aortic valves. The sequelae of these findings outside the conduction system in other patients remains to be determined.

Abstract: Two recent reports support and one report disputes the existence of dangerous interactions between the new benzofuran antiarrhythmic amiodarone and the anaesthetic state. We have reviewed our experience with 17 anaesthetics administered to 16 patients taking amiodarone. Haemodynamics and serum amiodarone levels were evaluated where available. Twelve cases involved cardio-pulmonary bypass; of these, three patients died. There were no deaths in the non-cardio-pulmonary bypass group. The charts of 30 patients with poor left ventricular function, who were not receiving amiodarone but who were undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery, were reviewed to establish a comparison group. Interactions were manifested in three forms: nodal rhythm and/or complete heart block developed in ten of 15 patients (one patient had a preoperative pacemaker inserted for the sick sinus syndrome), poor cardiac output requiring intra-aortic balloon pump augmentation developed in six of 12 cardio-pulmonary bypass patients, or, a state of alpha adrenergic blockade leading to a low systemic vascular resistance despite alpha agonist therapy developed in two of 16 patients. We conclude that dangerous, fatal interactions may occur in patients taking amiodarone who undergo general anaesthesia with cardio-pulmonary bypass. Anaesthesia for non-cardiac surgery may be associated with haemodynamically significant bradyarrhythmias. We recommend aggressive invasive monitoring, including pulmonary artery catheterization and consideration of an atrio-ventricular pacemaker in high risk patients.

Abstract: Three patients who developed torsade de pointes associated with antiarrhythmic or psychotropic drugs are described, and the electrocardiographic characteristics, clinical presentation, predisposing factors, and management of this form of ventricular tachycardia are reviewed. The first patient was a 56-year-old schizophrenic man receiving thioridazine hydrochloride, trifluoperazine hydrochloride, and benztropine mesylate who was admitted to a hospital after a syncopal episode. Subsequently, the patient experienced several episodes of ventricular tachycardia combined with multifocal premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) and torsade de pointes; the arrhythmias were attributed to antipsychotic therapy. The second patient was a 69-year-old man who experienced ventricular tachycardia that progressed to ventricular fibrillation 41 days after surgery. Quinidine sulfate probably induced the ventricular tachycardia, which was identified as torsade de pointes. The third patient was a 71-year-old man admitted to the hospital for treatment of refractory ventricular arrhythmias. Previous drug therapy with quinidine sulfate and procainamide hydrochloride had been associated with torsade de pointes. Despite unsuccessful treatment of ventricular ectopy, the patient was discharged on maintenance therapy with pindolol, topical nitrates, and phenytoin. No additional episodes of torsade de pointes have been observed. Torsade de pointes is characterized by polymorphous electrocardiographic appearance and delayed repolarization (prolonged QT interval). It may occur in association with a number of disease states and also as a complication of treatment with therapeutic doses of drugs that affect repolarization (quinidine, disopyramide, procainamide, and phenothiazines). Clinical outcomes range from asymptomatic, self-terminating arrhythmias to ventricular fibrillation resulting in cardiac arrest. The definitive emergency therapy for torsade de pointes is overdrive pacing; cautious isoproterenol administration can also be used. Lidocaine and bretylium are often ineffective in treating this form of ventricular tachycardia. Potassium and magnesium repletion appear to be essential in abolishing drug-induced torsade de pointes. Drug-induced torsade de pointes is best prevented by avoiding agents known to induce arrhythmias in patients with a pre-existing prolonged QT interval. Periodic serum electrolyte assessment is warranted, and new drugs that prolong the QT interval should be considered potential causative agents of torsade de pointes.

Abstract: Bronchoalveolar lavage was used to demonstrate morphologic changes in alveolar macrophages characteristic of amiodarone effect in lung tissue obtained by biopsy. This procedure may be useful in the assessment of abnormal chest x-ray findings in patients suspected to have amiodarone toxicity.

Abstract: Amiodarone is an investigational antiarrhythmic agent known to cause pulmonary toxicity. This report describes two patients with previous amiodarone pulmonary toxicity and complete resolution who at rechallenge 5 to 6 months later developed within 2 weeks of therapy a significant reduction in lung diffusion capacity before overt clinical toxicity occurred. This suggests that toxicity may present early with reduction in diffusion capacity and that such changes may warrant the need to alter treatment.

Abstract: Use of amiodarone, an investigational antidysrhythmic agent, has been associated with cases of pulmonary toxicity. The mechanism of amiodarone pulmonary toxicity is unknown, and recommendations for the assessment and treatment of patients with this condition continue to evolve. In two patients with clinically diagnosed amiodarone pulmonary toxicity, a rapidly progressive and fatal adult respiratory distress syndrome developed after pulmonary angiography. Physicians should be aware of the potential for serious complications of pulmonary angiography in patients with presumed or clinically diagnosed amiodarone toxicity.

Abstract: Sural nerve changes are described in 2 cases of amiodarone neuropathy. Clinically, 1 patient developed a sensorimotor neuropathy, whereas in the other it was predominantly motor. Examination of sural nerves showed demyelination with only mild axonal loss. Cytoplasmic changes developed in Schwann cells of myelinated and unmyelinated axons, and involved loss of most recognizable organelles. These changes were associated with, and possibly preceded, myelin sheath breakdown. Inclusions, mainly of a lamellated type, were found in all cell types in the nerves. These inclusions, known to be lysosomal in origin, are a characteristic finding in amiodarone-induced neuropathy. The pathogenesis of the neuropathy is discussed, with particular reference to the findings in a parallel experimental study.

Abstract: Two asymptomatic patients from a group of 30 being treated with the antiarrhythmic drug amiodarone developed roentgenographic pulmonary and pleural reactions. Computed tomography in one patient with an uncommon radiographic pattern of fuzzy nodules showed the spatial distribution of the parenchymal changes, as well as unrecognized pleural thickening. The disease in these asymptomatic patients was presumably detected on the periodic chest roentgenogram at an early stage because the changes disappeared after withdrawal of the drug. Periodic chest radiographs are recommended during amiodarone therapy and CT may be useful in evaluation of patients with unusual chest radiographic findings.

Abstract: We observed sinoatrial block due to chronic amiodarone administration in a 5-year-old boy with primary cardiomyopathy, Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and supraventricular tachycardia. Reduction in the dosage of amiodarone resulted in the disappearance of the sinoatrial block and the persistence of asymptomatic sinus bradycardia.

Abstract: An atypical epididymitis syndrome developed in 6 of 56 men (11 per cent) treated with amiodarone, an effective new anti-arrhythmic agent. Of the 6 patients 5 (87 per cent) had bilateral epididymal enlargement and pain. The mean dosage in the patients with epididymitis was 700 mg. per day compared to 377 mg. per day in all patients (p less than 0.01). No infectious etiology was implicated in any patient. Temporary discontinuation or decrease in dosage is recommended for patients who suffer noninfectious epididymitis while on amiodarone therapy.

Abstract: Five patients developed neurological symptoms during treatment with amiodarone for intervals ranging between five and 40 months. In each case the daily maintenance dose did not exceed 600 mg. The neurological manifestations included gait ataxia, tremor, polyneuropathy, and myopathy. In all five patients, the neurological symptoms were severe and disabling. In one patient with a myopathy, there was no improvement after amiodarone was withdrawn. The neurological side effects of amiodarone may be disabling and are not always reversible with drug withdrawal. Neurological complications may arise during treatment with usual maintenance doses.

Abstract: Three patients developed peripheral neuropathy after taking amiodarone for more than 18 months. All had high serum concentrations of amiodarone and its desethyl metabolite; in one patient concentrations in a sural nerve biopsy were 80 times higher than in serum. Peripheral neuropathy is a complication of large doses of amiodarone taken over long periods.

Abstract: The use of amiodarone, a drug which is prescribed increasingly as an anti-anginal and anti-arrhythmic agent, necessitates a high index of suspicion for the development of thyroid disorders, especially thyrotoxicosis. Two cases, which illustrate the diagnostic dilemma of hyperthyroxinaemia and the poor response to antithyroid medication, are described. During amiodarone therapy, the clinical features of thyrotoxicosis may be masked or atypical, and the choice of therapy is complicated by a delayed response to thioamide drugs and possible contraindication for beta-blocking agents which necessitates the use of glucocorticoid drugs in some patients.

Abstract: A case of pneumonitis and pulmonary fibrosis occurring during long term treatment with amiodarone hydrochloride is described. The patient, a 68 year old woman, presented with severe dyspnoea and weakness 13 months after the institution of amiodarone therapy, 200 mg. bid 6 days/week. Chest x-ray showed patchy infiltrates involving the parahilar and medullary areas of both upper lobes. The clinical symptoms and the pulmonary signs improved only after amiodarone discontinuation and steroid treatment. Radiographic abnormalities gradually cleared over 45 days except for residual lines of fibrosis in the zones of previous alveolar consolidation still present 4 months later.

Abstract: A patient with sinuatrial disease and implanted pacemaker was treated with amiodarone (maximum dose 1000 mg, maintenance dose 800 mg daily) for 10 months, for control of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias. He developed pneumonitis, pleural and pericardial effusions, and a predominantly proximal motor neuropathy. Immediate but gradual improvement followed withdrawal of amiodarone and treatment with prednisolone. Review of this and previously reported cases indicates the need for early diagnosis of amiodarone pneumonitis, immediate withdrawal of amiodarone, and prompt but continued steroid therapy to ensure full recovery.

Abstract: Between January 1981 and April 1984, excessive serum concentrations of digoxin (5 ng/ml or higher) were recorded in 47 children, aged 2 days to 16 years. In 10 patients, the high concentrations were measured 9.25 to 48 hours after death and were significantly higher than antemortem levels in all cases (8.3 +/- 2.4 (+/- standard deviation) postmortem vs 3.3 +/- 1.5 antemortem, less than 0.0001). In 15 patients (40.5% of the living patients) serum concentrations of 5 ng/ml or higher reflected sampling errors; drug levels were monitored too closely to the administration of a dose. None of these children had toxic manifestations of digoxin. In 10 patients, the excessive concentrations were associated with renal failure and a prolonged elimination half-life (T1/2) of digoxin; in 3 of these patients, there were signs of digoxin toxicity. Six cases were caused by digoxin overdose (accidental ingestions, pharmacy error and a suicide attempt). In 6 additional cases, the existence of an endogenous digoxin-like substance (EDLS) was shown to contribute to the excessive levels of the drug. One case could be attributed to digoxin-amiodarone interaction. In 10 of 37 living patients, digoxin toxicity was diagnosed. After excluding the 15 sampling errors and 6 cases with EDLS, this represents 63% of the cases. There was a good correlation between digoxin elimination T1/2 and serum creatine concentrations (r = 0.71, p less than 0.01). The above observations suggest that excessive serum concentrations of digoxin may not necessarily reflect potentially toxic levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Abstract: A 61 year old man with mild aortic stenosis and chronic depression took 12.5 mg digoxin in a suicide attempt. Ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation were resistant to lignocaine and to phenytoin but responded to intravenous amiodarone, with restoration of pacing. Because of persistent hyperkalaemia he was also treated with Fab fragments of digoxin specific antibody, which bound most of the ingested digoxin. It is suggested that the treatment of choice in severe digoxin poisoning is amiodarone for ventricular arrhythmias followed by pacing if necessary and the use of Fab antibody fragments if hyperkalaemia persists.

Abstract: Fabry's disease is an X-linked recessive inborn error of metabolism, caused by a deficiency of alpha galactosidase A. This report describes a heterozygote patient with multiple system problems diagnosed eventually as Fabry's disease by the ocular findings. The clinical diagnosis was confirmed by enzymatic assay. Our report emphasizes: The variability of the non-ocular manifestations in the heterozygote of Fabry's disease. The diagnosis of Fabry's disease in our patient was made by the ophthalmologist. The ultra-structural changes in the cornea and conjunctiva of the heterozygote confirm those reported in the literature; in addition we describe changes in the goblet cells. The clinical and ultra-structural similarities of the deposits in Fabry's disease, Chloroquin keratopathy and Amiodarone keratopathy are striking and will be discussed.

Abstract: We report two patients who developed symptomatic life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias with changing QRS axes (resembling torsades de pointes), during treatment of their supraventricular tachycardias with oral amiodarone. Like other effects of amiodarone on the body, the arrhythmias became evident several days after initiating therapy, at which time electrocardiographic QT prolongation was present. The arrhythmias subsided after amiodarone treatment was withdrawn. No other drugs or electrolyte disturbances could be incriminated as a cause.

Abstract: Amiodarone (Cordarone) is an iodinated compound widely used in the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias for more than a decade. A patient who developed a persistent blue-gray skin pigmentation of the light-exposed areas following long-term amiodarone hydrochloride administration is reported. The cutaneous signs and the ultrastructural findings are described. This rare iatrogenic hyperpigmentation is peculiarly due to lipofuscin and not melanin deposits. Its pathogenesis may be related to the basic action of the drug on the lysosome and to the extra phototoxic-induced lysosomal damage, which accounts for the specific location of the hyperpigmentation over the light-exposed areas.

Abstract: A dose-dependent cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis developed in a 34 year old man who was given amiodarone for supraventricular tachycardias resistant to other drugs. This adverse reaction disappeared within 2 weeks after discontinuation of amiodarone despite its very long half-life of 52 days in this patient. During previous treatment periods with amiodarone, the patient had experienced photosensitivity and dose-dependent polyserositis. Since high doses of amiodarone have been recently proposed for the treatment of resistant cardiac arrhythmias, dose-dependent adverse effects as described here may be encountered with increasing frequency.

Abstract: The problem of a possible interaction between amiodarone and digoxin is still unsettled. We have recently treated two patients with digoxin intoxication who had received amiodarone for eight and 36 months respectively. Both developed extreme bradycardia requiring temporary pacemakers. The presence of hypothyroidism was confirmed in both cases by laboratory data. Judging by present knowledge concerning the interaction between amiodarone, thyroid function, and digoxin, it is suggested that digoxin intoxication was not the result of its direct interaction with amiodarone. The possibility that amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism precipitated digoxin intoxication seems to be more plausible. Prevention of digitalis toxicity in amiodarone-treated patients would therefore require monitoring of thyroid function every three to six months. Frequent monitoring of digitalis blood levels is also indicated in patients with amiodarone associated hypothyroidism. Early detection of hypothyroidism and digitalis intoxication is necessary in view of the severity of the course of the disease.

Abstract: Amiodarone, an antiarrhythmic agent, is known to induce pulmonary toxicity in some patients. Previously described radiographic findings include alveolar and interstitial infiltrates. We report a patient who developed biapical infiltrates on chest X-ray film and demonstrated an unusual, symmetric appearance on CT. Correlative postmortem histologic findings are presented. Amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity should be considered in the differential diagnosis of pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates seen on CT of patients receiving this medication.

Abstract: The mechanism of amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity is unknown. Two cases of amiodarone pulmonary toxicity are presented in which abnormal inclusion bodies containing whorls of membrane were seen on electron microscopy of extrapulmonary tissues. These cytoplasmic lysosomal inclusion bodies were observed in lymphocytes, plasma cells, granulocytes, tissue macrophages, and hepatocytes. These widespread histopathologic changes in extrapulmonary tissues and in a variety of cell types are similar to more extensively investigated findings in animal models that are thought to represent a drug-induced lysosomal storage disease, phospholipidosis.

Abstract: An Omni Orthocor 234A special device pacemaker was implanted in nine patients for treatment of drug-resistant supraventricular tachycardia (three patients) or ventricular tachycardia (six patients). This device is activated using a special external unit, which delivers from six to 15 stimuli at preselected coupling intervals ranging from 195 to 500 ms. Serial noninvasive electrophysiology studies were performed either in the hospital or on an outpatient basis using the triggered mode, which can respond to programmed chest wall stimulation. Three patients with reciprocating supraventricular tachycardia were treated effectively by this device during an average follow-up of 2.2 years. Of the six patients with stable ventricular tachycardia amenable to pacemaker termination, only four remained successful during an average follow-up of 1.9 years. Such devices may find important use in serial noninvasive electrophysiologic testing during long-term clinical follow-up. The present form of this device is inadequate for widespread application, but may be useful for highly selected individuals.

Abstract: Two cases are reported in which amiodarone was administered during pregnancy for longer periods than has been reported previously. Limited placental transfer of amiodarone and its desethyl metabolite was observed in both cases. A normal child resulted from each pregnancy despite, in one case, amiodarone therapy throughout the entire pregnancy. However, caution is urged in the use of amiodarone during pregnancy in view of the limited data available.

Abstract: Photographs of amiodarone-induced anterior subcapsular lens opacities and axial punctate lens opacities are presented and compared for the first time. The similarities and differences between these lens opacities and phenothiazine-induced lens opacities are discussed. Potential etiologies for anterior subcapsular cataracts are reviewed. The biomicroscopic techniques required to appreciate subtle lens opacities are mentioned. The importance of recognizing and recording subtle lens opacities is discussed.

Abstract: During treatment with amiodarone, digoxin and nadolol, asystole occurred repeatedly in a patient with chronic persistent automatic atrial tachycardia. Asystole did not occur after discontinuation of drug therapy, and rechallenge with amiodarone alone produced marked overdrive suppression of all pacemakers resulting in asystole. Amiodarone serum level was within therapeutic range. The possible electrophysiologic mechanisms by which amiodarone might suppress both normal and abnormal pacemakers are discussed. The occurrence of asystole at therapeutic serum concentration of amiodarone suggests that this drug should be used with caution.

Abstract: Among 509 patients referred to our Institute for Holter monitoring, between 1st September, 1982-30th October, 1983, 28 patients aged 65-90 (mean 76) were referred for dizziness and syncope. There were 17 men and 11 women. Seven patients had a M.I. in their past, 4 angina pectoris, 5 hypertension, 4 aortic stenosis or aortic insufficiency or both, hemodynamically significant, one had mitral valve prolapse (MVP) and one transient ischemic attacks (TIA). In our series 16 out of 28 patients received digoxin and antiarrhythmic drugs (quinidine, propranolol, procainamide, Neo-gilurythmal, amiodarone), 2 of them digoxin and quinidine in full doses and one digoxin and amiodarone. Other drugs administered to our patients included Aldomin, Isordil, Lasix, aminophylin, cromoglycate etc. In 10 patients (35.7%) we found complex ventricular arrhythmias (7 with M.I., 3 patients of 4 with significant aortic valve lesion, 2 patients of 2 with left anterior hemiblock (LAH), 1 patient with MVP, 1 patient with TIA). In another 5 patients (17.8%) we found atrial fibrillation, fast rhythm (2 with chronic obstructive lung disease, 2 with hypertension and 1 in post M.I.) which explained their symptomatology. From our data we conclude that the pluripathology found in old age as well as the multimedication administered, cause a plurietiology of syncope, arrhythmias playing an important role in its determination, in this particular age group.

Abstract: A 48-year-old man with symptoms of presyncope and congestive cardiac failure had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) without obstruction. Complete heart block (CHB), a rare complication of this disease, was preceded by complete left bundle-branch block. Right ventricular (RV) heart failure was a dominant clinical feature but improved dramatically after temporary transvenous RV pacing prompting the insertion of a permanent RV inhibited pacemaker. Repeated ventricular fibrillation was successfully controlled by amiodarone. This is the seventh case of HCM complicated by CHB reported in the literature, and the first in which RV endomyocardial biopsies were undertaken. Two other patients reported in the literature had RV inhibited permanent pacemakers implanted, and a further 2 had atrioventricular sequential pacemakers.

Abstract: Two patients are described, in whom ventricular pacing at physiological rates (72 to 75 beats/min) repeatedly induced ventricular tachycardia (VT). In the first patient, pacing was required because of complete atrioventricular block following an inferior and right ventricular (RV) myocardial infarction. VT developed during RV posterobasal pacing, but not during RV outflow tract pacing at similar rates. The second patient had a postinfarction left ventricular aneurysm and was paced because of amiodarone-induced sinus node dysfunction. VT developed when the rate of ventricular pacing was similar to that of the sinus rate. We conclude that in patients whom VT is induced at physiological rates of pacing, the following factors may be involved in the triggering of VT: the rate of pacing, the site of ventricular stimulation; and the administration of antiarrhythmic drugs. Early recognition of these factors, which may facilitate reentry by aggravating previously existing intraventricular conduction disturbances, is imperative for the effective management of the arrhythmia.

Abstract: Amiodarone hydrochloride is currently being investigated in the United States as a cardiac antiarrhythmic agent. Previous reports from Europe indicate that amiodarone occasionally causes a cutaneous photosensitivity reaction that may be associated with a peculiar blue-gray discoloration of the skin. In addition, corneal microdeposits of yellow-brown granules may occur. We report observations on a case of amiodarone photosensitivity and corneal deposits developing in a patient shortly after amiodarone therapy was begun. Symptoms included burning and stinging of the skin, with redness and swelling that developed immediately after sun exposure. Phototesting showed that the photoactivating wavelengths were primarily in the long-wave UV-A spectrum between 350 and 380 nm. Prior application of a 10% dioxybenzone sunscreen greatly reduced the phototest reaction. Four weeks after the patient stopped taking amiodarone, the UV-A sensitivity was still present but diminished, and by ten weeks it had disappeared. During this time, the corneal deposits were reduced in number. All ten patients we have treated so far with amiodarone for cardiac arrhythmias have shown a similar photosensitivity, indicating that this is probably a phototoxic reaction.

Abstract: In a 61-year-old man receiving chronic low-dosage amiodarone an interstitial pneumopathy was observed. In the absence of other causes, we suspected an adverse reaction to amiodarone, not least because of the similarity with histologic findings of cases previously reported. Drug withdrawal and cortisone administration led to resolution of the disease.

Abstract: We report a patient with fibrosing alveolitis associated with amiodarone therapy. Review of the literature suggests that amiodarone induced pulmonary disease generally occurs on a maintenance dose of at least 400 mg of amiodarone daily; there is however a wide range in the duration of therapy or total dose administered prior to presentation.

Abstract: This paper describes the pathology of pulmonary histiocytosis developing in a patient treated with amiodarone, and reports comparable changes in the lungs of rats and mice to which this drug had been administered. Ultrastructural studies indicate that the experimental lung changes are similar to those produced by iprindole and chlorphentermine. The patient also displayed focal necroses and an eosinophilic bronchiolitis; these may represent further effects of amiodarone on the lung.

Abstract: Amiodarone is a potent new antiarrhythmic drug that has multiple effects on thyroid function, including inhibition of extrathyroidal triiodothyronine production and rarely, iodine-induced hypothyroidism. This report describes a man with recurrent ventricular tachycardia in whom hypothyroidism developed during amiodarone therapy and who died of probable myxedema coma. Parenteral and oral thyroxine therapy promptly reduced serum thyroid-stimulating hormone concentrations without increasing the patient's very low serum triiodothyronine concentration. This response to thyroxine suggests that thyroxine itself may have biologic activity and participate directly in regulation of thyrotropin secretion. Because amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism may be life-threatening, thyroid function should be monitored before and during amiodarone therapy, and the drug discontinued or appropriate therapy instituted if hypothyroidism develops.

Abstract: A 20 year old patient with myotonic dystrophy presented with hemodynamically significant ventricular tachycardia at a rate of 230 beats/min requiring cardioversion. Two days later, the identical tachycardia was reproducibly initiated and terminated in the electrophysiology laboratory using two extrastimuli in the right ventricle. Trials of procainamide and quinidine were not successful in controlling the induced rhythm and amiodarone was administered. On restudy with amiodarone, ventricular fibrillation was induced using a single extrastimulus. This case suggests that ventricular tachyarrhythmias may contribute to the known cardiac morbidity and mortality in myotonic dystrophy.

Abstract: We describe a patient with bronchial asthma whose respiratory symptoms worsened during treatment and rechallenge with amiodarone. Laboratory studies on cultured pulmonary cells demonstrated an anti-beta-adrenergic effect of amiodarone not due to inhibition of beta-adrenergic receptor binding. Amiodarone should be used with caution in patients with obstructive pulmonary disease.

Abstract: We report a case of perhexilene maleate (PEXID) toxicity in which the presenting feature was loss of vision secondary to chronic papilloedema. Vortex keratopathy similar to that seen in amiodarone keratopathy was present, and corneal and conjunctival biopsy findings are presented. To our knowledge this is the first case report of a keratopathy occurring in perhexilene toxicity. After withdrawal of the drug the papilloedema and keratopathy subsided, but some visual deficit remains. The properties of perhexilene maleate and other amphiphilic drugs are described, and the possible aetiology of vortex keratopathy is discussed.

Abstract: Iodine-induced hyperthyroidism has been frequently described when iodine is introduced into an iodine-deficient area. However, it may also occur in patients with and without previous thyroid disease residing in iodine-sufficient areas. Five patients with iodine-induced hyperthyroidism seen in a 12-month period are described. All were exposed to iodine in the form of commonly used drugs (Betadine, Iodo-Niacin, amiodarone, and radiographic contrast dyes). The cause of iodine-induced hyperthyroidism is unclear, but it is probably more common in patients with goiters containing previously existing areas of autonomous function or iodine-poor thyroglobulin. Iodine-induced hyperthyroidism usually abates after iodine withdrawal in patients with multinodular goiters or normal thyroid glands. The hyperthyroidism is usually treated with beta-blockers and antithyroid thionamide drugs, although reinstitution of iodine to block thyroid hormone release or corticosteroids occasionally may be necessary. Iodine-containing drugs should be given with caution to patients with underlying thyroid disease.

Abstract: Two patients, one with and one without preexisting conduction system abnormalities, were treated with amiodarone for refractory ventricular arrhythmias. Electrophysiologic testing before and during amiodarone therapy revealed amiodarone-induced HV interval prolongation and second degree intra-His Wenckebach block with no change in QRS configuration during atrial pacing at relatively long cycle lengths. The mechanism responsible for this phenomenon is unclear. These cases illustrate that amiodarone can induce distal conduction system block even in the absence of clinical conduction system disease in a pattern that mimics atrioventricular nodal block.

Abstract: A patient with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome manifesting four types of tachycardia is described. The location and the participation during tachycardia of two different types of accessory atrioventricular pathways were documented during a programmed stimulation study. Unusual modes of initiation of tachycardias were observed, such as the initiation of an orthodromic circus movement tachycardia by an atrial premature beat that conducted in anterograde direction down the accessory pathway.

Abstract: A 56-year-old man with the Wolf-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome (type A) is described. His presenting signs were paroxysmal atrial tachycardia and fibrillation induced by swallowing. This supraventricular tachyarrhythmia (SVT) could be abolished by performing the valsalva maneuver or carotid stimulation, and prevented only by treatment with amiodarone.

Abstract: Amiodarone is an antiarrhythmic agent with high iodine content. Ten patients treated with amiodarone developed thyrotoxicosis. I131 uptakes were negligible, and TT3 levels low in relation to TT4 levels, and sometimes even normal. Cessation of amiodarone caused thyroid functions to return to normal in one to five months, unrelated to propylthiouracil treatment. Eight of the patients had normal thyroid glands on radioscan or palpation. All patients tested had normal TRH tests. Thyrotoxicosis is a relatively common complication of amiodarone treatment, probably caused by its high iodine content. It is possible in apparently normal thyroid glands, suggesting failure of the homeostatic mechanisms controlling thyroid synthesis and release in these patients. Amiodarone is very efficient in controlling tachyarrhythmias and angina pectoris, situations in which thyrotoxicosis is dangerous. Thyroid function tests should therefore be drawn periodically, and the complication considered whenever tachyarrhythmias worsen on treatment with amiodarone.

Abstract: Two patients developed rapid His-Purkinje reentrant tachycardia during programmed ventricular stimulation for evaluation of recurrent ventricular tachycardia. In Patient 1, His-Purkinje reentry induced a morphologically distinct ventricular tachycardia which may have been a reentrant circuit operating independently for several cardiac cycles. His-Purkinje reentry was not inducible in Patient 2 until lidocaine was given. Following lidocaine administration, sustained His-Purkinje reentrant tachycardia was initiated by 2 premature ventricular stimuli. The tachycardia was rapid (240 beats per minute) and required cardioversion.

Abstract: A patient with automatic atrial tachycardia refractory to all conventional therapies is described. Amiodarone controlled the tachycardia by causing a progressive decrease in the rate of discharge from the atrial focus. We conclude that 1) amiodarone was effective therapy for automatic atrial tachycardia, avoiding the need for nonmedical therapy; and 2) amiodarone appeared to act by decreasing spontaneous automaticity.

Abstract: Muscle weakness, neuropathy, and transient rises in hepatic enzyme activity have been reported with the use of the antiarrhythmic agent amiodarone. A 68 year old teetotaller with normal liver function was given amiodarone for resistant supraventricular arrhythmias. He presented 19 months later with vomiting, muscle weakness and wasting, sensory neuropathy, and hepatomegaly. Liver biopsy showed fibrosis and the presence of hyaline. The amiodarone was withdrawn. Three months later he developed ascites. Oesophageal varices were found and he later died. The liver showed micronodular cirrhosis. The large volume of distribution and long half life of amiodarone may explain the persistence of toxicity, which may have been aggravated by simultaneously administered doxepin in this case. Amiodarone should be withdrawn if abnormal liver function or neuropathy develops.

Abstract: Recurrent atypical ventricular tachycardia, with a long QT interval, was documented in a 56-year-old patient 16 days after discontinuing amiodarone 200 mg and 400 mg on alternate days. Tachycardia and variable prolongation of myocardial repolarization were abolished by temporary cardiac pacing and correction of mild hypokalaemia.

Abstract: Ocular observations in a series of 100 patients treated with amiodarone, along with the pathological changes observed in the eye tissues of two patients treated with this drug, are described in this paper. In the latter two patients intracytoplasmic membrane-bound lamellar bodies similar to myelin were observed by electron microscopy not only in the corneal epithelium and fibroblasts, the conjunctiva and the lens, but also in the corneal endothelium, the iris, the ciliary body, the choroid and the retina. It is suggested that patients taking amiodarone in high dosage for long periods have their eyes and retinal function monitored.

Abstract: Amiodarone hydrochloride, an investigational drug used to suppress ventricular arrhythmias, may cause pulmonary toxicity with associated radiographic abnormalities. Two patients are presented who illustrate the variability of these abnormalities. One of these patients died of respiratory failure while the other recovered after amiodarone was stopped and corticosteroid therapy was started.

Abstract: Amiodarone hydrochloride is a noncompetitive adrenergic blocker used in the treatment of tachyarrhythmias. Its use in Europe and South America has been associated with cutaneous pigmentation thought to be caused by lipofuscin deposition in the dermis. We describe a similar case occurring in North America. A skin biopsy specimen from the patient was examined by light microscopy, fluorescence microscopy, and electron microscopy. From these examinations, a diagnosis of dermal lipofuscinosis was made.

Abstract: Amiodarone is a new and powerful antiarrhythmic agent currently under investigation in North America. In the past two years, there have been increasing reports of serious side effects associated with its use, including 14 cases of pneumonitis or pulmonary fibrosis. This report describes a case of acute necrotizing pneumonitis, a complication that has not been observed previously with amiodarone therapy. Amiodarone also appeared to alter carbohydrate metabolism in this patient. Metabolic changes induced by this drug may be mediated by superoxide radicals. A high index of suspicion for pulmonary complications should be maintained in patients taking amiodarone, and nonspecific respiratory complaints should be investigated carefully.

Abstract: The hepatic morphological findings in 3 patients treated with amiodarone, a potent and effective antiarrhythmic drug, are reported. An enlarged liver and mild elevation of hepatic enzymes were the most important clinical findings. Fibrosis, cholangitis, mixed inflammatory infiltrate, and cytoplasmic granularity of the hepatocytes were the main histologic changes common to all cases. In 2 of the cases the presence of Mallory bodies was confirmed by electron microscopy. In 1 of these 2 cases, Mallory bodies were also confirmed by immunostaining. Ultrastructurally, numerous cytoplasmic inclusions with a membranous or lamellar structure identical to those described in phospholipidosis were the most striking features seen in hepatocytes, biliary epithelial cells, Kupffer cells, and endothelial cells.

Abstract: We report the case of a patient who developed a life-threatening polymorphous ventricular tachycardia ( PVT ) after six weeks of treatment with amiodarone. The Q-T interval was markedly prolonged at 0.86 second. The drug induction of PVT was strongly suggested by the fact that PVT resolved four days after withdrawal of amiodarone when the Q-T interval had shortened to 0.60 second; the arrhythmia has not recurred in the nine months of follow-up since then. Amiodarone, though a very effective antiarrhythmic agent, may induce serious PVT .

Abstract: A new method has been used to measure tissue levels of amiodarone and its major metabolite desethylamiodarone. Amiodarone-pigmented skin has a drug and metabolite concentration ten times that of non-pigmented skin. Iodine-rich amiodarone and its metabolite have been detected in secondary lysosomes by energy dispersive analysis of X-rays. Amiodarone induces a phototoxic reaction with an action spectrum in both the UV-B and UV-A wavelengths.

Abstract: The addition of amiodarone to digoxin therapy in nine children caused a sharp increase in digoxin serum concentrations (68% to 800%) in the presence of preserved serum creatinine and BUN concentrations. Digoxin half-life was prolonged. Digoxin accumulation could be attributed in part to the decrease in the renal clearance of digoxin resulting from inhibited tubular secretion of the drug and to the reduction in the distribution volume of digoxin caused by amiodarone. Creatinine clearance was not affected by amiodarone. This interaction appears to be more acute in children than in adults, presumably because of the more important role of the renal tubular secretion of digoxin in children. Whenever digoxin and amiodarone therapy are combined, the digoxin serum concentration should be monitored carefully, with appropriate reduction of the digoxin dose.

Abstract: A 34-year-old man was hospitalized for extensive antero-apical myocardial infarction. Eight weeks after discharge from the hospital, he had intermittent rapid palpitations. During several episodes, a rapid, regular, wide-QRS-complex tachycardia with left bundle branch (LBB) morphology was recorded. All antiarrhythmic agents administered to the patient were unsuccessful in alleviating his symptoms, which were thought to be due to supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) with aberration. An electrophysiologic study was performed and revealed three morphologically distinct types of wide complex tachyarrhythmias: 1) Tachycardia 1 was determined to be A-V re-entry with antegrade conduction utilizing the normal A-V conducting system and retrograde conduction over a concealed accessory pathway located in the left A-V groove; 2) tachycardia 2 was identified as ventricular tachycardia (VT); and 3) tachycardia 3 was considered to be a second morphologic type of ventricular tachycardia as the morphology was identical to some of the episodes documented clinically. The patient was treated with oral amiodarone which was unsuccessful until combined with quinidine; this regimen has suppressed recurrence of VT during a four-month period of follow-up. The occurrence of wide-QRS-complex tachycardia in this patient immediately suggested the diagnosis of VT, but our other findings were unexpected. This case illustrates the need for considering all possible mechanisms when seeking to manage tachyarrhythmias, even if the diagnosis appears obvious.

Abstract: The possibility of adapting multimode dual-chamber pacemakers for programmed and burst stimulation was explored in a group of patients with ventricular tachycardia. The potential usefulness and pitfalls of these pacemakers were exemplified in one patient, presented in detail. The implanted DDD pacemaker was programmed to an all-synchronous mode (DDT), permitting programmed ventricular stimulation through synchronization with chest wall stimulation provided by a standard external programmable stimulator. With the ventricular sensing refractory period shortened to 200 ms, both programmed electrical stimulation and burst pacing for termination of induced tachycardias were possible. When medications failed to offer protection against the patient's tachycardias, the ventricular sensing refractory period (and minimum stimulation interval) was increased to 300 ms, thereby permitting burst pacing at up to 200 beats/minute for termination of spontaneous episodes. After many trials to confirm the efficacy of such stimulation, and the lack of muscle potential triggering, the patient was discharged home with the pacemaker in the DDT mode. He was instructed to go to his local emergency room, and was equipped with a portable device to trigger his implanted unit. Subsequently, the patient had successful termination of several spontaneous episodes of ventricular tachycardia in an emergency room. Later, he began to experience palpitations during certain exercises, and it was found that the implanted unit was being triggered by pectoral myopotentials. The unit was therefore reprogrammed to decrease the sensitivity, and the patient was again discharged. The need for careful evaluation and close follow-up is emphasized to maximize the benefits and to minimize the very serious potential risks of this pacing mode.

Abstract: This is the first report of the successful use of magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) in 3 consecutive patients with torsades de pointes (TdP). In 1 patient, TdP was induced by a combination of quinidine and amiodarone, in the second by procainamide, and in the third by an overdose of imipramine. The QT intervals before TdP were 0.70, 0.64 and 0.56 second, respectively. A bolus of 1.0 to 2.0 g MgSO4 25% abolished the TdP in all 3 patients; but in the third patient, because of recurrent TdP, a second bolus of 1.0 g and a continuous 24-hour infusion of 1.0 mg/min were administered, preventing TdP. There was no immediate shortening in the QT interval in any patient after MgSO4. Magnesium can be given safely even in patients with acute myocardial infarction, angina pectoris or systemic hypertension, conditions in which isoproterenol is contraindicated; it can be applied faster than temporary cardiac pacing; and its use for TdP appears worthy of additional trials.

Abstract: Amiodarone hydrochloride, a new antiarrhythmic agent, has been associated with pulmonary toxicity characterized by cough, dyspnea and diffuse pulmonary infiltrates. We describe a case of fibrosing alveolitis, diagnosed by lung biopsy, in a patient receiving amiodarone which responded to corticosteroid therapy. The pulmonary symptoms recurred after discontinuing corticosteroids, five months after amiodarone was stopped, and were associated with a persistent amiodarone level. To our knowledge, this recurrence of amiodarone pulmonary toxicity has not been reported previously.

Abstract: Three patients are presented suffering from interstitial pneumonitis caused by amiodarone. Pulmonary Ga-67 uptake occurred in all three. There appeared to be a discrepancy between the scintigraphic and radiographic findings in two patients. Gallium-67 lung scintigraphy may offer an early, sensitive indicator for amiodarone pneumonitis.

Abstract: Four cases of amiodarone neuropathy are reported. Patients presented a sensorimotor neuropathy with distal predominance. Improvement occurred after drug discontinuation. Nerve conduction velocities were significantly decreased. Other secondary effects of amiodarone were noted in two cases. In one case serum levels of amiodarone and N-monodesethylamiodarone were evaluated during and after treatment. Pathological study of nerve with morphometric evaluation was performed. Axonal degeneration changes were predominant in 3 cases. Aspects of segmental demyelination and remyelination were noted in one case and related to secondary demyelination. Numerous lysosomal inclusions were present in Schwann cells, fibroblasts, capillary endothelial and perithelial cells and in perineural cells. Similar inclusions have been observed in other drug-induced lipidosis. The factors responsible for this neuropathy are unknown. In one case, amiodarone-induced hepatic failure might explain the persisting high serum levels of the drug.

Abstract: Three further patients are presented who developed evidence of a parenchymal pulmonary disturbance in the course of treatment with amiodarone. In one case the progress of the condition was rapid and ended fatally. Histological examination of the lungs showed evidence of diffuse alveolar damage. The concentration of amiodarone was from four to seven times higher in the lungs than in other organs studied. The concentration of the metabolite desethylamiodarone in the lungs was even higher in relation to other organs studied. The remaining two patients showed a more insidious onset and improvement after withdrawal of amiodarone and treatment with corticosteroids. Gallium 67 scintigraphy appeared to be a sensitive indicator of this adverse effect. Review of published reports revealed 35 cases of amiodarone pneumonitis, including the cases reported in this study. In 11 instances the dose of amiodarone was 400 mg or less. The onset was either insidious or rapidly progressive. Exertional dyspnoea was always present and a nonproductive cough, hypoxaemia, a raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate and diminished carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (transfer factor) were usually noted. Chest radiographs showed either a reticular pattern or diffuse patchy alveolar infiltrates. Discontinuation of amiodarone and an institution of corticosteroid treatment was usually followed by improvement or resolution.

Abstract: Interstitial pneumonitis developed in a patient who had received a cumulative dose of 985 g of amiodarone in nine years. No other cause for pneumonitis was found. The following findings favor an immunologic mechanism of hypersensitivity due to amiodarone: positive skin and basophil degranulation tests with amiodarone; lymphocytosis and inverted ratio of helper/suppressor T lymphocytes in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid; secretion of leukocyte inhibitory factor, as shown by the inhibition of migration of peripheral blood leukocytes; and positive lymphoblastic transformation in the presence of amiodarone.

Abstract: A case of diffuse interstitial pneumopathy which was observed by photonic microscopy and confirmed by electron microscopy is presented in a patient treated with amiodarone only. The iatrogenic origin of this pneumopathy appears certain as clinical and radiological signs improved after amiodarone treatment was withdrawn.

Abstract: A 3-week-old baby presented with recurrent supraventricular tachycardias unresponsive to medical treatment. Several DC shocks were required to terminate tachycardia. An abbreviated electrophysiological study was undertaken to determine the cause of the tachycardia. Rapid ventricular burst pacing successfully terminated repeated attacks of tachycardia until successful therapy with amiodarone was established. This patient demonstrates the value of pacemaker treatment of a resistant atrioventricular tachycardia in a neonate.

Abstract: Numerous cytoplasmic lamellar bodies were seen in many cell types in an open lung biopsy from a patient on amiodarone therapy. These membrane-bound lamellar bodies were characterized by distinct, concentric parallel membranes and peripheral granular densities. Their morphology and distribution suggest a metabolic disorder of phospholipid degradation induced by this drug. The differential diagnosis of lamellar body accumulation in the lung is discussed. This case emphasizes the desirability for ultrastructural study of lung biopsies in such potentially reversible lung disease.

Abstract: In a case of severe alveolitis and polyarthropathy occurring within two to five months of starting amiodarone treatment high plasma concentrations of immune complexes were found, suggesting a drug mediated hypersensitivity reaction. Initial symptomatic response followed high dosage corticosteroid and immunosuppressant treatment, but reduction in the dosage of corticosteroids was achieved only by successive plasma exchange with concomitant reduction in plasma concentrations of both amiodarone and immune complexes.

Abstract: Amiodarone (Cordarone) is an iodinated cardiac antiarrhythmic drug that causes a slate-gray discoloration of the sun-exposed skin and a yellow-brown stippling of the cornea. Histopathologically, biopsy specimens of aminodarone pigmentation sites disclose yellow-brown refractile granules in the reticular dermis. These granules were characterized by transmission electron microscopy as being concentrically arranged intralysosomal inclusions ("myelinlike" bodies) in dermal endothelial cells and perivascular smooth-muscle cells. Electron probe x-ray analysis of these same inclusions disclosed definite peaks for iodine, evidence for the presence of amiodarone or a metabolite of the drug at these sites. Amiodarone, then, concentrates in lysosomes and causes an accumulation of lipids similar to what has been seen with other cationic amphiphilic compounds, such as the glycosphingolipid stored in Fabry's disease. Amiodarone must be recognized as a cause of a drug-induced lipid storage disease with cutaneous and corneal manifestations.

Abstract: Amiodarone, an iodinated benzofuran derivative, has electrophysiologic effects on cardiac muscle akin to those of hypothyroidism. It is possible that the drug exerts its salutary effect, at least in part, by selectively inhibiting the action of triiodothyronine (T3) on the myocardium. The drug produces complex changes in thyroid hormones, with significant elevations in thyroxine (T4) and reverse T3 (rT3), with minor decreases in T3, and with minor and transient increases in thyroid-stimulating hormone, but without effect on thyroid-binding globulin. These changes may interfere with the biochemical evaluation of thyroid function. Rarely, hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism may develop during the course of amiodarone therapy, a complication caused by the iodine contained in the drug rather than by the direct pharmacologic actions of the compound. The incidence of altered thyroid function induced is likely to vary with populations susceptible to iodine-induced goiter. Under the action of amiodarone, serum rT3 levels increase as a function of dose and duration of therapy and therefore provide a basis for judging the magnitude of in vivo drug cumulation. It was found that therapeutic efficacy was usually predictable on the basis of the attainment of a defined range of serum values, established by a correlation of rT3 levels with therapeutic responses both during loading and maintenance phases as well as after withdrawal of treatment of steady-state drug effects. Serious adverse effects occurred nearly always in association with four- to fivefold increases of rT3 above baseline values, and disappeared when such levels fell as a result of dosage reduction or after temporary drug discontinuation. The data suggest that the determination of serum rT3 levels during amiodarone therapy provides a simple and reliable technique for monitoring the drug's antiarrhythmic efficacy and toxicity, thereby enhancing its clinical utility. The use of rT3 levels may permit the development of a safe but optimal therapeutic regimen for the control of a wide spectrum of refractory atrial and ventricular tachyarrhythmias. The use of this technique, however, presupposes the allowance that must be made for variations in the methods for the serum assay of rT3 and of the systemic conditions in which the rT3 levels fluctuate relative to severity of the illness.

Abstract: Of the side effects that complicate amiodarone therapy, pulmonary fibrosis is potentially the most serious. Therefore, the development of techniques to predict the onset of this troublesome reaction would be of great practical value. Reports of 39 patients who developed pulmonary toxicity with amiodarone were evaluated for clues to precipitating factors and information on the response to corticosteroid treatment. The majority of patients were being given maintenance doses greater than 400 mg/day. Patients appeared to improve after withdrawal of amiodarone, both with and without corticosteroid treatment. In addition, a case report is presented of a patient who developed pulmonary changes that disappeared when amiodarone was withdrawn and did not recur when amiodarone was reinstituted. Data from sequential pulmonary function tests and cumulative amiodarone dosage in 35 patients were also examined to determine their value in predicting pulmonary complications. Pulmonary function tests did not appear to be useful in predicting the likelihood of an individual patient's developing pulmonary complications. Although none of the available information identifies the mechanism mediating amiodarone pulmonary toxicity, the frequency of the complication probably can be reduced by timely reductions in maintenance dosage.

Abstract: A patient with sustained ventricular tachycardia was operated on after an unsuccessful trial of amiodarone. Profound myocardial depression and low cardiac output became evident as he was weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass. Despite inotropic support, use of the intra-aortic balloon pump and left heart assist device, he died. Because of this experience, the authors developed a canine model to determine the effects on left ventricular function of amiodarone given orally. Left ventricular stroke work, cardiac output, ventricular contractility (maximum dP/dt) and peripheral vascular resistance were measured in 12 mongrel dogs at a heart rate of 150 beats/min and at a constant preload of 10 mm Hg. Six animals received the drug orally and the remaining animals were used as sham-operated controls. Maximum dP/dt decreased from 2855 mm Hg/s to 1291 mm Hg/s (p less than 0.01) and left ventricular stroke work was reduced from 48.7 g-m/beat to 21.8 g-m/beat (p less than 0.05) after the administration of amiodarone. Cardiac output and peripheral vascular resistance did not differ significantly. Amiodarone severely depressed left ventricular function in this experiment. The prolonged half-life of this antiarrhythmic combined with its adverse effect on myocardial function suggests that it should not be used in patients with refractory life-threatening ventricular tachycardia who are good candidates for electrophysiologic evaluation and endocardial resection.

Abstract: Two patients in chronic renal failure receiving amiodarone for the treatment of refractory arrhythmias were commenced on dialysis, in one case, intermittent peritoneal dialysis, in the other, haemodialysis. Plasma concentrations of amiodarone and its desethyl metabolite were consistent with the dose received, whilst neither compound was recovered in the dialysate. In these patients and in 10 additional patients with normal renal function taking amiodarone, only negligible amounts of either compound were detected in urine. These findings suggest that amiodarone may be a suitable antiarrhythmic agent for use in patients with chronic renal failure.

Abstract: Amiodarone is an effective antiarrhythmic that has been used in Europe for over a decade and has been available for investigational use in North America for a shorter time. It has several well recognized side effects. Recent reports have related pulmonary disorders to the use of this drug; fibrosing alveolitis has been found by lung biopsy. Amiodarone's toxicity to the lung does not appear to be dose-related. Besides cessation of amiodarone administration, management of this complication includes steroid therapy. A case is described of nonspecific diffuse alveolar damage syndrome in a patient who had received amiodarone.

Abstract: Amiodarone hydrochloride, used for prophylaxis of recurrent ventricular tachyarrhythmias that are resistant to other agents, may cause toxic pulmonary reactions associated with abnormal chest radiographs. The authors review four new cases of amiodarone-induced toxicity and eight cases reported in the literature. Peripheral areas of consolidation, predominantly in the upper lobes and resembling chronic eosinophilic pneumonia or tuberculosis, and diffuse interstitial disease were seen. Clinical symptoms included dyspnea on exertion, weakness, and occasionally pleuritic pain. Radiographic abnormalities developed after a median latency period of six months on the drug (600 to 800 mg daily). Pathologic findings suggested a possible toxic effect of the drug on phospholipid metabolism in the lung. Amiodarone toxicity may lead to significant pulmonary insufficiency. The clinical symptoms and radiographic abnormalities were completely reversible upon cessation of drug use and institution of corticosteroid treatment. Resolution generally occurs within three months.

Abstract: Amiodarone is an investigative antiarrhythmic drug in the United States. However, it has been used successfully in European countries for the past 14 years. Amiodarone is effective in the long-term management of resistant supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias. Although a very useful addition to the antiarrhythmic drugs currently in use, it has potential side effects that have delayed its acceptance by the Food and Drug Administration. The consensus of opinion among the clinical investigators of amiodarone is that it will be released for limited clinical use in the near future. Cardiovascular nurses involved in the design, coordination, and conduction of clinical investigations need to be vigilant in objectively monitoring and documenting both the potential efficacy and possible adverse effects of all interventions in research subjects.

Abstract: A patient with types A and B of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome developed subacute pneumonitis during long-term treatment with amiodarone. The pneumopathy occurred only when the maintenance dose was increased to 800 mg/day. Lung specimens obtained by transbronchial biopsy showed chronic pneumonitis with C3 deposition by immunofluorescence. Pulmonary signs spontaneously disappeared two months after the drug was discontinued.

Abstract: 4 children, ages 11-14 years, were diagnosed as having primary ventricular arrhythmias (3 ventricular tachycardia, 1 multifocal premature ventricular contractions) without underlying heart disease. All 4 patients were treated initially with standard antiarrhythmic drugs (quinidine, propranolol, procainamide) and either did not respond (3 patients) or experienced drug toxicity (quinidine - 1 patient) necessitating withdrawal of antiarrhythmic therapy. Amiodarone, a new antiarrhythmic agent, was initiated in a single oral daily dose of 10 mg/kg/day. All patients have shown a significant clinical response to oral amiodarone with either complete suppression of ventricular tachycardia in 2 patients, near complete suppression in 1 and abolition of multifocal premature ventricular contractions in the fourth patients. 2 patients have had corneal microdeposits detected by slitlamp examination and are receiving methylcellulose eye drops; no other adverse reactions have been encountered during the follow-up of 6 months to 3 years.

Abstract: Five cases of amiodarone-induced polymorphous ventricular tachycardia (torsade de pointes) are presented. All patients had recurrent syncope or dizziness due to polymorphous ventricular tachycardia and in all cases the QT interval was prolonged. In two cases hypokalemia was present at the time the arrhythmia was first recorded, but in both cases polymorphous ventricular tachycardia persisted despite correction of the electrolyte imbalance. Standard treatment for polymorphous ventricular tachycardia (isoproterenol, ventricular pacing, or both) was successful in all patients, however, therapy had to be continued for 5 to 10 days, most probably because of the long elimination half-life of amiodarone.

Abstract: Pulmonary toxicity may occur in association with amiodarone hydrochloride therapy. The clinical features of the pulmonary involvement are mild dyspnea, leukocytosis, hypoxemia, elevation in the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and restrictive changes on pulmonary function testing. Diffuse interstitial and patchy peripheral alveolar infiltrates, which may frequently involve the upper lobes, characterize the radiologic findings. Accumulation of foamy macrophages in alveolar spaces, hyperplasia of type II pneumocytes, and widening of alveolar septae are noted histologically. Ultrastructural examination shows granular and lamellar membranous structures within distended lysosomes. With cessation of amiodarone therapy and treatment with corticosteroids, clinical symptoms and radiographic abnormalities resolve. The time interval for resolution of radiographic changes appears to be greater than 2 months. The precise role of corticosteroid therapy remains unknown in light of pathologic findings suggesting a metabolic rather than immunologic basis for the toxicity.

Abstract: Amiodarone has proved to be a valuable drug in atrial fibrillation associated with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. When it was administered to a patient with this syndrome in atrial fibrillation, who had previously suffered an inferior myocardial infarction, the ventricular rate accelerated from 170 to 230 beats/minute.This unusual case emphasises the need for full electrophysiological assessment of patients with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome for whom amiodarone treatment is being considered.

Abstract: A case with Type A Wolff-Parkinson-White pattern and recurrent sustained ventricular tachycardia is presented. Because of ventricular pre-excitation, electrocardiographic clues suggestive of ventricular tachycardia were ignored and the diagnosis of supraventricular tachycardia with conduction to the ventricles over the accessory pathway was made during each admission to the hospital. Ventricular tachycardia was suspected only when programmed stimulation studies performed twelve years after initial presentation and many hospitalizations failed to induce a tachycardia with a QRS pattern similar to that of spontaneously occurring tachycardia. The diagnosis of ventricular tachycardia was later confirmed by intracardiac recordings made during a spontaneous episode of tachycardia. Tachycardia was unresponsive to all conventional antiarrhythmic agents but was controlled with amiodarone. The differential diagnosis of wide QRS complex tachycardia in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, the implications of correctly diagnosing the tachycardia, and the usefulness of intracardiac electrophysiologic studies in differentiating supraventricular tachycardia with aberrant conduction from ventricular tachycardia are discussed.

Abstract: Electrophysiologic studies were performed in a patient with recurrent supraventricular tachyarrhythmias. Sinus and paced atrial beats had QRS complexes characteristic of atrioventricular (A-V) conduction through a manifest left lateral accessory pathway (Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, type A). Three distinct types of A-V reciprocating tachycardia and three different modes of retrograde atrial activation were demonstrated. Type 1 tachycardia involved the slow A-V nodal pathway and a second (left lateral or left paraseptal) accessory A-V pathway capable of retrograde conduction only. Type 2 tachycardia was of the slow-fast A-V nodal pathway type. Type 3 tachycardia involved in heretofore undescribed circuit in that retrograde conduction occurred through an accessory A-V pathway with long retrograde conduction times and anterograde conduction through both the manifest left lateral accessory A-V pathway and fast A-V nodal pathway. Premature ventricular beats delivered late in the cycle of this tachycardia advanced (but did not change) the retrograde atrial activity without affecting the timing of the corresponding anterograde H deflection. In summary, this patient had five (three accessory and two intranodal) pathways participating in three different types of A-V reciprocating tachycardia; the recurrence of these were prevented with oral amiodarone therapy.

Abstract: A case is presented of a reversible intra-Hisian block occurring under amiodarone treatment for atrial tachycardia in a patient without clear intraventricular conduction abnormalities. His bundle recordings showed an atrial tachycardia with intermittent exit block and greatly prolonged BH and HV intervals (40 and 100 msec, respectively). Thirty days after amiodarone discontinuation, His bundle electrograms showed atrial flutter without intra-Hisian or infra-Hisian delay. Amiodarone should be used with caution during long-term oral therapy in patients with or without clear intraventricular conduction defects.

Abstract: The potentiation of the anticoagulant effect of sodium warfarin by amiodarone is reported in 10 patients. Amiodarone appears to augment the depression of vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors caused by warfarin by an uncertain mechanism, and may lead to serious bleeding. The maintenance dose of warfarin should be halved when amiodarone and warfarin are prescribed together.

Abstract: Six patients are presented who developed pulmonary infiltrates of undetermined origin while being treated for severe ventricular arrhythmias with amiodarone hydrochloride. Biopsy material was available in four patients and revealed interstitial or alveolar fibrosis and pneumonitis. Four patients recovered and two died of severe cardiopulmonary decompensation; all of the patients who recovered received corticosteroid therapy. Pulmonary fibrosis is a previously unreported complication of amiodarone therapy.

Abstract: A 44-year-old woman is described in whom amiodarone, disopyramide, and quinidine, administered alone separately, induced atypical ventricular tachycardia (AVT, torsade de pointes). Following a closed mitral valvotomy, she received quinidine, 1.2 g/day, without interruption for 17 years. Because of a recurrence of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, the dose of the drug was increased to 1.4 g/day; 24 hours later AVT with syncope developed but responded promptly to atropine. Two years later, 24 hours following an increase in the dose of disopyramide from 300 to 600 mg/day, AVT with syncope occurred; isoproterenol abolished the arrhythmia instantly. Amiodarone was the third drug to induce AVT in this patient; she received 200 mg/day six days per week for six months. The dose was subsequently increased to 200 and 400 mg/day on alternate days, six days per week, and two months later AVT occurred. That time the only effective treatment was ventricular pacing.

Abstract: A high-performance liquid chromatographic technique is described for the measurement of amiodarone and its desethyl metabolite in plasma. Preliminary observations are presented on the concentrations of metabolite found during the early stages of chronic amiodarone therapy. A case history is outlined in which noncompliance during treatment with amiodarone was confirmed by measurement of the ratio of desethylamiodarone to amiodarone concentrations.

Abstract: In three patients with vasospastic angina pectoris, chronic amiodarone administered orally at doses of 800 and 1,000 mg/day totally suppressed spontaneous episodes of ischemic chest pain for 8 to 14 months. Before treatment, ergonovine maleate 0.2 to 0.4 mg intravenously provoked chest pain and similar ischemic ECG changes as those occurring spontaneously. During amiodarone treatment ergonovine vasoconstriction was totally or partially inhibited. In addition to calcium-blocking agents, amiodarone is another spasmolytic drug which effects smooth muscle relaxation by different mechanisms and appears to be useful for the chronic treatment and prevention of variant angina. The vasodilator property of amiodarone is achieved by both direct action and noncompetitive alpha receptor antagonism of coronary vasculature.

Abstract: Programmed electrical stimulation of the heart was performed in a 47 year old man with prior myocardial infarction and recurrent sustained ventricular tachycardia that was refractory to standard medical therapy. The tachycardia could be provoked by regular atrial pacing at a rate of 100/min, regular ventricular pacing at the same rate and regular atrial pacing at a rate of 200/min in the presence of 2:1 atrioventricular block. All three techniques resulted in an interval of approximately 600 ms between successive ventricular depolarizations. Single interpolated ventricular premature depolarizations delivered during sinus rhythm were followed by a postextrasystolic conducted sinus beat that initiated ventricular tachycardia. However, when the same interpolated ventricular premature depolarization was followed by a ventricular fusion beat no tachycardia ensued. This study therefore emphasizes the importance of hart rate and pattern of ventricular activation in determining whether ventricular tachycardia can be provoked by programmed electrical stimulation of the heart.

Abstract: A 63-year-old man with sarcoidosis developed recurrent ventricular tachyarrhythmias, intermittent heart block and congestive cardiac failure. Transvenous endomyocardial biopsy demonstrated sarcoid infiltration of the myocardium. Ventricular tachyarrhythmias were abolished with amiodarone and prednisone.

Abstract: Recurrent ventricular tachycardia (torsade de pointes) is a serious and sometimes fatal arrhythmia occurring usually with quinidine therapy. Four patients experienced ventricular tachycardia after receiving conventional doses of disopyramide phosphate (600 mg/day) for recurrent atrial fibrillation-two of them in combination with amiodarone hydrochloride. Isoproterenol hydrochloride infusion was effective in three patients, while ventricular pacing promptly abolished ventricular ectopic beats and the ventricular tachycardia in the fourth patient. Torsade de pointes is more likely to occur in patients with severe repolarization delay and sinus bradycardia or atrioventricular block, and its appearance in four patients within a period of nine months after the introduction of disopyramide treatment in our service raises the possibility that this is not a rare complication of this drug, especially if used in combination with other QT interval-prolonging agents.

Abstract: A 49 year old man had severe refractory Prinzmetal's variant angina and angiographically documented coronary arterial spasm of a dominant circumflex artery. The spasm was provoked by methergine (an ergot alkaloid) and seemed resistant to various forms of medical therapy including administration of nitrates, nifedipine, verapamil, diltiazem and amiodarone. The attacks of angina at rest persisted at the rate of 7 to 15/day and were frequently associated with atrioventricular (A-V) block. After unsuccessful plexectomy performed in another institution, the patient underwent complete cardiac denervation (produced by autotransplantation). The follow-up data have interesting implications in relation to treatment of refractory variant angina, as well as possible mechanisms of coronary arterial spasm.

Abstract: 3 patients with atrial fibrillation, of varying origin, have been successfully converted to sinus rhythm by D.C. shock while on the antiarrhythmic drug amiodarone. D.C. shock did not cause rhythm disturbance. D.C. conversion may not be contraindicated in patients taking amiodarone.

Abstract: A 28-year-old male with recurrent episodes of ventricular fibrillation, which were initiated by very early ventricular premature depolarizations with a normal QT interval, was subjected to three consecutive electrophysiological studies. During the first study, which was carried out to test the efficacy of amiodarone treatment, no ventricular arrhythmias could be induced. While on amiodarone therapy, the patient experienced another syncopal episode and therefore a second electrophysiological study was done. In that study, ventricular fibrillation was induced by ventricular stimulation. During the third study, which was carried out in order to evaluate the effect of the addition of quinidine to the on-going amiodarone therapy, no more than three repetitive ventricular responses could be induced. The patient has been asymptomatic since the third study (fifteen months) with combined therapy of amiodarone and quinidine. The significance of the ability to induce ventricular fibrillation during an electrophysiological study is discussed as well as the value of such studies in determining the long-term efficacy of antiarrhythmic drug therapy.

Abstract: Amiodarone is used in the treatment of previously drug-resistant supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias. We report our experience with amiodarone in 8 patients. Five patients had paroxysmal atrial flutter, one had paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, one had supraventricular tachycardia, and one ventricular tachycardia. Considerable improvement, both objectively and subjectively, was observed in all patients. Side effects were as follows: all patients had corneal microdeposits, one developed left bundle branch block which resolved on stopping amiodarone, and one reported constipation and abdominal pains. Six patients have been treated for 10-28 months; 3 developed tolerance at 4-14 months after the introduction of amiodarone therapy, but symptoms improved with increased dosage. It is important to watch for the development of tolerance to this drug.

Abstract: Hyperthyroidism is a rare side effect of amiodarone treatment. Four patients with this untoward effect are described One patient with mild hyperthyroidism before treatment with amiodarone, developed prolonged severe resistant thyrotoxicosis 6 months after initiation of this drug. A second patient with Wolf-Parkinson-White syndrome and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation was successfully stabilized with amiodarone for 18 months. However, the arrhythmia recurred and the thyroid function tests were found to be elevated. In 2 other patients only slight elevation of the thyroid function tests were found without clinical manifestations 4 months after treatment with amiodarone had been initiated.

Abstract: A 25 year old man had experienced virtually incessant ventricular tachycardia since the age of 16 years, and complained of increasing lethargy and shortness of breath over the past 5 years. Despite medical therapy with numerous conventional antiarrhythmic agents, no single drug or combination of drugs had successfully controlled the tachycardia. Isotope and contrast angiography revealed an enlarged left ventricle with poor function. Electrophysiological studies demonstrate earliest endocardial activation at the left ventricular apex. No electrical procedure terminated tachycardia. Following institution of amiodarone, continuous ECG monitoring revealed periods of sinus rhythm alternating with periods of ventricular bigeminy. Repeat isotope angiography indicated a considerable improvement in L.V. function. There was a corresponding reduction in heart size on the chest radiograph. Clinical improvement was evidenced by disappearance of lethargy and shortness of breath. This report demonstrates that amiodarone, a new antiarrhythmic agent, may suppress long standing incessant ventricular tachycardia resistant to other antiarrhythmic agents. The marked reduction in heart size on amiodarone may suggest that the associated cardiomegaly is secondary to tachycardia.

Abstract: Amiodarone, 600 mg orally daily, was used in an attempt to control supraventricular tachyarrhythmias in a patient with the sick sinus syndrome. Twenty days from the onset of therapy the Q-T interval lengthened. Episodes of ventricular flutter, ventricular fibrillation and self-terminating ventricular tachyarrhythmia (torsade de pointes) developed on the 28th day of amiodarone therapy. Temporary cardiac pacing prevented further episodes of ventricular fibrillation. Despite the suggestion that this drug may be given in large doses for long periods of time since it has a wide safety margin, we feel that the risk of lethal arrhythmias is such that caution is required in its use.

Abstract: 6 cardiac patients were found to present various degrees of corneal involvement following systemic treatment with amiodarone. The clinical pattern of the keratopathy, its benign course and the pathophysiology are discussed. Lacrimal insufficiency or incomplete blinking seem to contribute to the severity of the keratopathy.

Abstract: Amiodarone hydrochloride was used to treat 19 patients with symptomatic arrhythmias refractory to quinidine sulfate, procainamide hydrochloride, disopyramide phosphate, antazoline hydrochloride, lidocaine hydrochloride, bretylium tosylate, propranolol hydrochloride, phenytoin sodium, and practotol acetanilide given to the limit of tolerance. In 17 patients, attacks were completely controlled. Arrhythmias treated successfully included recurrent supraventricular tachycardias, recurrent supraventricular tachycardias with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, and refractory ventricular arrhythmias including recurrent ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation complicating acute coronary heart disease. Control was confirmed by continuous ECG monitoring both in the hospital and when ambulatory and was maintained for up to four years. Attacks of supraventricular tachycardia were reduced from 7.9/mo to one attack every 53.5 months on amiodarone. Hospital admissions for arrhythmias were reduced from 34 the year before treatment to none the year after. Therefore, amiodarone is an excellent drug for control of many refractory arrhythmias, but two patients with recurrent atrial fibrillation were refractory to this treatment.

Abstract: An automatic dual-demand pacemaker has been used in six patients to treat refractory attacks of paroxysmal re-entry atrioventricular tachycardia that occurred in the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. The pacemaker was designed to pace at a fixed rate of 70 beats per minute when sensed heart rates were either below this rate or above 150 beats per minute; in the latter case, it would compete with the paroxysmal tachycardia and interrupt it after a short period of random scaning. The best location for the permanent pacing electrode and the feasibility of using the pacemaker were tested in each case during a detailed preliminary intracardiac electrophysiological study. The permanent pacing electrode was positioned in the coronary sinus in three patients and was attached to the epicardium of either the left or right ventricle in another three. All patients were given regular oral doses of verapamil or propranolol to enhance the effectiveness of the pacemaker system and, with the latter, to prevent pacemaker activation during sinus tachycardia. Over a follow-up period of between 11 and 47 months, the pacemaker system remained completely effective in three patients, but developed unreliable sensing in another two (one coronary sinus and one left ventricular lead). In the sixth patient the pacemaker was only effective when the rate of the tachycardia remained below 170 beats a minute, as when she was resting supine; when sitting or standing, however, her tachycardia rate considerably exceeded this value and the pacemaker was ineffective. Explantation of the pacemaker and either successful cryosurgical ablation of the accesory AV pathway or treatment with amiodarone was undertaken in the three patients in whom the pacemaker had failed.

Abstract: Clinical, electrophysiological, and the nerve and muscle biopsy findings from a case treated with amiodarone are reported. Marked distal motor and sensory impairment and distal muscular atrophy were observed clinically. The electrophysiological examination revealed normal motor and sensory conduction velocities in the median nerve; the sensory action  potentials were polyphasic and reduced in amplitude. Electromyography revealed denervation potentials and severe loss of motor units in the M. extensor digitorum brevis and in the M. tibialis anterior. The light and electronmicroscopical study of a N. suralis biopsy displayed total loss of large myelinated fibers and an almost total reduction of small myelinated fibers. The number of unmyelinated axons was markedly reduced. Fibrocytes and degenerative axons polymorphous inclusion bodies were present in Schwann cells. The muscle biopsy revealed both neurogenic and myopathic changes. Lipid storage was also present in the muscle fibers. Physical and chemical analysis of the nerve and muscle biopsy revealed the content of iodine to be more than 40 times increased. The findings indicate damage of axons, schwann cells and muscle fibers. It is suggested that the lipid storage in nerve and muscle tissue might be related to the accumulation of the drug or its metabolites.

Abstract: Five patients with the bradycardia-tachycardia syndrome have been treated successfully with the antiarrhythmic agent amiodarone. Three patients were treated for over nine months and one of these patients had corneal micro deposits. One patient had to be taken off the drug because of side effects. Amiodarone should be tried in patients suffering from the bradycardia-tachycardia syndrome before resorting to cardiac pacing.

Abstract: A patient with an acute anterior wall myocardial infarction complicated by bilateral bundle branch block and paroxysmal AV block is presented. The following new, uncommon or unreported phenomena were documented: the simultaneous occurrence of phase-3 block in the right bundle branch and phase-4 block in the left bundle branch; the simultaneous occurrence of phase-4 block in both main bundle branches; phase-4 left posterior hemiblock associated with escape beats arising from the injured posterior division of the left bundle branch; supernormal conduction in the right bundle branck and 2:1 right bundle branch block related to supernormality. Most of these changes were, of course, not simultaneous, and their successive appearance was related to day-to-day and sometimes hour-to-hour variations in the degree and quality of the multifascicular injury caused by the infarct. In addition, the actions of several drugs upon automaticity and conduction were tested. The effects of amiodarone, lidocaine and isoproterenol were similar to those previously reported under comparable circumstances. At a moment when the patient had repeated episodes of paroxysmal AV block with severe Adams-Stokes seizures, the administration of a single i.v. dose of 0.25 mg of strophanthin suppressed totally the Adams-Stokes attacks through a significant enhancement of ventricular automaticity. If rapid implantation of an artifical pacemaker is not at hand, strophanthin may be life-saving in patients with acute paroxysmal AV block.
