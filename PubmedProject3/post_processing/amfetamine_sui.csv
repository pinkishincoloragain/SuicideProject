Abstract: Tranylcypromine is an effective antidepressant from the class of monoamine oxidase inhibitors and is structurally related to amphetamine. However, reports differ regarding the potential metabolism of tranylcypromine to amphetamine and methamphetamine within the human body. We report a 25-year-old woman with severe depression who died due to a fatal tranylcypromine overdose in 2016. She had been prescribed tranylcypromine one day previously and had no history of previous suicide attempts or substance abuse. The body was transferred to a forensic medicine department in Tehran, Iran for the autopsy. A urine sample was positive for tranylcypromine, amphetamine and methamphetamine using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry after derivatisation with heptafluorobutyric acid. As amphetamines were present in the urine sample, it was assumed that the tranylcypromine had been converted to amphetamines metabolically. As such, it is possible that the legitimate use of certain prescription drugs may complicate the interpretation of test results for illegal drugs.

Abstract: Stimulant medications are used in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and serious cardiac complications can occur when these medications are abused. We present a 15-year-old adolescent girl who was found to have a Takotsubo cardiomyopathy after acute amphetamine/dextroamphetamine ingestion.

Abstract: In this report, a unique and bizarre case of complicated suicide is presented. The decedent was found dead in the basin of a porta-potty, wearing women's pantyhose, jewelry, and makeup. The initial investigation was suspect for homicide. Although an autoerotic accidental death cannot be excluded, the patient's medical history and autopsy results provided evidence for suicide, including several substances positive in his serum. Tramadol was quantified to be 140 mg/L, approximately 470 times the therapeutic range. Moreover, formaldehyde was also present, presumably absorbed from the contents of the chemical toilet. An exhaustive search could not reveal similar circumstances of suicide in a porta-potty or with the levels of tramadol found in the decedent.

Abstract: In this study, we measured the urine concentrations of methamphetamine and amphetamine as metabolites of selegiline after ingestion of an overdose of selegiline. A patient who had developed Parkinson disease took selegiline in a suicide attempt. Analysis by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) with trifluoroacetic acid-derivatization revealed the presence of methamphetamine and amphetamine in the patient's urine at concentrations of 0.62 microg/ml and 0.25 microg/ml, respectively. To determine the stereospecificity of the methamphetamine and amphetamine, a urine sample was analyzed by GC-MS after derivatization with N-(trifluoroacetyl)-l-prolyl chloride. The methamphetamine and amphetamine were levorotatory in form. The ratio of the methamphetamine to amphetamine concentration in the urine was 2.5. This value is consistent with other case reports of ingestion of selegiline, which suggests that the methamphetamine to amphetamine concentration ratio in urine is useful information for indicating use of selegiline.

Abstract: Necrophagous insects may provide useful information about the time, place and cause of death. In addition, they can serve as reliable alternative specimens for toxicological analysis in cases where human tissue and fluids, normally taken during autopsies, are not available, due to decomposition of the corpse. This paper reports the results of drug analysis of the larvae of two fly families, Calliphoridae and Sarcophagidae, collected from the body of a middle-aged man who had committed suicide approximately three weeks before his corpse was found. Multiple samples of decomposed human tissue, of the blowfly, and of the larval flesh were analysed using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS), and amphetamine was detected in all samples. While the screening results were beyond doubt, the quantitative analysis was less clear, and further research is needed in this area.

Abstract: A simple and sensitive method for the simultaneous analysis of fenfluramine, amphetamine and methamphetamine in whole blood was developed using a headspace-solid phase microextraction (SPME) and derivatization. A 0.5 g whole blood sample, 5 microl d(5)-methamphetamine (50 micrig/ml) as an internal standard, and 0.5 ml sodium hydroxide (1 M) were placed into a 12 ml vial, and sealed rapidly with a silicone septum and an aluminum cap. Immediately after the vial was heated to 70 degrees C in an aluminium block heater, the needle of the SPME device was inserted through the septum of the vial, and the extraction fiber was exposed in the headspace for 15 min. First, heptafluorobutyric anhydride was injected into the injection port of the GC-MS, and the compounds extracted by the fiber were then desorbed and derivatized simultaneously by exposing the fiber in the injection port. The calibration curves, using an internal standard method, demonstrated good linearity throughout the concentration range from 0.01 to 1.0 microg/g. The detection limits of this method were 5.0 ng/g for fenfluramine and methamphetamine, and 10 ng/g for amphetamine. No interferences were found, and the time for analysis was about 30 min for one sample. This method was applied to a suicide case in which the victim ingested fenfluramine. Fenfluramine was detected in the blood sample collected from the victim at the concentration of 7.7 microg/g.

Abstract: During a 16-month period, nine fatalities occurred among white male drug-addicts, where fentanyl was detected at postmortem toxicological analysis. The street samples associated with these cases confirmed the presence of fentanyl as an additive in low-concentration amphetamine powders with caffeine, phenazone and sugar as cutting agents. In seven of the cases, an acute intoxication by fentanyl was considered to be the immediate cause of death, and in one case, it was likely, but no analysis of fentanyl was performed in blood, and in another case the death was suicide by hanging. This appears to be the first report of a cluster of fentanyl-related deaths outside the United States, and the occurrence of fentanyl in combination with amphetamine has not previously been reported. In addition, in all cases, femoral blood was collected, and samples were handled and analysed according to standardized, quality-controlled procedures. The previous history, circumstances surrounding the death, autopsy findings, histology and toxicology examination of each case are presented. The gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric method for fentanyl is also described. Fentanyl concentrations ranged from 0.5 to 17 ng g-1 blood, and from 5 to 160 ng ml-1 urine. Other drugs found were amphetamine (8 cases), ethanol (5 cases) and benzodiazepines (5 cases). Morphine was found in only one case. The average age of men was 33.9 years (range 22-44); six were found in their own of friend's apartment, two inside buildings (stairways) and one was found outdoors. We conclude that fentanyl is a dangerous substance that should be considered in drug-addict deaths even outside the United States, particularly when the remaining toxicology is unremarkable, and the cause of death cannot be ascertained

Abstract: Specimens that tested positive for amphetamines by immunoassay were confirmed by mass spectrometry. The absence of detectable d-amphetamine (limit of detection at 50 ng/mL) with a positive methamphetamine prompted further testing by chiral derivatization. This data demonstrates that d-amphetamine need not be present in methamphetamine positive cases.

Abstract: Amphetamine abuse is widespread and is frequently encountered in general hospital settings. We have recently seen amphetamine-induced transient psychosis associated with severe self-injurious behavior and self-mutilation. In the setting of bizarre and/or severe self-injurious behavior, screening for amphetamines is indicated.

Abstract: Selegiline is a relatively new antiparkinson's drug whose metabolites include methamphetamine and amphetamine. A 72-year-old female with apparently suicidal intentions was found dead at her residence. The cause of death was listed as coronary heart disease with a history of polypharmacy. The tissue methamphetamine and amphetamine concentrations resulting from selegiline administration are presented in this report.

Abstract: Substance abuse among the mentally ill has become increasingly prominent. This article describes the problems presented by dual diagnosis patients in the urban, publicly funded, psychiatric emergency room. When such patients become acutely ill, neither the public health system nor the mental health clinician is adequately prepared to provide care. The inability to effectively treat these patients has become strikingly clear in recent years. In 1986, the Psychiatric Emergency Service at San Francisco General Hospital began to overflow with patients who required overnight stays. The intoxicated substance abusers with acute psychiatric complaints were the most difficult to manage clinically and administratively. Suggestions are offered for innovative approaches to this group of public patients: dual training of clinicians, flexible treatment programs prepared to deal with the whole person, and public funding that reflects patients' needs rather than clinicians' preferences.

Abstract: A case of tranylcypromine overdose is reported. Tranylcypromine, amphetamine methamphetamine and phenylethylamine were detected in the plasma by gas chromatography and their identity confirmed by mass spectrometry. The data suggested that the amphetamines were metabolic products of tranylcypromine. Platelet monoamine oxidase activity was more than 95% inhibited during the 72 h after the overdose despite complete clinical recovery by that time. The possible role of amphetamines and phenylethylamine in causing the clinical manifestations of tranylcypromine overdose is discussed.
