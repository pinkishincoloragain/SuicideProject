Electroencephalogram indicated a brain lesion which was confirmed by a brain scan and angiogram. The hypercalcemia persisted after removal of the meningioma and serum levels of calcium returned to normal only after a parathyroid adenoma was removed during an additional intervention. This association of meningioma with hyperparathyroidism is unique in the literature. The difficulties of diagnosis resulting from the neuropsychiatric symptoms common to the two disorders are discussed.drugs['calcium']titleMeningioma associated with parathyroid adenoma.DOI10.1097/00000441-197611000-00009date1976-11-01PMIDa['1015512']filters['case reports']sentences[{'ID': 's1053', 'sent': 'A woman hospitalized because of attempted suicide with diazepam tablets was found to have hypercalcemia and other signs of hyperparathyroidism.', 'is_suicidal': '', 'ADE': '', 'drugs': [], 'sui_keywords': ['suicid']}, {'ID': 's1054', 'sent': 'Electroencephalogram indicated a brain lesion which was confirmed by a brain scan and angiogram.', 'is_suicidal': '', 'ADE': '', 'drugs': []}, {'ID': 's1055', 'sent': 'The hypercalcemia persisted after removal of the meningioma and serum levels of calcium returned to normal only after a parathyroid adenoma was removed during an additional intervention.', 'is_suicidal': '', 'ADE': '', 'drugs': ['calcium']}, {'ID': 's1056', 'sent': 'This association of meningioma with hyperparathyroidism is unique in the literature.', 'is_suicidal': '', 'ADE': '', 'drugs': []}, {'ID': 's1057', 'sent': 'The difficulties of diagnosis resulting from the neuropsychiatric symptoms common to the two disorders are discussed.', 'is_suicidal': '', 'ADE': '', 'drugs': []}]abstractA woman hospitalized because of attempted suicide with diazepam tablets was found to have hypercalcemia and other signs of hyperparathyroidism.
