['Multimodal analgesia protocols have been implemented after elective surgery to reduce opioid use, however there is limited data on utility after polytrauma. Therefore, we investigated the impact of a multimodal analgesia\xa0protocol on\xa0inpatient and post-discharge outpatient opioid use after polytrauma.\nA retrospective review of patients admitted to a Level I trauma center between September 2017-February 2018 (prior to multimodal protocol; "pre-cohort") and October 2018-April 2019 (after multimodal protocol; "post-cohort") was performed. An outpatient controlled substance registry was utilized to capture morphine milligram equivalents (MME) and gabapentin dispensed in the 6 mo after injury.\n620 patients were included (295 pre-cohort, 325 post-cohort). Total inpatient MME decreased from 177.5 mg-130 mg (P= 0.01) between the cohorts. Daily inpatient MME decreased from 70.8 mg-44.7 mg (P< 0.01). Intravenous hydromorphone decreased from 2 mg in the pre-cohort to 1 mg in the post-cohort (P= 0.02). Inpatient oxycodone decreased from 45 mg-30 mg (P= 0.01). Concurrently, gabapentin increased from 0 mg-400 mg in the post-cohort (P< 0.01). Patients in the post-cohort were prescribed fewer MMEs than the pre-cohort at discharge (P< 0.05). However, the number of patients prescribed gabapentin increased from 6.1%-16% (P< 0.01).\nImplementation of an updated multimodal analgesia protocol decreased total MME, daily MME, hydromorphone, and oxycodone consumed while increasing gabapentin use. This suggests that while reducing opioid usage in-hospital is critical to reducing outpatient usage, multimodal pain protocols may lead to an increase in gabapentin prescriptions and utilization after discharge.', "Progressive multiple sclerosis (PMS) is a neurological disease associated with the development of depression and anxiety, but treatments available are unsatisfactory. The transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) is a cationic channel activated by reactive compounds, and the blockage of this receptor can reduce depression- and anxiety-like behaviors in naive mice. Thus, we investigated the role of TRPA1 in depression- and anxiety-like behaviors in a PMS model in mice. PMS model was induced in C57BL/6 female mice by the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Nine days after the PMS-EAE induction, behavioral tests (tail suspension and elevated plus maze tests) were performed to verify the effects of sertraline (positive control), selective TRPA1 antagonist (A-967079), and antioxidants (α-lipoic acid and apocynin). The prefrontal cortex and hippocampus were collected to evaluate biochemical and inflammatory markers. PMS-EAE induction did not cause locomotor changes but triggered depression- and anxiety-like behaviors, which were reversed by sertraline, A-967079, α-lipoic acid, or apocynin treatments. The neuroinflammatory markers (AIF1, GFAP, IL-1β, IL-17, and TNF-α) were increased in mice's hippocampus. Moreover, this model did not alter TRPA1 RNA expression levels in the hippocampus but decrease TRPA1 levels in the prefrontal cortex. Moreover, PMS-EAE induced an increase in NADPH oxidase and superoxide dismutase activities and TRPA1 endogenous agonist levels (hydrogen peroxide and 4-hydroxynonenal). TRPA1 plays a fundamental role in depression- and anxiety-like behaviors in a PMS-EAE model; thus, it could be a possible pharmacological target for treating these symptoms in PMS.", 'Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) can activate the extracellular regulated protein kinase (ERK)/cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) cascade revealing an important role in antidepressant effects. Here, we studied the neuroprotective effect of baicalin (BA) in mice with chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS)-induced via a BDNF/ERK/CREB signaling pathway. Depression was induced via six weeks of CUMS in male ICR mice, and drug therapy was given simultaneously for the last three weeks. Cognitive dysfunctions were then evaluated via sucrose preference test (SPT), open field test (OFT), Morris water maze test (MWM), tail suspension test (TST), and novelty suppressed feeding test (NSF). Western blot and real-time PCR were then used to detect the relative expression of ERK, CREB, p-ERK, and p-CREB. Integrated optical density (IOD) tests of p-ERK and p-CREB were then evaluated via immunofluorescence. The behavior results showed that the cognitive dysfunctions increased in the CUMS group versus the control (CON) group (p\u2009<\u2009 0.01). There were decreases in fluoxetine (FLU) and BA groups (p\u2009<\u2009 0.05, p\u2009<\u2009 0.01). The protein ratios of p-ERK/ERK, p-CREB/CREB and ERK mRNA, and CREB mRNA expression decreased in the CUMS group (p\u2009<\u2009 0.01) and markedly increased in the FLU and BA groups (p\u2009<\u2009 0.05, p\u2009<\u2009 0.01). The IOD value of the p-ERK and p-CREB in the CUMS group was decreased versus the CON group (p\u2009<\u2009 0.01), and these changes were improved via BA and FLU treatment (p\u2009<\u2009 0.05, p\u2009<\u2009 0.01). This study indicated that BA can improve cognitive functions and has antidepressant effects in mice, which may be associated with activation of the BDNF/ERK/CREB signaling pathway in the hippocampus.', 'Citalopram, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), has been reported to have adverse effects such as cardiotoxicity, including prolongation of the QTc interval. Although citalopram is well known to be a racemic compound comprised of S-citalopram (escitalopram) and R-citalopram, it is still unclear which enantiomer is responsible for cardiotoxicity induced by citalopram. It is also unclear which biomolecule is the target that produces the adverse effect of citalopram. In this study, we investigated whether citalopram, escitalopram and R-citalopram had an electrophysiological effect on Nav1.5 voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) current and how their electrophysiological properties affected Nav1.5 VGSC. To examine the effects of the electrophysiological properties of them, whole-cell patch clamp recording was performed using HEK293\u202fcells expressing human Nav1.5 VGSCs. Nav1.5 VGSC current decreased by 60.0\u202f±\u202f6.3% and 53.9\u202f±\u202f13.3% under treatment with 100\u202fμM citalopram and escitalopram, respectively. However, 100\u202fμM R-citalopram decreased Nav1.5 VGSC current by only 36.2\u202f±\u202f8.7%. In addition, treatment with 100\u202fμM citalopram and escitalopram changed the voltage-dependence of activation and induced a negative shift of the voltage of half-maximal activation compared to 100\u202fμM R-citalopram. In contrast, treatment with 100\u202fμM citalopram and escitalopram, but not R-citalopram, changed the voltage-dependence of inactivation, and the voltage at half-maximal inactivation slightly shifted toward negative potential. These results suggest that the adverse cardiac effect produced by citalopram might result from modification of the electrophysiological properties of Nav1.5 VGSCs, and escitalopram might contribute more to this adverse effect than R-citalopram.', 'In this review, a timeline starting at the willow bark and ending in the latest discoveries of analgesic and anti-inflammatory drugs will be discussed. Furthermore, the chemical features of the different small organic molecules that have been used in pain management will be studied. Then, the mechanism of different types of pain will be assessed, including neuropathic pain, inflammatory pain, and the relationship found between oxidative stress and pain. This will include obtaining insights into the cyclooxygenase action mechanism of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) such as ibuprofen and etoricoxib and the structural difference between the two cyclooxygenase isoforms leading to a selective inhibition, the action mechanism of pregabalin and its use in chronic neuropathic pain, new theories and studies on the analgesic action mechanism of paracetamol and how changes in its structure can lead to better characteristics of this drug, and cannabinoid action mechanism in managing pain through a cannabinoid receptor mechanism. Finally, an overview of the different approaches science is taking to develop more efficient molecules for pain treatment will be presented.', "Exposure in the womb to antiseizure medications and their potential impact on the developing child's brain has long been researched. Despite this long period of interest, this review highlights above the well-known risks associated with valproate exposure; more data is required for conclusions regarding all other antiseizure medications. Limited experience with phenytoin and phenobarbital in monotherapy clearly defines the risk to later child postnatal functioning difficult. However, the evidence of an impact is stronger for phenobarbital than for phenytoin. The widely prescribed lamotrigine is limited in its investigation compared to unexposed control children. It has been demonstrated to carry a lower risk than valproate for specific outcomes; whether associated with a more moderate impact on broader aspects of neurodevelopmental functioning is still to be understood. Data for levetiracetam, topiramate, and oxcarbazepine are too limited to conclude most neurodevelopmental outcomes confidently. This slow accumulation of evidence impacts the safest use of medications in pregnancy and makes counseling women regarding the risks and benefits of specific antiseizure drugs difficult. Improved focus, funding, and research methodologies are urgently needed.", 'To describe a case of acquired Periodic Alternating Nystagmus (PAN) with oscillopsia treated with botulinum toxin injections into four horizontal rectus muscles.\nA 22-year-old woman presented with sudden onset PAN. The only abnormality found following extensive investigations was bilateral superior cerebellar peduncle atrophy on MRI. Various treatment options were discussed, with reasonable response to baclofen, less so to gabapentin. However, she was keen for a longer-term solution without medication-related adverse effects. She was offered weakening of all four horizontal rectus muscles recessions, either with botulinum toxin or surgery, and she opted for the former to simulate the effects of surgery. 2.5 units of Dysport were injected into each horizontal rectus muscle without adverse effect.\nOff all treatment, Snellen Visual Acuity (VA) was 6/12 in either eye with oscillopsia as a result of the PAN. Post-botulinum toxin VA was 6/5 and 6/6 on the right and left respectively, with both subjective and objective improvement in the nystagmus and oscillopsia.\nBotulinum toxin has an important role in the nystagmus and strabismus clinics. Depending on the circumstances, it may be used as either long term treatment, or for surgical planning to simulate the effects of surgery. In this case, the effects were equivalent to high dose of baclofen and four horizontal rectus muscles recessions, which she underwent when the effects of the botulinum toxin had worn off. Botulinum toxin could be considered as a treatment option in acquired PAN, particularly in women of childbearing age and/or if intolerant or refractory to medical treatment, but ideally not as a long-term treatment option.', 'Stroke is the primary cause of disability worldwide, the second most common cause of dementia and the third leading cause of death. Only few studies were conducted to study the role of fluoxetine in motor recovery in either ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke patients with probably less severe paresis. However, the current study evaluates both the effectiveness and safety of fluoxetine in the stroke population with a more severe motor deficit.\nPatients who had acute or subacute stroke with hemiparesis and aged between 18 and 80 years with medical research council (MRC) scale score <4 were included in this randomized, Single-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 1:1 ratio to placebo or fluoxetine 20\xa0mg/day orally for 90 days. The primary outcome measures were changes in barthel index, time taken to complete nine hole peg test and number of hand tapping movements in 30\xa0s by the affected limb between baseline, 45th day and 90th day. The secondary outcome measure was evaluation of the drug tolerability.\nA total of 168 patients were assigned to fluoxetine (n\xa0=\xa084) or placebo (n\xa0=\xa084) group. Mean BI score significantly improved at 90th day in fluoxetine group (70.42\xa0±\xa010.56) than in placebo group (44.23\xa0±\xa08.52). Mean dexterity value decreased significantly at 90th day (2.61\xa0±\xa00.81) compared to baseline (3.98\xa0±\xa00.53) in fluoxetine group. However higher rate of decrease of mean dexterity value was seen in fluoxetine group when compared to placebo group. Mean number of hands tapping movements in 30\xa0s increased significantly at 90th day (16.33\xa0±\xa03.58) compared to baseline (9.83\xa0±\xa02.92) in fluoxetine group. Few ADR reported during this study were dizziness, drowsiness and insomnia.\nThe present study indicates that early prescription of fluoxetine is safe and may enhance motor function in patients presenting with severe motor impairments after stroke. However, the findings of the study should be confirmed in future controlled studies with large sample size.', "Gastrointestinal side effects of interferon (IFN) therapy for chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection are non-specific. Rarely, this therapy has been reported to induce ischemic colitis and even ulcerative colitis. However, IFN-induced Crohn's disease (CD) has previously been reported in only two individuals. We share our own experience of a patient treated for chronic HCV infection who developed CD after IFN therapy for chronic HCV infection. A 28-year-old asymptomatic man with a history only of chronic HCV infection was treated with IFN and ribavirin, which he tolerated for 18 months and achieved sustained viral response (SVR). Halfway through the IFN regimen, he noticed infrequent painful bowel movements and bloody diarrhea. Following treatment, his symptoms resolved. Six months after therapy, colonoscopy showed a normal terminal ileum and colitis with skipped lesions and rectal sparing. Pathology demonstrated spotty chronic active colitis, with diffuse cryptitis, crypt distortion, and abundant abscesses, compatible with CD. The patient declined treatment and remained asymptomatic for two years. Labs including C-\u200breactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte\xa0sedimentation rate\xa0(ESR), fecal calprotectin, and celiac panel were normal. Upper GI endoscopy and capsule endoscopy were normal. Repeat colonoscopy showed normal terminal ileum and normal colonic mucosa, and biopsies of the terminal ileum and all segments of the colon were unremarkable. The patient was observed off treatment and has continued to remain asymptomatic, with a resolution of symptoms and disease continuing away from IFN exposure. This is a rare case of CD induced by IFN, exhibiting significant importance regarding the evaluation of new cases of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Gastroenterologists need to keep in mind that INF therapy can be an uncommon cause of IBD.", '3D printing is a promising technology used in the fabrication of complex oral dosage delivery pharmaceuticals. This study first reports an innovative color jet 3D printing (CJ-3DP) technology to produce colorful cartoon levetiracetam pediatric preparations with high accuracy and reproducibility. For this study, the ideal printing ink consisted of 40% (v/v) isopropanol aqueous solution containing 0.05% (w/w) polyvinylpyrrolidone and 4% (w/w) glycerin, which was satisfied with scale-up of the production. The external and internal spatial structures of the tablets were designed to control the appearance and release, and cartoon tablets with admirable appearances and immediate release characteristics were printed. The dosage model showed a good linear relationship between the model volume and the tablet strength (', "Pica in Alzheimer's disease (AD) makes it difficult for caregivers to provide care. However, few effective medications have been reported for pica in AD. We report a case of AD with pica that was successfully improved by trazodone and fluvoxamine. An 80-year-old woman with AD was admitted to our hospital due to aggravated pica, including eating weeds in the facility's garden and eating a dishwashing sponge. Her pica was accompanied by oral tendency, prosopagnosia, and placidity. She took rivastigmine and memantine, but these were ineffective for her pica. She was given olanzapine and perospirone, but both were discontinued due to over-sedation and severe extrapyramidal symptoms, respectively. We then administered trazodone and fluvoxamine, both of which have demonstrated effectiveness for pica in frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Her pica behaviors then disappeared without daytime sleepiness. In this case, pica with oral tendency, which was accompanied by prosopagnosia and placidity, may be interpreted as a partial symptom of Klüver-Bucy syndrome (KBS). KBS is often seen in FTD, but also occurs in late-stage AD. Our case together with previous reports showing that trazodone and fluvoxamine were effective for pica in FTD suggest that the same common drug therapy may be successful in pica with oral tendency, regardless of the subtype of dementia.", 'The depression during and after pregnancy cause significant exposure of fluoxetine to the child at early life through mother. This exposure to the child, during the vulnerable window of development, can have a long lasting impact on overall mental wellbeing. Long term neurobehavioral aspect of developmental toxicity is neglected as the part of testing requirements in the process of drug developmental. In this context, the present study was designed to study the possible effect of pre-weaning fluoxetine exposure on the social behavior of rats upon adulthood followed by assessing hippocampal morphometry (hematoxylin-eosin and silver staining) and post-synaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95) expression (using qPCR). Our data showed that the fluoxetine exposure (10, 50 and 100mg/kg) caused predominant increase in the social behavior of rats; the effect more pronounced in female rats. The morphometric analysis revealed significant increase in cell population and count of dentate gyrus (DG) region of hippocampus along with enhanced dendritic arborization. Furthermore, the PSD-95 expression was found to be down regulated in the fluoxetine treated group as compared to control. In conclusion, the present study demonstrate that the early post-natal exposure to fluoxetine cause hypersociability upon attaining adulthood, which may be attributed to enhanced neuronal proliferation and decrease PSD-95 expression in the hippocampus.', 'Numerous drugs have been associated with urinary retention (UR), but updated information on drugs that may induce UR is limited.\nTo evaluate drug-induced UR using the Italian spontaneous adverse drug reactions (ADRs) reporting database.\nWe selected all suspected spontaneous reports of drug-induced UR collected into the Italian spontaneous reporting system (SRS) database from its inception to June 30, 2019.\nThe Mantel-Haenszel χ\nA total of 506 383 ADR reports were received in the Italian SRS database during the study period. Of these, 421 reports (0.1%) included UR-related ADRs, for a total of 497 suspected drugs. The median (interquartile range [IQR]) age of patients experiencing UR was 67 (47-77) yr. Overall, 174 (41.3%) ADR reports were considered serious. One-third of male patients experiencing UR suffered from benign prostatic hyperplasia, followed by diabetes mellitus (N\u2009=\u200958, 13.8%), and bladder-related disorders (N\u2009=\u200921, 5.0%). The median lag time between the start of drug treatment and UR onset was 7 (IQR 1-47.5) d. Overall, a statistically significant ROR was reported for 39 individual drugs, and for five (12.8%) of them (dapagliflozin, gabapentin, lithium, celecoxib, and piroxicam) UR was not described in their summary of product characteristics. Limitations include under-reporting and selective over-reporting of suspected ADRs and lacking information on the number of drug users.\nA disproportionality analysis identified five potentially new UR signals for dapagliflozin, gabapentin, lithium, celecoxib, and piroxicam, requiring further evaluation.\nIn this analysis of the Italian spontaneous reporting system database, we found new urinary retention signals, requiring further evaluation, for dapagliflozin, gabapentin, lithium, celecoxib, and piroxicam.', "To describe the prescribing practices for gabapentin as an analgesic within the veterinary community.\nAnonymous online voluntary survey.\nA total of 718 veterinarians within the United States and Canada, including general practitioners and diplomates of the American Colleges of Veterinary Anesthesia and Analgesia, Emergency and Critical Care, Surgery and Internal Medicine.\nAn anonymous online survey was used to gather information about individual prescribing practices for gabapentin including frequency of use, reasons for prescribing and procedures for authorizing refill requests. Questions specific to gabapentin covered mechanisms of action, perceptions of efficacy and the potential for abuse in people. Dunn's test for multiple comparisons and pairwise Mann-Whitney U test were used to evaluate relationships between veterinary specialty and survey responses.\nA total of 718 veterinarians responded to the survey, 528 (73.5%) answered all questions of the survey to completion. Frequency of prescribing was high with 365/529 (69.0%) of respondents prescribing gabapentin as an analgesic on a daily or weekly basis. Surgeons and general practitioners used gabapentin significantly more frequently than other groups, with surgeons more likely to prescribe gabapentin for postoperative pain. The most common reason [254/517 (49.1%)] survey respondents prescribed gabapentin as an analgesic was because administration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication was contraindicated for that animal. The majority of survey respondents [362/527 (68.7%)] considered the abuse potential of gabapentin to be low in people.\nVeterinary prescribing practices for gabapentin closely mirrored that of human physicians, with gabapentin being prescribed frequently and for uses largely unrelated to its labeled indication. The perception of the potential for abuse of gabapentin is low within the veterinary community.", 'The\xa0biosynthesis of milk fat affects both the technological properties and organoleptic quality of milk and dairy products. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small non-coding RNAs that inhibit the expression of their mRNA targets and are involved in downstream signaling pathways that control several biological processes, including milk fat synthesis. miR-34b is a member of the miR-34 miRNA cluster, which is differentially expressed in the mammary gland tissue of dairy cows during lactation and dry periods. Previous studies have indicated miR-34b is a potential candidate gene that plays a decisive role in regulating milk fat synthesis; therefore, it is important to focus on miR-34b and investigate its regulatory effect on the biosynthesis of milk fat in bovine mammary epithelial cells (BMECs).\nIn this study, elevated miR-34b levels reduced milk fat synthesis, upregulated 1,999 genes, and downregulated 2,009 genes in BMECs. Moreover, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis of differentially expressed genes suggested that miR-34b may play an inhibitory role in milk fat synthesis via the protein kinase B (Akt)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway by reducing phosphorylation levels. Notably, the mTOR activator MHY1485 rescued the inhibitory effect of miR-34b. Furthermore, we demonstrated that retinoic acid-induced protein 14 (RAI14) is a target of miR-34b via TargetScan and immunofluorescence assays. RAI14 mRNA and protein levels were significantly decreased by the miR-34b mimic and increased by the miR-34b inhibitor. Moreover, the reduction in RAI14 levels led to the inhibition of the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway.\nOverall, our results identified a miR-34b-RAI14-Akt/mTOR regulatory network, while also providing a theoretical basis for the molecular breeding of dairy cows.', 'Naratriptan, marketed in a low oral dose of 2.5\u2009mg, is generally regarded as a less-effective triptan with a slower onset of action than most other triptans in the treatment of migraine attacks. In this review, naratriptan will be compared with sumatriptan, the standard triptan.\nPapers on pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics and results from comparative clinical trials with oral and subcutaneous naratriptan versus other triptans were retrieved from PubMed.\nNaratriptan and sumatriptan have similar effects in relevant animal models. In a randomized controlled trial, oral naratriptan 2.5\u2009mg is less effective than oral sumatriptan 100\u2009mg after both 2\u2009h and 4 h. In contrast, oral naratriptan 10\u2009mg has a similar time-effect curve as oral sumatriptan 100\u2009mg, in both its steepness and the efficacy at 2\u2009h and 4 h. Subcutaneous naratriptan 10\u2009mg (88% pain free at 2 h) was in one trial superior to subcutaneous sumatriptan 6\u2009mg (55% pain free at 2 h).\nNaratriptan was marketed for the treatment of migraine attacks as the "gentle triptan" in a low oral dose of 2.5\u2009mg, a dose with no more adverse events than placebo. This low dose results in the slow onset of action and low efficacy of oral naratriptan, but in high doses oral naratriptan is similar to oral sumatriptan. Based on one randomized controlled trial, subcutaneous naratriptan has probably the greatest effect of any triptan.', "For patients with osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee, pain is the most debilitating symptom. Although it has been proposed that the chronic phase of the monoiodoacetate (MIA)-induced rodent model of knee joint pain may be superior to other chronic or acute OA models for assessing the analgesic efficacy of novel molecules, relatively few pharmacological studies have been conducted in the chronic phase of this model. Hence this study was designed to use pharmacological methods to characterize the chronic phase of the MIA-induced rat model of knee joint OA pain. Rats received a single intraarticular injection of MIA at 2.5 mg or vehicle (saline) into the left (ipsilateral) knee joint. Pain behaviour was assessed by measuring paw withdrawal thresholds (PWTs) in the hindpaws pre-MIA injection twice-weekly until study completion on day 42. Mechanical allodynia was fully developed in the ipsilateral hindpaws (PWTs ≤ 6g) from day 7 and it persisted until day 42. MIA-injected rats with PWTs ≤ 6g in the ipsilateral hindpaws received single doses of one of four clinically-available drugs that represent four distinct pharmacological classes, viz gabapentin, amitriptyline, meloxicam and morphine, according to a 'washout' protocol with at least 48 h between successive doses. Gabapentin evoked dose-dependent anti-allodynia as did morphine whereas amitriptyline and meloxicam were inactive. Our findings are aligned with clinical data showing that gabapentin and morphine alleviated OA pain in the knee. The lack of efficacy of amitriptyline is consistent with the loss of descending diffuse noxious inhibitory controls reported by others in this model.", 'Diverse ethnic genetic populations display variability in the risk regarding anti-seizure medicine (ASM)-induced severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs). However, clinical and epidemiological data on ASM-induced SCARs in Asians is limited.\nWe conducted a retrospective, post-market study until April 30, 2020 using VigiBase® for demographic characteristics, causative ASMs, complications and mortality. The study included adverse events as classified by Standardized Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) queries of SCARs, mainly Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and SJS/TEN overlap reported for ASMs.\nA total of 694,811 adverse events were reported across the world while using ASMs. Of this, skin and subcutaneous tissue adverse events were 122,885 (17.6%). Among ASM-induced skin and subcutaneous tissue adverse events, SJS, TEN, DRESS and SJS/TEN overlap represented 11,181 (9.1%), 3,645 (3.0%), 5,106 (4.1%) and 6 (0.004%) cases, respectively. Female SJS/TEN/DRESS patients were 54.1%, and 75% of them were adults (>18Y). Nearly 64% of the ASM-induced SCARs were serious and culminated in death (3.5%), life-threatening conditions (11.5%), and hospitalization/prolonged hospitalization (43.5%) of patients on ASM therapy. Carbamazepine (31.6%), phenytoin (29.6%), lamotrigine (24.3%), valproic acid (6.4%) and phenobarbital (5.7%) are the most commonly used ASMs linked with SCARs. ASMs associated with significantly higher risk of SCARs in Asians were carbamazepine [n\xa0=\xa03265, ROR 3.55 (95% CI 3.38-3.72, P\xa0<\xa00.0001)], lamotrigine [n\xa0=\xa01253, ROR 3.90 (95% CI 3.63-4.18, P\xa0<\xa00.0001)], gabapentin [n\xa0=\xa085, ROR 3.58 (95% CI 2.79-4.60, P\xa0<\xa00.0001)], pregabalin [n\xa0=\xa068, ROR 3.16 (95% CI 2.40-4.16, P\xa0<\xa00.0001)], clonazepam [n\xa0=\xa053, ROR 3.19 (95% CI 2.31-4.41, P\xa0<\xa00.0001)], lorazepam [n\xa0=\xa031, ROR 3.07 (95% CI 2.06-4.59, P\xa0<\xa00.0001)] and acetazolamide [n\xa0=\xa028, ROR 3.90 (95% CI 2.45-6.21, P\xa0<\xa00.0001)].\nBased on our study, carbamazepine, lamotrigine, gabapentin, pregabalin, clonazepam, lorazepam, and acetazolamide are the most common causative ASMs for SCARs in the Asian population.', 'To investigate the impact of antidepressants (ATDs) on the risk of myocardial infarction (MI) among patients with diabetes mellitus (DM).\nThis was a retrospective population-based cohort study that used data obtained from the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan. The study cohort included diabetic patients who were older than 50 years from 1997 to 2010. We then randomly assigned individuals to the matched cohort at a 1:1 ratio according to their demographic data. Both study and matched cohorts were followed up to compare the risk of MI between patients with and without ATD use from 2000 until the end of 2013. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate the relationship between ATD treatment and the occurrence of MI.\nAfter adjustment for confounders, patients with ATD use of more than 180 days had a lower risk of MI than those without ATD use in the matched cohort (adjusted hazard ratio [HR]\xa0=\xa00.68, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.66-0.71). The adjusted HRs of MI were 0.77 (95% CI, 0.73-0.81) and 0.56 (95% CI, 052.-0.60) in patients with DM and ATD use of 180 > cDDD ≥ 28 and cDDD ≥ 180, respectively. When the duration of ATD treatment was 180 days or longer, MI risk was significantly reduced (after adjustment) for all classes of ATD except bupropion.\nMost ATDs, but not bupropion, were associated with significantly reduced risk of MI among the DM population.', 'Very preterm infants are at high risk of developing chronic lung disease, which requires respiratory support and might have long-term sequelae. As lung inflammation plays an important role in pathogenesis, antileukotrienes have been explored in both clinical and animal studies. We aimed to assess the benefits and harms of antileukotrienes for the prevention and treatment of respiratory morbidity and mortality in very preterm newborns.\nIn this systematic review, we included randomized trials and non-randomized studies in humans and animals reporting the effects of antileukotrienes in very preterm infants or other mammals within 10\xa0days of birth. Our pre-specified primary outcomes were all-cause mortality and any harm, and, for the clinical studies, incidence of chronic lung disease. Included studies underwent risk of bias-assessment and data extraction performed by two authors independently. There were no language restrictions.\nFifteen studies totally met our inclusion criteria: one randomized trial and four non-randomized studies in humans and 10 animal studies (five in rodents, two in lambs and one in either guinea pigs, rabbits or caprinae). All five clinical studies used montelukast and had a small sample size, ranging from 4 to 77 infants. The randomized trial (n\u2009=\u200960) found no difference in the incidence of chronic lung disease between the groups.\xa0Only one clinical study, which enrolled four very preterm infants and had a critical overall risk of bias, reported long-term outcomes. All other studies had unclear or greater overall risk of bias and meta-analyses were therefore deemed unfeasible. Eight of ten animal studies used leukotriene receptor antagonists as antileukotriene (montelukast in three of ten studies) and seven had an experimental study design (i.e. some animals were not exposed to antileukotrienes but no randomization). Three of the ten animal studies assessed different doses. Animal studies found no effect on the outcomes mortality, growth, or lung function related surrogate outcomes.\nUse of antileukotrienes in very preterm infants to prevent or treat chronic lung disease is not supported by the available evidence. Large randomized trials focusing on outcomes relevant to patients, including long-term outcomes, are needed. Studies should also minimize risk of bias.', 'Predicting drug-drug interactions (DDIs) from in vitro data is made difficult by not knowing concentrations of substrate and inhibitor at the target site. For in vivo targets, this is understandable, since intracellular concentrations can differ from extracellular concentrations. More vexing is that the concentration of the drug at the target for some in vitro assays can also be unknown. This uncertainty has resulted in standard in vitro practices that cannot accurately predict human pharmacokinetics. This case study highlights the impact of drug distribution, both in vitro and in vivo, with the example of the drug interaction potential of montelukast.', "Head-to-head comparator trials between first-line oral migraine preventatives and the new monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) blocking the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) pathway have not been published to date.\nThis study aimed to indirectly compare the clinical efficacy and safety of mAbs against CGRP\xa0or its\xa0receptor (CGRPR) and topiramate in episodic migraine prophylaxis using meta-analysis.\nWe included controlled trials testing efficacy and safety of erenumab, galcanezumab, fremanezumab, eptinezumab, and topiramate in adults diagnosed with episodic migraine. We searched PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and ClinicalTrials.gov from January 2000 to November 2020. We used the Risk of Bias 2 (RoB2) tool to assess the risk of bias and report pooled mean effects (mean difference and risk ratio) as estimated in a random effect model. For efficacy analysis, we determined the reduction of monthly migraine days (MMDs), reduction of days with acute medication (AMDs), and 50% responder rates (50% RR). For safety, we determined adverse events (AEs) occurring in ≥ 2% of study participants and the number of patients who discontinue treatment due to AEs (DAEs). The number needed to treat (NNT) and to harm (NNH) were estimated as well as the likelihood to help or harm (LLH).\nWe included 13 trials involving 7557 patients: three trials with erenumab, two trials with galcanezumab, two trials with fremanezumab, one trial with eptinezumab, and five trials with topiramate, for the prophylaxis of episodic migraine in adults. The placebo-subtracted reduction (pooled mean difference) of MMDs were - 1.55 (95% CI - 1.86 to - 1.24; active drug n\xa0=\xa03326 vs placebo n\xa0=\xa02219, 8 studies) for the CGRP(R) mAb and - 1.11 (95% CI - 1.62 to - 0.59; active drug n\xa0=\xa01032 vs placebo n\xa0=\xa0543, 4 studies) for topiramate (p for subgroup difference = 0.15). 'Cognitive' and 'sensory & pain'-related adverse events occurred more often in patients treated with topiramate compared with those treated with a CGRP(R) mAb (p for subgroup difference 0.03 and < 0.001, respectively). Based on the 50% RR and DAE, the NNT, NNH, and LHH for the CGRP(R) mAbs were 6, 130, and 24.3:1, respectively. For topiramate, these values were 7, 9, and 1.8:1, respectively.\nThe efficacy of CGRP(R) mAbs to reduce migraine days does not differ from topiramate. However, the safety profile is in favor of the CGRP(R) mAbs, with a higher likelihood to help than to harm compared with topiramate. The diversity of endpoint determination and the heterogeneity between studies for some endpoints cause some limitations for this study.", 'To analyse the influence of chromosomal aberrations in addition to t(15;17)(q22;q21) in acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) on clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes.\nFifty-seven patients with new APL diagnoses underwent conventional cytogenetic analysis; fluorescence in situ hybridization for t(15;17)(q22;q21) and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction detected PML/RARα in two forms: L (length) and S (short) and accepted treatment with all-trans retinoic acid and chemotherapy. Patients with additional chromosome aberrations were designated as the complex karyotype group and were compared with patients with only t(15;17), who were designated as the simple karyotype group.\nAdditional chromosome aberrations was observed in 18/57 patients (31.6%) at initial diagnosis. Outcome was significantly different between the simple karyotype group and the complex karyotype group for complete remission (92.3% vs. 66.7% respectively, p\u202f=\u202f.025), overall survival at 3\u202fyears (92.3% vs. 65.0%, respectively, p\u202f=\u202f.017), and progression-free survival at 3\u202fyears (81.4% vs. 44.4%, respectively, p\u202f=\u202f.024).\nAdditional chromosome aberrations had adverse effects on the prognosis in APL.', 'Reportedly, decreases in fatty acid (FA) chain length of ceramide (CER) are associated with interferon-γ (IFN-γ), which shows increased expression in psoriasis. However, the underlying mechanism of this association remain unclear. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to clarify this association between FA chain length of CER , IFN-γ, and the major transcriptional factors involving psoriasis. CER profiling according to FA chain length and class was performed in murine epidermis (n = 10 BALB/c mice topically treated with imiquimod (IMQ), n = 10 controls) and human stratum corneum (SC) (n = 12 psoriasis, n = 11 controls). The expression of lipid synthetic enzymes, including elongases (ELOVLs), in murine epidermis was also measured using RT-PCR. Furthermore, the association of IFN-γ with various enzymes and transcription factors involved in the generation of long-chain CERs was also investigated using in vitro keratinocyte. A significant decrease in the percentage of long-chain CERs was observed in psoriasis-like murine epidermis and human psoriatic SC. Additionally, the expression levels of ELOVL1, ELOVL4, and ceramide synthase3 (CerS3) were significantly decreased in psoriasis-like murine epidermis and IFN-γ-treated keratinocyte. There was also a significant decrease in the expression of transcriptional factors, including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR), in IFN-γ treated keratinocyte. Thus, it could be suggested that IFN-γ may regulate ELOVL and CerS levels by down-regulating the transcriptional factors. Additionally, given the possible involvement of PPARs or liver X receptor agonist in the CER elongation process, they may serve as potential therapeutic agents for lengthening the CER FAs in psoriasis.', 'Despite therapeutic advances, early death (ED) remains a major factor curtailing survival of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Studies examining factors that cause early death (ED; within 30 days of admission) and the correlation of survival with the timing of administration of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and hemostatic parameters are scarce. We performed a cohort analysis of nonselect patients with newly diagnosed APL who presented to the health care system in Hong Kong, where oral arsenic trioxide was used. From 1 January 2007 to 30 April 2020, 358 patients (median age, 47 [1-97] years) with newly diagnosed APL were identified. ED occurred in 56 patients (16%): 11 (3%) died in the first 2 days after admission (intracranial hemorrhage [ICH], n = 6; APL-differentiation syndrome [APL-DS], n = 4; infection, n = 1); 22 (6%) died within 3 to 7 days (ICH, n = 12; APL-DS, n = 8; infections, n = 2), and 23 (6%) died within 8 to 30 days (ICH, n = 7; APL-DS, n = 11; infection, n = 5). Factors significantly associated with ED by multivariate analysis included male sex (P = .01); presenting leukocyte count ≥10 × 109/L (P = .03); fibrinogen <1.5 g/L (P = .02); and ATRA administration >24 hours after hospital admission (P < .001). After a median follow-up of 47 (0-166) months, the 5- and 10-year overall survival (OS) was 68.6% and 61.2%, respectively. Excluding EDs, the 5- and 10-year post-30-day OS improved to 81.3% and 72.5%. Early administration of ATRA (<24 hours) and vigorous correction of hemostatic abnormalities, including hypofibrinogenemia, are key to reducing ED.', "A large number of people experience misophonia. In 2013, the Amsterdam Study Group recommended diagnostic criteria for misophonia. However, misophonia is not yet included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. This report is the first report on drug use that directly affects misophonia and demonstrates a 14-year-old adolescent girl with misophonia successfully treated with fluoxetine.\nThe patient's misophonia symptoms had been continuing for approximately 2 years, and her quality of life was significantly reduced. Psychotherapy conditions could not be applied, and fluoxetine 10 mg/d was started and increased to 20 mg/d after a week. At the second-month follow-up, because of partial improvement, fluoxetine dose was increased to 30 mg/d.\nAt the fourth-month follow-up, there was a 40% decrease in Amsterdam Misophonia Scale score with a 70% decrease in the children's global assessment scale scores. By the 16th week, the overall functionality level was good at the end.\nFluoxetine may be used as an effective drug in the treatment of misophonia.", "Fibromyalgia (FM) is a complex pathology described as persistent hyperalgesia including somatic and mood dysfunctions, depression and anxiety. Although the etiology of FM is still unknown, a significant decrease in biogenic amines is a common characteristic in its pathogenesis. Here, our main objective was to investigate the role of dopamine D3/D2 receptor during the reserpine-induced pain in mice. Our results showed that pramipexole (PPX) - a dopaminergic D3/D2 receptor agonist - inhibited mechanical allodynia and thermal sensitivity induced by reserpine. Relevantly, PPX treatment decreased immobility time and increased the number of grooming in the forced swimming test and splash test, respectively. Animals that received PPX remained longer in the open arms than the reserpine group using elevated plus-maze apparatus. The repeated PPX administration, given daily for 4 days, significantly blocked the mechanical and thermal allodynia during FM model, similarly to pregabalin, although it failed to affect the reserpine-induced thermal nociception. Reserpine administration induced significant downregulation of dopamine concentration in the central nervous system, and repeated treatment with PPX restored dopamine levels in the frontal cortex and spinal cord tissues. Moreover, PPX treatment inhibited oxidants production such as DCFH (2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein) and nitrite, also decreased oxidative damage (carbonyl), and upregulated the activity of superoxide dismutase in the spinal cord. Together, our findings demonstrated the ability of dopamine D3/D2 receptor-preferring agonist in reducing pain and mood dysfunction allied to FM in mice. All experimental protocols were approved by the Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina (UFSC) Ethics Committee (approval No. 2572210218) on May 10, 2018.", 'Variation in the efficacy and safety of central nervous system drugs between humans and rodents can be explained by physiological differences between species. An important factor could be P-glycoprotein (Pgp) activity in the blood-brain barrier (BBB), as BBB expression of this drug efflux transporter is reportedly lower in humans compared to mouse and rat and subject to an age-dependent increase. This might complicate animal to human extrapolation of brain drug disposition and toxicity, especially in children. In this study, the potential species-specific effect of BBB Pgp activity on brain drug exposure was investigated. An age-dependent brain PBPK model was used to predict cerebrospinal fluid and brain mass concentrations of Pgp substrate drugs. For digoxin, verapamil and quinidine, in vitro kinetic data on their transport by Pgp were derived from literature and used to scale to in vivo parameters. In addition, age-specific digoxin transport was simulated for children with a postnatal age between 25 and 81\xa0days. BBB Pgp activity in the model was optimized using measured CSF data for the Pgp substrates ivermectin, indinavir, vincristine, docetaxel, paclitaxel, olanzapine and citalopram, as no useful in vitro data were available. Inclusion of Pgp activity in the model resulted in optimized predictions of their brain concentration. Total brain-to-plasma AUC values (Kp,brain) in the simulations without Pgp were divided by the Kp,brain values with Pgp. Kp ratios ranged from 1 to 45 for the substrates investigated. Comparison of human with rodent Kp,brain ratios indicated\u2009≥\u2009twofold lower values in human for digoxin, verapamil, indinavir, paclitaxel and citalopram and\u2009≥\u2009twofold higher values for vincristine. In conclusion, BBB Pgp activity appears species-specific. An age-dependent PBPK model-based approach could be useful to extrapolate animal data to human adult and paediatric predictions by taking into account species-specific and developmental BBB Pgp expression.', 'Relapses of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) beyond 7 years from the first molecular remission are exceptional, and it is unclear whether these relapses represent a new, therapy-related leukemia rather than a delayed relapse of the original leukemic clone. The increase extra-medullary relapses (ER) in the era of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) therapy suggests a potential correlation between ATRA therapy and ER, and several potential explanations have been proposed. The gold standard post-remission approach, particularly for patients in late relapse, has not yet been established. The benefit of a transplant approach has been questioned in this setting because continuing ATRA-arsenic trioxide (ATO) might be curative. Here we report on the case of an APL patient who relapsed 9 years after achieving her first molecular complete remission (mCR) and who showed an atypical isolated localization at nodal sites, including the into- and peri-parotid glands.

MPH is believed to exert its pharmacological effects via preferential blockade of the dopamine transporter (DAT) and the norepinephrine transporter (NET), resulting in increased monoamine levels in the synapse. We used a quantitative non-invasive PET imaging technique to study the effects of long-term methylphenidate use on the central nervous system (CNS). We conducted microPET/CT scans on young adult male rhesus monkeys to monitor changes in the dopaminergic system. We used [', 'The Norwegian Association for Clinical Pharmacology in their National Guidelines decreased therapeutic range (TR) of topiramate (TPM) from 5-20 mg/L to 2-10 mg/L. The objective of this study is to ascertain which TR produces better clinical outcomes.\nData source were request forms for routine therapeutic drug monitoring of TPM. Concentration dependent adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were evaluated in 1,721 samples taken pre-dose. Seizure frequency analysis was performed in 294 samples of monotherapy.\nPrism 5.0, GraphPad Instatt: One-way Anova with Bonferroni correction for median plasma level (PL). χ2-test with Bonferroni correction for seizure frequency and for distribution of PL according to TR 5-20 mg/L and intervals <2, 2-5, 5-10, 10-20, >20 mg/L.\nBetter seizure control was found in children both in whole cohort (without seizure 49% vs 37% adults), as well as in monotherapy (56% vs 44%), in children with PL 5-20 mg/L vs <5 mg/L (65% vs 44%) and in children with PL 5-10 mg/L vs <2 mg/L (63 vs 14%). PL in seizure-free patients did not differ from those with seizure. Seizure control was poorer in the period 2003-2005 compared to 2006-2011. ADRs reported in 38 samples (2.8%) were without relation to PL.\nChange of TR is not recommended.', "Certain components of rest-activity rhythms such as greater eveningness (delayed phase), physical inactivity (blunted amplitude) and shift work (irregularity) are associated with increased risk for drug use. Dopaminergic (DA) signaling has been hypothesized to mediate the associations, though clinical evidence is lacking.\nWe examined associations between rhythm components and striatal D1 (D1R) and D2/3 receptor (D2/3R) availability in 32 healthy adults (12 female, age: 42.40±12.22) and its relationship to drug reward. Rest-activity rhythms were assessed by one-week actigraphy combined with self-reports. [11C]NNC112 and [11C]raclopride Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scans were conducted to measure D1R and D2/3R availability, respectively. Additionally, self-reported drug-rewarding effects of 60 mg oral methylphenidate were assessed.\nWe found that delayed rhythm was associated with higher D1R availability in caudate, which was not attributable to sleep loss or 'social jet lag', whereas physical inactivity was associated with higher D2/3R availability in nucleus accumbens (NAc). Delayed rest-activity rhythm, higher caudate D1R and NAc D2/3R availability were associated with greater sensitivity to the rewarding effects of methylphenidate.\nThese findings reveal specific components of rest-activity rhythms associated with striatal D1R, D2/3R availability and drug-rewarding effects. Personalized interventions that target rest-activity rhythms may help prevent and treat substance use disorders.\nClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03190954FUNDING.

Publications targeting surgical workflow have resulted in decreased infection and revision rates, but a standard workflow for the entire pathway has not been described. To present, define, and test standard work tools for patients receiving ITB to promote uniformity and standard of care in the field.\nA multidisciplinary approach from the movement disorder program of a tertiary care center defined all steps comprising the ITB pathway, and then developed standard work tools to decrease variability with respect to preoperative workup, day of surgery protocol, post-operative care, and also evaluation and treatment with respect to pump infection or malfunction.\nDefined steps used at specific points of ITB pathway are presented with a single institution's outcome using the protocol from July 2017 to November 2020.

The effects of the administration of CBD (20\xa0mg/kg, i.p.) and/or STR (10\xa0mg/kg, p.o.) were analyzed on behavioral and gene expression changes induced by the model of PTSD. Gene expression alterations of targets related with stress regulation, endocannabinoid and serotonergic systems were analyzed by real-time PCR. The results revealed an increased and long-lasting fear-related memory and anxiety-like behaviors in mice exposed to the animal model of PTSD.

Rescheduling gabapentin as a schedule V controlled substance may strengthen monitoring and prescribing restrictions. The purpose of this study was to characterize the impact of rescheduling gabapentin from a nonscheduled to a schedule V substance in Virginia on discharge prescribing patterns in a health system.\nThis was a retrospective, pre-post, multicenter chart review conducted at 4 sites. Data from 3 months before gabapentin rescheduling (prerescheduling group) and 3 months after gabapentin rescheduling (postrescheduling group) were evaluated. The primary outcome was the percentage of newly prescribed gabapentin prescriptions upon discharge, which was compared between the pre- and postrescheduling groups.\nA similar percentage of gabapentin prescriptions were newly prescribed in the prerescheduling group as compared to the postrescheduling group (55.0% vs 50.0%, P = 0.479). Gabapentin prescribing characteristics did not differ between the groups for new gabapentin prescriptions (n = 55 in the prerescheduling group, n = 50 in the postrescheduling group). Concomitant discharge prescribing of benzodiazepines (5.5% vs 2.0%, P = 0.619) and opioids (45.5% vs 60.0%, P = 0.136) did not differ significantly between the postrescheduling group and prerescheduling group for new gabapentin prescriptions. However, fewer opioid prescriptions exceeded 90 daily morphine milligram equivalents (MME) in the postrescheduling group as compared to the prerescheduling group for new gabapentin prescriptions (36.0% vs 20.0%, P = 0.020).\nGabapentin prescribing practices did not differ before and after rescheduling of gabapentin as a controlled substance. There was a trend toward dosages with reduced daily MME for concomitant opioid prescriptions after rescheduling. However, additional investigation with larger studies over longer periods of time is needed to discover whether gabapentin rescheduling significantly changes prescribing practices.', 'Abacavir is part of WHO-recommended regimens to treat HIV in children under 15 years of age. In a pooled analysis across four studies, we describe abacavir population pharmacokinetics to investigate the influence of age, concomitant medications, malnutrition and formulation.\nA total of 230 HIV-infected African children were included, with median (range) age of 2.1 (0.1-12.8) years and weight of 9.8 (2.5-30.0) kg. The population pharmacokinetics of abacavir was described using nonlinear mixed-effects modelling.\nAbacavir pharmacokinetics was best described by a two-compartment model with first-order elimination, and absorption described by transit compartments. Clearance was predicted around 54% of its mature value at birth and 90% at 10 months. The estimated typical clearance at steady state was 10.7 L/h in a child weighing 9.8 kg co-treated with lopinavir/ritonavir, and was 12% higher in children receiving efavirenz. During co-administration of rifampicin-based antituberculosis treatment and super-boosted lopinavir in a 1:1 ratio with ritonavir, abacavir exposure decreased by 29.4%. Malnourished children living with HIV had higher abacavir exposure initially, but this effect waned with nutritional rehabilitation. An additional 18.4% reduction in clearance after the first abacavir dose was described, suggesting induction of clearance with time on lopinavir/ritonavir-based therapy. Finally, absorption of the fixed dose combination tablet was 24% slower than the abacavir liquid formulation.\nIn this pooled analysis we found that children on lopinavir/ritonavir or efavirenz had similar abacavir exposures, while concomitant TB treatment and super-boosted lopinavir gave significantly reduced abacavir concentrations.', 'Both prevalence and clinical features of the various movement disorders in adults with primary mitochondrial diseases are unknown.\nBased on the database of the "Nation-wide Italian Collaborative Network of Mitochondrial Diseases", we reviewed the clinical, genetic, neuroimaging and neurophysiological data of adult patients with primary mitochondrial diseases (n\u2009=\u2009764) where ataxia, myoclonus or other movement disorders were part of the clinical phenotype.\nAtaxia, myoclonus and movement disorders were present in 105/764 adults (13.7%), with the onset coinciding or preceding the diagnosis of the mitochondrial disease in 49/105 (46.7%). Ataxia and parkinsonism were the most represented, with an overall prevalence at last follow-up of 59.1% and 30.5%, respectively. Hyperkinetic movement disorders were reported in 15.3% at last follow-up, being the less common reported movement disorders. The pathogenic m.8344A\u2009>\u2009G and POLG variants were always associated with a movement disorder, while LHON variants and mtDNA single deletions were more commonly found in the subjects who did not present a movement disorder. The most common neuroimaging features were cortical and/or cerebellar atrophy, white matter hyperintensities, basal ganglia abnormalities and nigro-striatal degeneration. Almost 70% of patients with parkinsonism responded to dopaminergic therapy, mainly levodopa, and 50% with myoclonus were successfully treated with levetiracetam.\nMovement disorders, mainly ataxia and parkinsonism, are important findings in adult primary mitochondrial diseases. This study underlies the importance of looking for a mitochondrial etiology in the diagnostic flowchart of a movement disorder and may help direct genetic screening in daily practice.', "Calcium dysregulation has been proposed to play a causative role in the development of Alzheimer's disease pathology. Pregabalin is a compound already approved for human use, marketed as the prescription drug Lyrica. It binds the α2-δ subunit of P/Q-type voltage gated calcium channels, lowering calcium influx and providing effective treatment for epilepsy and neuropathic pain.\nWe hypothesize that increased resting calcium in neuronal processes near amyloid plaques plays a role in the development of neuritic dystrophies and further progression of amyloid pathology.\n5XFAD mice were treated orally for 12 weeks with pregabalin, then immunoblotting and immunofluorescent imaging were used to quantify neuritic dystrophy and amyloid deposition in pregabalin compared to placebo-treated mice.\nThe treatment did not decrease markers of neuritic dystrophy or amyloid deposition. The image analysis of neuritic dystrophy on a plaque-by-plaque basis showed a small non-significant increase in the relative proportion of LAMP1 to Aβ42 in plaques with areas of 50 -450 μm2 in the cortex of pregabalin-treated mice. In addition, there was a statistically significant positive correlation between the measured cerebral concentration of pregabalin and the relative levels of BACE1 and Aβ in the cortex. This relationship was not observed in the hippocampus, and there was no increase in average Aβ levels in pregabalin treated mice compared to placebo. We confirmed previous findings that smaller amyloid plaques are associated with a greater degree of neuritic dystrophy.\nPregabalin may have an effect on Aβ that merits further investigation, but our study does not suggest that pregabalin contributes substantially to amyloid pathology.", 'Cognitive impairment is a core aspect of psychotic disorders and difficult to treat. Atypical antipsychotics (AAs) might have differential effects on cognitive impairment, but rigid study designs and selective sampling limit the generalizability of existing findings. This pragmatic, semi-randomized, industry-independent study aimed to investigate and compare the effect of amisulpride, aripiprazole and olanzapine on cognitive performance in psychosis over a 12-month period controlling for diagnostic group. This sub study of the BeSt InTro study recruited adults with ongoing psychosis in the schizophrenia spectrum of disorders (ICD-10 diagnoses F20-F23, F25, F28 or F29; ', "Internal carotid artery (ICA) dissection is a cause of stroke, but it is often underdiagnosed in children. ICAs' risk factors and pathogenic mechanisms are poorly understood, and the treatment is still empirical. We report the case of a previously healthy 9-year-old girl who presented with involuntary hypertonic closure of the right hand associated with transient difficulty for both fine movements of the right arm and speech. She had a history of minor cervical trauma occurring 20 days prior to our observation without other associated risk factors. Magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiography showed ischemic lesions due to the left ICA dissection. Treatment with both acetylsalicylic acid and levetiracetam allowed recanalization of the ICA associated with the resolution of clinical signs. Our clinical case suggests that the ICA dissection must be suspected early whenever a child manifests mild neurologic deficits after a cervical trauma, especially if they are associated with headache and/or cervical pain. Moreover, the management of ICA dissection must be improved.", 'Time-to-fall off an accelerating rotating rod (rotarod) is widely utilized to evaluate rodent motor performance. We reasoned that this simple outcome could be refined with additional measures explicit in the task (however inconspicuously) to examine what we call movement sub-structure. Our goal was to characterize normal variation or motor impairment more robustly than by using time-to-fall. We also hypothesized that measures (or features) early in the sub-structure could anticipate the learning expected of a mouse undergoing serial trials. Using normal untreated and baclofen-treated movement-impaired\xa0mice, we defined these features and automated their analysis using paw video-tracking in three consecutive trials, including paw location, speed, acceleration, variance and approximate entropy. Spectral arc length yielded speed and acceleration uniformity. We found that, in normal mice, paw movement smoothness inversely correlated with rotarod time-to-fall for the three trials. Greater approximate entropy in vertical movements, and opposite changes in horizontal movements, correlated with greater first-trial time-to-fall. First-trial horizontal approximate entropy in the first few seconds predicted subsequent time-to-fall. This allowed for the separation, after only one rotarod trial, of different-weight, untreated mouse groups, and for the detection of mice otherwise unimpaired after baclofen, which displayed a time-to-fall similar to control. A machine-learning support vector machine classifier corroborated these findings. In conclusion, time-to-fall off a rotarod correlated well with several measures, including some obtained during the first few seconds of a trial, and some responsive to learning over the first two trials, allowing for predictions or preemptive experimental manipulations before learning completion.', 'Analgesic medications are commonly prescribed in pediatrics, with prescribing practices frequently extrapolated from adult trials. Gabapentinoids (gabapentin and pregabalin) are widely used as analgesics but are labeled in pediatrics only for epilepsy. We aim to (1) define trends in pediatric gabapentinoid prescribing (label and off-label) over 7 years, and (2) evaluate use in chronic pain clinic (CPC) patients during 2018.\nRetrospective data from a tertiary-care pediatric hospital were collected between 2013 and 2019. Annual numbers of gabapentinoid prescriptions were stratified by prescriber specialty. Additional information about gabapentinoid prescribing in the CPC was manually collected from initial clinic notes in 2018.\nThere were 15\u2009808 outpatient prescriptions for gabapentinoids among 5172 patients over 7 years. Of these, 93% were gabapentin and 7% were pregabalin. Numbers of patients receiving gabapentin and pregabalin prescriptions increased by 1.4- and 1.3-fold, respectively, between 2013 and 2019. Few prescriptions were done for patients with a previous epilepsy diagnosis (in 2019, 16% for gabapentin and 13% for pregabalin). Approximately 28% of 650 CPC new patients were prescribed gabapentin or pregabalin before referral. Among those, 44% had discontinued the medication because of adverse events (35%), inefficacy (46%), or both (5%). Most side effects reported were mild to moderate. Diagnoses at first visit were diverse, not limited to neuropathic pain conditions, and did not differ between patients receiving or not receiving gabapentinoid prescriptions.\nIn our hospital, gabapentinoids are commonly prescribed off-label for diverse indications, including chronic pain. Future research is needed to evaluate gabapentinoid efficacy in these indications.', 'Seizures occur in around 13% of patients with cancer and can be distressing for family members to witness. In those unable to manage regular antiepileptic medications, midazolam can be administered subcutaneously using a syringe driver, but this may cause sedation. Brivaracetam is a newer drug licensed as an adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalisation and for restricted use in those with refractory epilepsy. It is associated with fewer behavioural or psychiatric side effects than levetiracetam, has a very low incidence of drug interactions and the maximal dose can be accommodated in a single syringe driver. We present three cases from 2019 to 2020 where subcutaneous brivaracetam has been successfully used in a Specialist Inpatient Palliative Care setting to manage seizures. Brivaracetam dosing is 1:1 conversion from oral:subcutaneous, with syringe driver doses ranging from 150 mg to 300 mg/24 hours being successfully used, with no adverse effects observed.', 'A new sustained-release (SR) pregabalin formulation (YHD1119) designed for once-daily dosing has recently been developed to improve patient adherence. This study aimed to compare the pharmacokinetics of pregabalin SR and immediate-release (IR) formulations after multiple oral doses and to assess the effect of food on the pharmacokinetic profile of the pregabalin SR formulation after a single dose in healthy individuals.\nTwo clinical trials were conducted: a randomized, open-label, multiple-dose, 2-treatment, 2-period crossover study to evaluate the steady-state pharmacokinetic properties of SR treatment (pregabalin SR 300 mg once daily for 3 days) and IR treatment (pregabalin IR 150 mg twice daily for 3 days) under fed conditions and a randomized, open-label, single-dose, 2-treatment, 2-period, crossover study to evaluate the effect of food intake on the pharmacokinetic properties of the pregabalin SR formulation. Plasma concentrations of pregabalin were measured using LC-MS/MS. The AUC and C\nThirty-one individuals in the bioequivalence study and 23 in the food effect study completed the pharmacokinetic sampling. The geometric mean ratios of C\nThe bioavailability of the pregabalin SR 300 mg formulation is increased if taken with a high-fat meal. Once-daily pregabalin SR 300 mg is bioequivalent to twice-daily pregabalin IR 150 mg under fed conditions at steady state. The pregabalin SR formulation is expected to improve patient adherence. ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers: NCT02783183 (bioequivalence study) and NCT03191136 (food effect study).', "Although gabapentin has demonstrated efficacy in mitigating alcohol withdrawal symptoms and preventing relapse drinking in individuals with alcohol use disorder (AUD), the neurobiological mechanisms of action underlying these therapeutic effects remain unknown. The present study evaluated changes in GABA and glutamate levels in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) as candidate mechanisms of action.\nIn a 16-week randomized clinical trial, 68 adults with AUD, including a history of alcohol withdrawal syndrome, received 1,200 mg/day of gabapentin (N=37) or placebo (N=31) and nine medical management visits after ≥72 hours of abstinence. Proton MR spectroscopy (\nThe effects of gabapentin on GABA and glutamate levels were significantly associated with participants' percent days abstinent during early treatment. Specifically, gabapentin was associated with greater increases in glutamate and greater decreases in GABA levels in participants who remained mostly or entirely abstinent, and yet the opposite in participants who drank on more than half of the days preceding the second scan. Furthermore, gabapentin-treated participants with greater increases in glutamate levels during early treatment had significantly more percent days abstinent across the remainder of the study, relative to placebo-treated participants.\nIn addition to providing insight into the mechanisms through which gabapentin may promote abstinence in individuals with AUD, this study also provides evidence for a biomarker of efficacious treatment that may be used to evaluate other glutamatergic or GABAergic medications for AUD and related conditions.", 'Effectiveness of antipsychotic drugs is inferred from relatively small randomized clinical trials conducted with carefully selected and monitored participants. This evidence is not necessarily generalizable to individuals treated in daily clinical practice. The authors compared the clinical effectiveness between all oral and long-acting injectable (LAI) antipsychotic medications used in the treatment of schizophrenia in the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health care system.\nThis was an observational study utilizing VA pharmacy data from 37,368 outpatient veterans with schizophrenia. Outcome measures were all-cause antipsychotic discontinuation and psychiatric hospitalizations. Oral olanzapine was used as the reference group.\nIn multivariable analysis, clozapine (hazard ratio=0.43), aripiprazole long-acting injectable (LAI) (hazard ratio=0.71), paliperidone LAI (hazard ratio=0.76), antipsychotic polypharmacy (hazard ratio=0.77), and risperidone LAI (hazard ratio=0.91) were associated with reduced hazard of discontinuation compared with oral olanzapine. Oral first-generation antipsychotics (hazard ratio=1.16), oral risperidone (hazard ratio=1.15), oral aripiprazole (hazard ratio=1.14), oral ziprasidone (hazard ratio=1.13), and oral quetiapine (hazard ratio=1.11) were significantly associated with an increased risk of discontinuation compared with oral olanzapine. No treatment showed reduced risk of psychiatric hospitalization compared with oral olanzapine; quetiapine was associated with a 36% worse outcome in terms of hospitalizations compared with olanzapine.\nIn a national sample of veterans with schizophrenia, those treated with clozapine, two of the LAI second-generation antipsychotics, and antipsychotic polypharmacy continued the same antipsychotic therapy for a longer period of time compared with the reference drug. This may reflect greater overall acceptability of these medications in clinical practice.', 'Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes serious lower respiratory tract infections. Currently, the only clinical anti-RSV drug is ribavirin, but ribavirin has serious toxic side effect and can only be used by critically ill patients. A series of benzimidazole derivatives were synthesized starting from 1,4:3,6-dianhydro-d-fructose and a variety of o-phenylenediamines. Evaluation of their antiviral activity showed that compound a27 had the highest antiviral activity with a half maximal effective concentration (EC', 'The present work focuses on the ecotoxicological effects of montelukast sodium (MTL) and its photoproducts, obtained under environmentally-like conditions. Despite of the potential presence in surface waters and the common use of MTL as asthma drug, limited data has been published for its photodegradation, while no information is available for its ecotoxicity. Light-induced degradation is an effective way for drugs to degrade in aquatic environments, and MTL is highly photosensitive, even by exposure to sunlight. In this study, solar-simulated irradiation of the drug in water was investigated. The drug was quickly converted into a series of photoproducts that were spectroscopically characterized. The possible photoreaction pathways were proposed. Ecotoxicity tests were performed on parent compound and mixture of photoproducts towards two bioindicators (Raphidocelis subcapitata and Daphnia magna). Results evidenced that effects of MTL on D. magna (EC50\u202f=\u202f16.4\u202fmg/L) were greater than effects on R. subcapitata (EC50\u202f=\u202f195.7\u202fmg/L). Microscopy observations revealed that MTL had mainly accumulated in the gut of daphnia. Toxicity data on photolysed solutions highlighted the presence of residual toxicity in all samples, evidencing that no complete mineralization occurred. Future research should focus on monitoring of MTL concentrations in the environment and study its effects in bioaccumulation tests.', 'Real-world studies assessing the effectiveness and safety of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir (SOF/VEL) plus ribavirin (RBV) for Child-Pugh B/C hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related cirrhosis are limited.\nWe included 107 patients with Child-Pugh B/C HCV-related cirrhosis receiving SOF/VEL plus RBV for 12 weeks in Taiwan. The sustained virologic response rates at off-treatment week 12 (SVR12) for the evaluable population (EP), modified EP, and per-protocol population (PP) were assessed. The safety profiles were reported.\nThe SVR12 rates in the EP, modified EP and PP were 89.7% (95% confidence interval (CI): 82.5%-94.2%), 94.1% (95% CI: 87.8%-97.3%), and 100% (96 of 96 patients; 95% CI: 96.2%-100%). No patients who failed to achieve SVR12 were attributed to virologic failures. The SVR12 rates were comparable regardless of patient characteristics. One patient discontinued treatment because of adverse events (AEs). Twenty-four patients had serious AEs and six died, but none were related to SOF/VEL or RBV. Among the 96 patients achieving SVR12, 84.4% and 64.6% had improved Child-Pugh and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) scores. Multivariate analysis revealed that a baseline MELD score ≥ 15 was associated with an improved MELD score of ≥ 3 (odds ratio (OR): 4.13, 95% CI: 1.16-14.71; p = 0.02). Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 1 had more significant estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) declines than patients with CKD stage 2 (-0.42 mL/min/1.73m2/month; p = 0.01) or stage 3 (-0.56 mL/min/1.73m2/month; p < 0.001).\nSOF/VEL plus RBV for 12 weeks is efficacious and well-tolerated for Child-Pugh B/C HCV-related cirrhosis.', "Neurological complications of COVID-19, including delirium, are emerging in the adult population but have not been well described in pediatrics.\nWe report the cases of 2 adolescent males, ages 16 and 17, who presented with delirium secondary to an acute COVID-19 infection in the fall of 2020 at Children's Wisconsin in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The foundation of our treatment strategy was the triad of alpha-2 agonists (clonidine, dexmedetomidine, guanfacine), antipsychotic agents (quetiapine, haloperidol, olanzapine), and melatonin. Discharge planning required involvement from inpatient psychiatry, case management, social work, and the family. Both patients showed improvement after several weeks.\nWe believe these are the first reported cases of COVID-19-associated delirium in children outside of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C).\nPediatric COVID-19 delirium is a new manifestation of the COVID-19 disease. Treatment guidelines are emerging and lessons regarding therapies and discharge considerations are described in these 2 unique cases.", "Multiple direct-acting antiviral (DAA) regimens are available to treat hepatitis C virus (HCV), genotype 1 infection. However, comparative effectiveness from randomized controlled trials of DAA regimens is unavailable. Approach & Results We conducted a pragmatic randomized controlled trial (NCT02786537) to compare the effectiveness of DAAs for HCV genotype 1a or 1b on viral response, safety, tolerability, and medication non-adherence. Adults with compensated liver disease, HCV genotype 1, not pregnant or breast feeding, and with health insurance likely to cover ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (LDV/SOF) were recruited from 34 U.S. viral hepatitis clinics. Participants were randomized (± ribavirin) to ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (LDV/SOF), elbasvir/grazoprevir (EBR/GZR), and paritaprevir/ritonavir/ombitasvir+dasabuvir (PrOD, treatment arm stopped early). Primary outcomes included sustained viral response at 12 weeks (SVR12), clinician-recorded adverse events, patient-reported symptoms, and medication non-adherence. Between June 2016 and March 2018, 1609 participants were randomized. Among 1128 participants who received ≥ 1 dose of EBR/GZR or LDV/SOF (± ribavirin), SVR12 were 95.2% [95% CI, 92.8 to 97.6] and 97.4% [95% CI, 95.5 to 99.2] respectively, with a difference estimate of 2.2% [ -0.5, 4.7%], falling within the 'equivalence' interval [-5,\xa05%]. While most (56%) participants experienced adverse events, few were serious (4.2%) or severe (1.8%). In the absence of ribavirin, discontinuations due to adverse events were rare. Patient-reported symptoms and medication non-adherence were similar. Study limitations were drop-out due to insurance denial and lost to follow-up after treatment, limiting the ability to measure SVR12.\nThis pragmatic trial demonstrated high SVR12 for participants treated with EBR/GZR and LDV/SOF with few adverse effects. Overall, the two regimens were equivalent in effectiveness. The results support current HCV guidelines that do not distinguish between ribavirin-free EBR/GZR or LDV/SOF.", 'To characterize the population pharmacokinetics of lamotrigine in Jordanian epileptic patients and to identify factors affecting therapeutic parameters.\nA population pharmacokinetics model for lamotrigine was established based on a prospectively collected data of 52 steady-state concentrations from 38 adult and pediatric patients with epilepsy. Lamotrigine concentrations were determined by a dried blood spot liquid chromatography method. Data were analyzed according to a one-compartment model with first-order absorption and elimination using the nonlinear mixed effect modeling program. The covariates effect of total body weight, gender, age, and co-medication with topiramate, carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, and valproic acid on lamotrigine clearance were investigated using a stepwise forward addition followed by a stepwise backward elimination.\nThe final population pharmacokinetics model for lamotrigine clearance was as follows: CL/F\nLamotrigine total clearance in the Jordanian patients is comparable to that reported by others for Caucasian patients. Age and concomitant therapy with carbamazepine and valproic acid significantly affected lamotrigine clearance, and accounted for 48% of its inter-individual variability.', 'Sodium-glucose transporters (SGLTs) are important targets for therapeutic intervention of type 2 diabetes. This study aims to evaluate the physiological influences of diabetes mellitus and the potential impacts of metformin and fluoxetine on SGLTs expressions.\nAlterations of SGLT1 and SGLT2 were measured in organs involved in glucose homeostasis (kidney, intestine, liver and pancreas) of streptozotocin (STZ) and high-fat diet (HFD) induced diabetic mice by western blotting and real-time PCR (RT-PCR) respectively.\nIn kidney, duodenal segments of intestine, liver, and pancreas of HFD diabetic mice, expressions of SGLT2 were all elevated compared to control mice. The level of SGLT1 was significantly increased in intestine, but was decreased in pancreas. SGLT1 expression in kidney was unaffected, and SGLT1 was undetectable in hepatocytes. Similar results were obtained in STZ diabetic mice. More importantly, here we noticed metformin decreased levels of SGLT2 in kidney, intestine, and pancreas of HFD mice markedly. Expressions of SGLT1 in intestine and pancreas were reduced by metformin as well. In contrast, fluoxetine increased abundances of SGLT2 and SGLT1 in kidney of HFD mice, but decreased SGLT1 expression in intestine.\nThe present study provided evidence that expressions of SGLT1 and SGLT2 were significantly modulated by diabetes mellitus as well as by metformin and fluoxetine, which indicated the efficacy of SGLT2 inhibitors might be impacted by these factors.', "The clinical efficacy of antiobesity medications (AOMs) as adjuncts to lifestyle intervention is well characterized, but data regarding their use in conjunction with workplace wellness plans are lacking, and coverage of AOMs by US private employers is limited.\nTo determine the effect of combining AOMs with a comprehensive, interdisciplinary, employer-based weight management program (WMP) compared with the WMP alone on weight loss, treatment adherence, and work productivity and limitations.\nThis 1-year, single-center, open-label, parallel-group, real-world, randomized clinical trial was conducted at the Cleveland Clinic's Endocrinology and Metabolism Institute in Cleveland, Ohio, from January 7, 2019, to May 22, 2020. Participants were adults with obesity (body mass index [BMI; calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared] ≥30) enrolled in the Cleveland Clinic Employee Health Plan.\nIn total, 200 participants were randomized 1:1, 100 participants to WMP combined with an AOM (WMP+Rx), and 100 participants to WMP alone. The WMP was the Cleveland Clinic Endocrinology and Metabolism Institute's employer-based integrated medical WMP implemented through monthly multidisciplinary shared medical appointments. Participants in the WMP+Rx group initiated treatment with 1 of 5 US Food and Drug Administration-approved medications for chronic weight management (orlistat, lorcaserin, phentermine/topiramate, naltrexone/bupropion, and liraglutide, 3.0 mg) according to standard clinical practice.\nThe primary end point was the percentage change in body weight from baseline to month 12.\nThe 200 participants were predominately (177 of 200 [88.5%]) women, had a mean (SD) age of 50.0 (10.3) years, and a mean (SD) baseline weight of 105.0 (19.0) kg. For the primary intention-to-treat estimand, the estimated mean (SE) weight loss was -7.7% (0.7%) for the WMP+Rx group vs -4.2% (0.7%) for the WMP group, with an estimated treatment difference of -3.5% (95% CI, -5.5% to -1.5%) (P\u2009<\u2009.001). The estimated percentage of participants achieving at least 5% weight loss was 62.5% for WMP+Rx vs 44.8% for WMP (P\u2009=\u2009.02). The rate of attendance at shared medical appointments was higher for the WMP+Rx group than for the WMP group. No meaningful differences in patient-reported work productivity or limitation measures were observed.\nClinically meaningful superior mean weight loss was achieved when access to AOMs was provided in the real-world setting of an employer-based WMP, compared with the WMP alone. Such results may inform employer decisions regarding AOM coverage and guide best practices for comprehensive, interdisciplinary employer-based WMPs.\nClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03799198.", 'There is limited information about trends in the treatment of opioid use disorder (OUD) among Medicaid enrollees.\nTo examine the use of medications for OUD and potential indicators of quality of care in multiple states.\nExploratory serial cross-sectional study of 1\u202f024\u202f301 Medicaid enrollees in 11 states aged 12 through 64 years (not eligible for Medicare) with International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9 or ICD-10) codes for OUD from 2014 through 2018. Each state used generalized estimating equations to estimate associations between enrollee characteristics and outcome measure prevalence, subsequently pooled to generate global estimates using random effects meta-analyses.\nCalendar year, demographic characteristics, eligibility groups, and comorbidities.\nUse of medications for OUD (buprenorphine, methadone, or naltrexone); potential indicators of good quality (OUD medication continuity for 180 days, behavioral health counseling, urine drug tests); potential indicators of poor quality (prescribing of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines).\nIn 2018, 41.7% of Medicaid enrollees with OUD were aged 21 through 34 years, 51.2% were female, 76.1% were non-Hispanic White, 50.7% were eligible through Medicaid expansion, and 50.6% had other substance use disorders. Prevalence of OUD increased in these 11 states from 3.3% (290\u202f628 of 8\u202f737\u202f082) in 2014 to 5.0% (527\u202f983 of 10\u202f585\u202f790) in 2018. The pooled prevalence of enrollees with OUD receiving medication treatment increased from 47.8% in 2014 (range across states, 35.3% to 74.5%) to 57.1% in 2018 (range, 45.7% to 71.7%). The overall prevalence of enrollees receiving 180 days of continuous medications for OUD did not significantly change from the 2014-2015 to 2017-2018 periods (-0.01 prevalence difference, 95% CI, -0.03 to 0.02) with state variability in trend (90% prediction interval, -0.08 to 0.06). Non-Hispanic Black enrollees had lower OUD medication use than White enrollees (prevalence ratio [PR], 0.72; 95% CI, 0.64 to 0.81; P\u2009<\u2009.001; 90% prediction interval, 0.52 to 1.00).

On March 11, 2020 COVID-19 outbreak was officially declared as pandemic by World Health Organization (WHO). Entire world united to fight back against this ultimate destruction. Around 90 vaccines are featured against SARS-CoV-2 and more than 300 active clinical trials are underway by several groups and individuals. So far, no drugs are currently approved that completely eliminates the deadly corona virus. The promising SARS-CoV-2 anti-viral drugs are favipiravir, remdesivir, lopinavir, ribavirin and avifavir. In this review, we have discussed the synthetic approaches elaborately made so far by different groups and chemical companies all around the world towards top three convincing anti-viral drugs against SARS-CoV-2 which are favipiravir, remdesivir and lopinavir.', 'Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are among the most common causes of severe delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms(DRESS) in children. These reactions are more commonly seen with aromatic AEDs such as phenytoin and carbamazepine than the non-aromatic or new generation AEDs. However immediate-type hypersensitivity reactions such as urticaria/angioedema, anaphylaxis are very rare with AEDs.\nLevetiracetam is an increasingly used new non-aromatic antiepileptic drug and reported to have a better safety profile in daily practice. We present the first adolescent case who developed an anaphylactic reaction with intravenous levetiracetam, not reported in this age group before in the literature.\nHypersensitivity reactions in the form of anaphylaxis can be rarely observed with new generation AEDs. Therefore, when any antiepileptic drug is started on any patient, immediate type serious reactions such as anaphylaxis should be kept in mind, not only focusing on delayed reactions such as SJS, TEN,or DRESS.', 'Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms usually impairs academic achievement and can trigger the onset of medication. Methylphenidate is a drug widely prescribed to treat ADHD. However, systematic reviews of randomized clinical trials suggest that it does not lead to great improvements in academic performance. Thus, we aimed to evaluate the evidence on the "real-world" effectiveness of methylphenidate in improving the academic achievement of ADHD students.\nWe conducted a systematic review of observational studies retrieved from five electronic databases, besides a manual search and search in grey literature. Studies evaluating treatment with methylphenidate compared to no treatment or other pharmacological/non-pharmacological alternatives used in ADHD were included. The risk of bias of the selected studies was assessed using adapted versions of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale.\nNine studies (from ten reports) were included in the review: four cohorts, two before-and-after designs and three cross-sectional studies. They involved 12,269 children and adolescents aged 6-18\xa0years. The doses of methylphenidate ranged from 10 to 72\xa0mg/day, and the duration of the treatment from 2.6\xa0months to 4.25\xa0years. Five of these studies concluded that methylphenidate improves academic performance. However, three of the four lowest-bias risk studies concluded that the drug is ineffective. Five studies assessed the long-term use of methylphenidate, and four of them concluded that it does not result in better outcomes in the school setting. Most included studies had considerable limitations and significant heterogeneity regarding methodological design and academic performance measurement criteria.\nAlthough some studies indicate that the short-term use of methylphenidate may improve outcomes in the school environment, the available evidence does not support the establishment of adequate conclusions about the real benefits of methylphenidate in the academic improvement of ADHD students.', 'Topical treatment of various skin disorders requires drug absorption and penetration through the stratum corneum (SC) into the epidermis and dermis tissues. The use of nano-drug delivery systems including liposomes and lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) have been shown to facilitate SC penetration. The goal of this work was to study the impact of liposome sizes and the resulted drug distribution inside various skin tissue.\nAll trans retinoic acid (ATRA) was used as the model drug and loaded into gel phase HSPC/CHOL/DSPE-PEG liposomes (lipo-ATRA) with sizes ranging from 80\xa0nm to more than 300\xa0nm. The percutaneous drug absorption process was monitored and analyzed.\nThere were significant differences in percutaneous absorption and tissue distribution resulted from liposomes smaller than 100\xa0nm and those bigger than 200\xa0nm. Lipo-ATRA with a mean diameter of 83\xa0nm can deliver the content to epidermis and dermis. But for 200\xa0nm - 300\xa0nm liposomes, the resulted epidermis and dermis ATRA levels were less than about one third, suggesting bigger liposomes had poor penetration through the brick and mortar structure of SC.\nGel phase liposomes with sizes under 100\xa0nm improved encapsulated drug absorption and distribution into the epidermis and dermis tissues. A size dependent mechanism for liposome penetration of the stratum corneum was proposed.', 'Gabapentinoids are effective drugs in most animal models of pain and inflammation with variable effects in humans. The current study evaluated the pharmacological activity of gabapentin (GBP) and its salicylaldehyde derivative (gabapentsal; [2-(1-(((2-hydroxybenzylidene) amino) methyl) cyclohexyl) acetic acid]; GPS) in well-established mouse models of nociceptive pain, inflammatory edema, and pyrexia at doses of 25-100 mg/kg. GPS allayed tonic visceral pain as reflected by acetic acid-induced nociception and it also diminished thermally induced nociception as a mimic of phasic thermal pain. Antagonism of GPS-induced antinociceptive activities by naloxone (NLX, 1.0 mg/kg, subcutaneously, s.c), beta-funaltrexamine (β-FNT, 5.0 mg/kg, s.c), naltrindole (NT, 1.0 mg/kg, s.c), and nor-binaltorphimine (NOR-BNI, 5.0 mg/kg, s.c), and pentylenetetrazole (PTZ-15 mg/kg, intraperitoneally, i.p) implicated an involvement of both opioidergic and GABAergic mechanisms. Tail immersion test was conducted in order to delineate the mechanistic insights of antinociceptive response. Inflammatory edema induced by carrageenan, histamine, or serotonin was also effectively reversed by GPS in a fashion analogous to aspirin (150 mg/kg, i.p), chlorpheniramine (1.0 mg/kg, i.p), and mianserin (1.0 mg/kg, i.p), respectively. Additionally, yeast-induced pyrexia was decreased by GPS in a comparable manner to acetaminophen (50 mg/kg, i.p). These observations suggest that GPS possesses ameliorative properties in tonic, phasic, and tail immersion tests of nociception via opioidergic and GABAergic mechanisms, curbs inflammatory edema, and is antipyretic in nature.', 'Nicotine, a major component of tobacco, is highly addictive and acts on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) to stimulate reward-associated circuits in the brain. It is well known that nAChRs play critical roles in mediating nicotine reward and addiction. Current FDA-approved medications for smoking cessation are the antidepressant bupropion and the nicotinic partial agonist varenicline, yet both are limited by adverse side effects and moderate efficacy. Thus, development of more efficacious medications with fewer side effects for nicotine addiction and smoking cessation is urgently needed. l-Tetrahydropalmatine (l-THP) is an active ingredient of the Chinese medicinal herb Corydalis ambigua that possesses rich neuropharmacological actions on dopamine (DA) receptors in the mesocorticolimbic dopaminergic reward pathway. L-THP has been explored as anti-addiction treatments for drug abuse including nicotine. However, the targets and mechanisms of l-THP-caused anti-nicotine effects are largely unknown. In this study we address this question by elucidating the effects of l-THP on human neuronal nAChRs using patch-clamp recordings. Human neuronal α4β2-nAChRs were heterologously expressed in SH-EP1 human epithelial cells. Bath application of nicotine (0.1-100\u2009μM) induced inward currents, co-application of l-THP (3\u2009μM) inhibited nicotine-induced currents in the transfected cells. L-THP-caused inhibition was concentration-dependent (the EC', 'Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an incapacitating trauma-related disorder, with no reliable therapy. Although PTSD has been associated with epigenetic alterations in peripheral white blood cells, it is unknown where such changes occur in the brain, and whether they play a causal role in PTSD. Using an animal PTSD model, we show distinct DNA methylation profiles of PTSD susceptibility in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Data analysis revealed overall hypomethylation of different genomic CG sites in susceptible animals. This was correlated with the reduction in expression levels of the DNA methyltransferase, DNMT3a. Since epigenetic changes in diseases involve different gene pathways, rather than single candidate genes, we next searched for pathways that may be involved in PTSD. Analysis of differentially methylated sites identified enrichment in the RAR activation and LXR/RXR activation pathways that regulate Retinoic Acid Receptor (RAR) Related Orphan Receptor A (RORA) activation. Intra-NAc injection of a lentiviral vector expressing either RORA or DNMT3a reversed PTSD-like behaviors while knockdown of RORA and DNMT3a increased PTSD-like behaviors. To translate our results into a potential pharmacological therapeutic strategy, we tested the effect of systemic treatment with the global methyl donor S-adenosyl methionine (SAM), for supplementing DNA methylation, or retinoic acid, for activating RORA downstream pathways. We found that combined treatment with the methyl donor SAM and retinoic acid reversed PTSD-like behaviors. Thus, our data point to a novel approach to the treatment of PTSD, which is potentially translatable to humans.', "Retinoids play a pivotal role in adrenal development and differentiation. Recent clinical trials revealed therapeutic potential of both all-trans and 9-cis retinoic acid in patients with cortisol excess due to a pituitary ACTH-secreting adenoma and indicated that retinoids might act also on the adrenal. Aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of 9-cis retinoic acid on adrenals from patients with ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome. Adrenal specimens from six patients with Cushing's disease were incubated with 10\xa0nM-1\xa0µM 9-cis retinoic acid with and without 10\xa0nM ACTH. Cortisol secretion was measured by immunoassay and expression of genes involved in steroidogenesis as well as retinoic acid action were evaluated by real-time RT-PCR. Incubation with 10-100\xa0nM 9-cis retinoic acid increased spontaneous cortisol secretion and expression of STAR and CYP17A. On the other hand, in wells treated with ACTH, 9-cis retinoic acid markedly diminished ACTH receptor upregulation and no stimulatory effect on cortisol secretion or steroidogenic enzyme synthesis was observed. ACTH itself increased ligand-induced retinoic acid receptor expression, possibly enhancing sensitivity to retinoic acid. Our findings indicate that the effect of 9-cis retinoic acid in presence of ACTH is distinct from unchallenged wells and support the hypothesis of a direct adrenal action in patients with Cushing's disease.", 'Long-term recurrent stress is a common cause of neuropsychiatric disorders. Animal models are widely used to study the pathogenesis of stress-related psychiatric disorders. The zebrafish (Danio rerio) is emerging as a powerful tool to study chronic stress and its mechanisms. Here, we developed a prolonged 11-week\xa0chronic unpredictable stress (PCUS) model in zebrafish to\xa0more fully mimic chronic stress in human populations. We also\xa0examined behavioral and neurochemical alterations in zebrafish, and attempted to modulate these states by 3-week treatment with an antidepressant\xa0fluoxetine, a neuroprotective omega-3\xa0polyunsaturated fatty acid\xa0eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), a pro-inflammatory endotoxin\xa0lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and their combinations. Overall, PCUS induced severe anxiety and elevated norepinephrine levels, whereas fluoxetine (alone or combined with other agents) corrected most of these behavioral deficits. While EPA and LPS alone had little effects on the zebrafish PCUS-induced anxiety behavior, both fluoxetine (alone or in combination) and EPA restored norepinephrine levels, whereas LPS\u2009+\u2009EPA increased dopamine levels. As these data support the validity of PCUS as an effective tool to study stress-related pathologies in zebrafish, further research is needed into the ability of various conventional and novel treatments to modulate behavioral and neurochemical biomarkers of chronic stress in this model organism.', 'Spasticity is present in more than 80% of the population with cerebral palsy (CP). The aim of this study was to describe and compare the use of three spasticity reducing methods; Botulinum toxin-A therapy (BTX-A), Selective dorsal rhizotomy (SDR) and Intrathecal baclofen therapy (ITB) among children and adolescents with CP in six northern European countries.\nThis registry-based study included population-based data in children and adolescents with CP born 2002 to 2017 and recorded in the follow-up programs for CP in Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Iceland and Scotland, and a defined cohort in Finland.\nA total of 8,817 individuals were included. The proportion of individuals treated with SDR and ITB was significantly different between the countries. SDR treatment ranged from 0% ( Finland and Iceland) to 3.4% (Scotland) and ITB treatment from 2.2% (Sweden) to 3.7% (Denmark and Scotland). BTX-A treatment in the lower extremities reported 2017-2018 ranged from 8.6% in Denmark to 20% in Norway (p\u2009<\u20090.01). Mean age for undergoing SDR ranged from 4.5\xa0years in Norway to 7.3\xa0years in Denmark (p\u2009<\u20090.01). Mean age at ITB surgery ranged from 6.3\xa0years in Norway to 10.1\xa0years in Finland (p\u2009<\u20090.01). Mean age for BTX-A treatment ranged from 7.1\xa0years in Denmark to 10.3\xa0years in Iceland (p\u2009<\u20090.01). Treatment with SDR was most common in Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) level III, ITB in level V, and BTX-A in level I. The most common muscle treated with BTX-A was the calf muscle, with the highest proportion in GMFCS level I. BTX-A treatment of hamstring and hip muscles was most common in GMFCS levels IV-V in all countries.\nThere were statistically significant differences between countries regarding the proportion of children and adolescents with CP treated with the three spasticity reducing methods, mean age for treatment and treatment related to GMFCS level. This is likely due to differences in the availability of these treatment methods and/or differences in preferences of treatment methods among professionals and possibly patients across countries.', 'There are many contradictory studies that dealt with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recurrence rate of well ablated hepatitis C virus (HCV) related HCC. We aim to assess the recurrence rate of previously ablated HCC in patients who received direct acting antiviral (DAA) for their HCV.\nThis is a retrospective data analysis of 523 HCV patients who have a history of successfully ablated HCC and eligible for HCV treatment. Retrieval was done to demographic/clinical data, HCV pretreatment investigations, HCV treatment outcome. Follow up for survival and HCC recurrence was done every 3 months using abdominal ultrasound and alfa-fetoprotein.\nMean age was 53.83 years. Sofosbuvir/daclatasvir/ribavirin was the most used regimen (35.4%) with 438 patients (83.7%) achieved sustained virologic response (SVR). The median duration for surveillance was 159 weeks. Hundred and five patients developed recurrent HCC, with a crude recurrence rate of 20.1%. There was no difference between HCV responders and non-responders in crude recurrence rate (p = 0.94) but HCC developed earlier in non-responders (p = <0.01).\nRecurrence of HCC remains a threat in HCV patients even after achieving an SVR. Implementation of long-term surveillance programs is highly recommended.', "Placebo response is a powerful determinant of health outcomes in several disorders. Meta-analysis of clinical trials in pain conditions shows that it can contribute up to 75% of the overall treatment effect. Placebo response deriving from different routes of administration is poorly understood in primary headaches' pharmacological prevention. Thus, this meta-analysis aims to analyze how different routes of administration affect the placebo response in chronic migraine (CM). We conducted a meta-analysis with 7 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials, with 5672 patients older than 18 years who suffer from CM without associated comorbidities. We compared those who received a placebo-administered agent for the preventive treatment of CM subcutaneous, endovenous, or oral against those who received multiple head injections. The primary outcome was reduction in the number of days with migraine in the month assessed at 12, 16, and 24 weeks of treatment compared with baseline. Our study shows that placebo responses were greater when botulinum toxin was applied to the head, followed by intravenous injection of the anti-calcitonin gene-related peptide monoclonal antibody eptinezumab. Oral topiramate and subcutaneous monoclonal showed no difference, being inferior to head injection. Administration route affects placebo responses in CM preventive treatment. Elucidating the underlying mechanisms that mediate a placebo response in migraine treatment is beneficial to clinical practice and drug development, especially when comparing drugs with different routes of administration, with the effect of application to the head being superior to the other routes in this study. In our study the placebo response accounted for approximately 75% of the therapeutic gain in the treatment of CM.", 'The aim was to investigate the correlation between ADHD symptom severity and impairments in "theory of mind" (ToM) and empathy, and the improvement in these functions following the administration of methylphenidate (MPH). Fifty children aged 6-12 years with ADHD participated in the study. Symptom severity was assessed using the\xa0Swanson, Nolan and Pelham Questionnaire-IV (SNAP-IV). ToM performance was assessed using the "ToM test" and the "Faux-Pas Recognition Test".\xa0A significant negative correlation was found between the SNAP-IV Conners index, the oppositional and deportment subscales, and ToM test scores. MPH administration improved ToM scores in a magnitude that was negatively correlated with baseline performance. Additionally, Children with more severe behavioral problems showed greater improvement in ToM following administration of MPH. We conclude that severity of ADHD symptoms, most notably behavioral symptoms, is correlated with deficits in ToM. Administration of MPH improves ToM performance, with the greatest improvement occurring in children with more severe behavioral symptoms.', "It is known that antidepressant drugs can induce sleep disorders in patients, but little data exist about high or low-risk molecules. The aim was to study the frequency of antidepressant drugs-induced sleep disorders (DISD) by molecule.\n77,391 patient comments for 32 antidepressant drugs were collected from drug review websites and screened for DISD. Association between drugs and nightmare disorder, restless legs syndrome, sleep paralysis, sleep terrors, sleep-related hallucinations or sleep walking was expressed as relative proportion [proportional reporting ratio (PRR)]. A detailed analysis of the dreams content was also carried out.\nAmitriptyline, doxepin, fluvoxamine, mirtazapine, nortriptyline, trazodone, venlafaxine and vilazodone were associated with a greater frequency of DISD compared to other antidepressants. Vilazodone heavily increased the probability of developing 5 of the 6 studied DISD (PRR 3.3 to 19.3) and mirtazapine increased the probability for developing 4 DISD (PRR 2.4 to 6.4). Bupropion and citalopram were associated with lower probabilities for 5 DISD (PRR 0.2 to 0.7). Sentiment analysis showed that patients described disturbing dreams for vilazodone or mirtazapine and strange but less negative dreams for bupropion, citalopram or duloxetine.\nRelative frequencies of sleep disorders were obtained for a vast panel of antidepressant drugs through an original analysis of user's drug reviews on drug rating websites. Our results could guide clinicians in appropriate choice of antidepressant drug for high DISD-risk patients in need of such treatment. These results may however be cautiously taken, considering the uncertain reliability and generalisability of web-based data.", 'N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) are important for synaptic plasticity associated with many physiological functions and neurological disorders. Protein kinase C (PKC) activation increases the phosphorylation and activity of NMDARs, and α2δ-1 is a critical NMDAR-interacting protein and controls synaptic trafficking of NMDARs. In this study, we determined the relative roles of PKC and α2δ-1 in the control of NMDAR activity. We found that α2δ-1 coexpression significantly increased NMDAR activity in HEK293 cells transfected with GluN1/GluN2A or GluN1/GluN2B. PKC activation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) increased receptor activity only in cells coexpressing GluN1/GluN2A and α2δ-1. Remarkably, PKC inhibition with Gӧ6983 abolished α2δ-1 coexpression-induced potentiation of NMDAR activity in cells transfected with GluN1/GluN2A or GluN1/GluN2B. Treatment with PMA increased the α2δ-1-GluN1 interaction and promoted α2δ-1 and GluN1 cell surface trafficking. PMA also significantly increased NMDAR activity of spinal dorsal horn neurons and the amount of α2δ-1-bound GluN1 protein complexes in spinal cord synaptosomes in wild-type mice, but not in α2δ-1 knockout mice. Furthermore, inhibiting α2δ-1 with pregabalin or disrupting the α2δ-1-NMDAR interaction with the α2δ-1 C terminus peptide abolished the potentiating effect of PMA on NMDAR activity. Additionally, using quantitative phosphoproteomics and mutagenesis analyses, we identified S929 on GluN2A and S1413 (S1415 in humans) on GluN2B as the phosphorylation sites responsible for NMDAR potentiation by PKC and α2δ-1. Together, our findings demonstrate the interdependence of α2δ-1 and PKC phosphorylation in regulating NMDAR trafficking and activity. The phosphorylation-dependent, dynamic α2δ-1-NMDAR interaction constitutes an important molecular mechanism of synaptic plasticity.', 'Migraine is a common neurological disease that often begins in childhood and continues into adulthood; approximately 6 million children and adolescents in the United States cope with migraine, and many frequently experience significant disability and multiple headache days per week. Although pharmacological preventive treatments have been shown to offer some benefit to youth with migraine, additional research is needed to understand whether and how these benefits are sustained.\nTo survey clinical status of youth with migraine who participated in the 24-week Childhood and Adolescent Migraine Prevention (CHAMP) trial over a 3-year follow-up period.\nThis survey study used internet-based surveys collected from youth ages 8 to 17 years at 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 36 months after completion of the CHAMP trial, which randomized participants to amitriptyline, topiramate, or placebo. At the end of the trial, the study drug was stopped, and participants received clinical care of their choice thereafter. The CHAMP trial was conducted between May 2012 and November 2015, and survey follow-up was conducted June 2013 to June 2018. Participants in this survey study were representative of those randomized in the trial. Data were analyzed from March 2020 to April 2021.\nSurvey completion.\nHeadache days, disability (assessed using the Pediatric Migraine Disability Scale [PedMIDAS]), and self-report of ongoing use of prescription preventive medication.\nA total of 205 youth (mean [SD] age, 14.2 [2.3] years; 139 [68%] girls; mean [SD] history of migraine, 5.7 [3.1] years) participated in the survey. Retention of participants was 189 participants (92%) at month 6, 182 participants (88%) at month 12, 163 participants (80%) at month 18, 165 participants (80%) at month 24, and 155 participants (76%) at month 36. Over the course of the 3-year follow-up, participants consistently maintained meaningful reductions in headache days (mean [SD] headache days per 28 days: CHAMP baseline, 11.1 [6.0] days; CHAMP completion, 5.0 [5.7] days; 3-year follow-up, 6.1 [6.1] days) and disability (mean [SD] score: CHAMP baseline, 40.9 [26.4]; CHAMP completion, 17.9 [22.1]; 3-year follow-up, 12.3 [20.0]). At 3 years after completion of the CHAMP trial, headache days were approximately 1.5 per week (changed from about 3 per week at trial baseline) and disability had improved from the moderate range to the low mild range on the PedMIDAS. Longitudinal analyses showed that amitriptyline and topiramate did not explain intercept random effects for either mean rate of headache days per week (amitriptyline: estimate [SE], 0.07 [0.05]; P\u2009=\u2009.16; topiramate: estimate [SE], 0.04 [0.05]; P\u2009=\u2009.50) or headache disability PedMIDAS total score (amitriptyline: estimate [SE], 0.25 [0.38]; P\u2009=\u2009.52; topiramate: estimate [SE], -0.09 [0.39]; P\u2009=\u2009.82) changes over time. Of 153 participants who reported on prescription drug use at 3 years, only 1 participant (1%) reported using prevention medication, and most participants reported no medication use at most time points.\nThese findings suggest that children and adolescents with longer than 5 years history of migraine who participated in the CHAMP trial may sustain positive clinical outcomes over time, even after discontinuing preventive pill-based treatment. This survey study could inform use and discontinuation timing of pharmacological preventive therapies for migraine in youth ages 8 to 17 years. Research is needed to examine mechanisms of treatment improvement and maintenance for preventive therapies, as well as placebo, in the pediatric population.', 'The goal of this American Rhinologic Society expert practice statement (EPS) is to provide clinically applicable, evidence-based recommendations regarding pain management in sinonasal surgery. This EPS was developed following the recommended methodology and approval process as previously outlined. The topics of interest included preoperative counseling, local anesthesia, use of opioids for postoperative pain, use of nonopioid medication for postoperative pain, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and bleeding, and use of gabapentin for pain control. Following a modified Delphi approach, 6 statements were developed, 5 of which reached consensus and 1 that did not. These statements and accompanying evidence are summarized along with an assessment of future needs.']
